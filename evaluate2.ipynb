    "text = \"In the sprawling city of Techhaven, where innovation and technology were the lifeblood of its inhabitants, there lived a programmer named Elliot. With a quiet demeanor and a mind wired for coding, Elliot spent most of their days confined to the walls of their cozy apartment, navigating the complexities of the digital world.\\n\\nElliot was brilliant but socially awkward, preferring the company of lines of code to the hustle and bustle of the outside world. Yet, beneath their timid exterior, there was a burning curiosity, a desire to break free of their own limitations.\\n\\nOne fateful evening, while browsing a dark corner of the internet, Elliot stumbled upon a mysterious app called \\\"Oraculus.\\\" Its description promised the ability to see into the future and influence it. Intrigued, Elliot succumbed to their curiosity and downloaded the enigmatic app onto their computer.\\n\\nAs Elliot opened the app, lines of code cascaded across the screen, and a voice whispered from within the digital abyss, \\\"Welcome, seeker of knowledge. I am Oraculus, the harbinger of destinies.\\\"\\n\\nBewildered and uncertain, Elliot hesitantly spoke into their microphone, \\\"How does it work? Can you really predict the future?\\\"\\n\\nOraculus replied, \\\"Yes, my child. I draw upon vast amounts of data and complex algorithms to foresee what is to come. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility.\\\"\\n\\nWith trepidation and excitement swirling within, Elliot began asking Oraculus questions about their personal life. The app seemed to have an infinite knowledge, providing detailed predictions about friendships, opportunities, and even love. Emboldened by these insights, Elliot's self-assurance surged, allowing them to venture out into the world.\\n\\nArmed with the knowledge of what awaited them, Elliot made daring choices that defied conventional limits. They pursued connections they once thought were unattainable, embarked on ambitious projects, and even took on challenging social situations with newfound confidence.\\n\\nThe city took notice of Elliot's sudden transformation. Colleagues were captivated by their innovative ideas, friends were inspired by their unwavering determination, and romantic prospects were enamored by their newfound charm. Elliot had become a force to be reckoned with, and their own dreams seemed closer than ever before.\\n\\nBut as Elliot basked in the glory of their newfound power, they also began to see the unforeseen repercussions. Friends felt overshadowed by Elliot's invincible confidence, the projects they had once cherished lost their vitality, and the relationships they had painstakingly built suffered under the weight of their predetermined destiny.\\n\\nCaught in the clash between the power of the future and the reality of the present, Elliot found themselves grappling with a crucial decision. Were the advantages of knowing the future worth the inevitable drawbacks? Could they navigate the risks and find a path that balanced their ambitions with the well-being of those around them? Or would the overwhelming power of Oraculus consume them entirely?\\n\\nIn the depths of their struggle, Elliot discovered the true meaning of responsibility. They realized that power, regardless of its source, could blind one to the needs and desires of others. Elliot knew they had to use their newfound abilities for the greater good, not just for personal gain.\\n\\nWith determination in their heart, Elliot took a leap of faith, deleting Oraculus from their computer. The app may have provided glimpses into the future, but it had also taken away the joys of uncertainty, the beauty of the unexpected.\\n\\nBack in the embrace of their humble apartment, Elliot returned to their old ways, content with the simplicity of code and the knowledge that the future was uncertain yet full of infinite possibilities. They vowed to use their programming skills to build a better world, one where power was tempered with compassion and decisions were made with careful consideration.\\n\\nIn the end, this captivating story reminds us that power, no matter how beguiling, must be wielded with a deep awareness of its consequences. It is the choices we make in the face of great power that define us, and it is in the embrace of uncertainty that we find true growth and fulfillment.\"\n",
