      "Valerie stopped running when she saw John Doe, her only avenue of escape blocked off by the vicious murderer. She tried to run towards the nearest house, but John Doe began his slow and torturous approach towards her.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Doe came closer and closer until he was standing right in front of Valerie. Valerie did not try to fight John Doe because she knew he could easily overpower her. She knew that John Doe was going to use his meat cleaver to chop off her head, and just as he swung the blade down towards her neck, she closed her eyes and prepared for death. \n",
      "\n",
      "Valerie opened her eyes when she felt the meat cleaver swing down towards her neck, which meant that John Doe had not killed her yet. He was about to do so, but something made him stop, and he put the meat cleaver down on the ground, instead of killing Valerie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valerie got up from the ground, wiping the blood off her neck and looking at John Doe with an angry and hurt expression on her face. “Why’d you let me go?” she asked angrily. “I told you I wanted to end my life. You promised me that  if I escaped before sunrise you wouldn’t come after me. Why didn’t you keep your promise? Where is the man who was going to let me die in peace?”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, Valerie saw a knife on the floor, and she quickly picked it up and pointed it towards  her own throat, trying to scare John Doe into believing that she was going to kill herself right then and there. “Where is he?” she asked menacingly. “I don’t see him anywhere! He must be dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "John Doe was scared for a moment, but then he remembered that Valerie Marx was just an actress, and he knew that she wasn’t going to actually kill herself. Instead, John Doe would have killed her himself if she had actually done it, and then he would have spent the rest of his life in prison. Valerie Marx had used her acting skills to get him to let her go. He knew that she was pretending to be a suicidal person because he had told her that he would let her escape before sunrise if she did. John Doe knew that Valerie was bluffing because he didn’t think that she was  really going to kill herself just for the sake of getting away from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Doe quickly tried to disarm Valerie by taking the knife out of her hand, but she had already pulled it away from her neck and was ready to attack him. For a brief moment, John Doe thought about trying to get Valerie into a headlock and controlling her with his legs. He had done that trick to five other women, and it always worked out well even when he couldn’t find a weapon. It was too late for John Doe to make a move though because Valerie Marx had already started running towards the door, and she made\n"

      "Devastated by her husband's infidelity, Shannon commits suicide. Her husband, Brad, is left to deal with the aftermath and soon realizes that Shannon was the only good thing in his life.\n",
      "A\n",
      "====================\n",
      "Shannon drove down the road slowly, and her hands continued to shake. She was fighting back tears as she drove and thought about how Brad would feel after she died. She knew he would miss her terribly, but she hoped he would be able to move on with his life and not spend the rest of it regretting that he failed Shannon.\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned onto the small dirt road where her destination was located, and she slowed down even more as she got closer. She could see the water running beneath the bridge in front of her, and she thought about how peaceful it would be when the current swept her away. She put the car into park, and she looked over at the suicide note that she had written for her family just before she left the house. She picked it up, read it one more time, then placed it on the dashboard next to her. She was filled with sadness as she looked at the note and thought about what her suicide would do to Brad.\n",
      "\n",
      "She took a deep breath and turned off the ignition, then opened her door. Shannon reached for the handle on the passenger side of the car and moved it to lock, then she walked slowly towards the edge of the bridge. Her legs moved slowly as she walked, and her thoughts were focused on the end of her life. She wasn’t scared or sad anymore; she was completely at peace with what she was about to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon moved closer to the edge of the bridge and let her feet touch the cool concrete surface. She moved a little further, then she dropped to her knees as the tears started to fall once again. Shannon reached down and lifted up the back of her skirt, then she removed a small black bag from underneath it. She opened the bag, and inside she saw what she wanted: a handful of pills that would soon end her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon moved the hand that held the bag towards her mouth, and she tossed a pill into it before tossing the whole thing into her mouth. She waited a few moments to make sure that it dissolved properly, then she tossed three more pills into her mouth. She swallowed them with water from her bottle before moving to toss a handful of pills into her mouth. Shannon moved to sit down on the edge of the bridge after swallowing these last few pills, then she leaned forward so that her head was in front of her feet. She closed her eyes as tears started to stream down her face once again, and  she waited to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad couldn’t believe what he had just witnessed. He had seen Shannon kill herself, right in front of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He started to sob as he stepped away from the railing and turned to run away from Shannon’s body. He knew that there was nothing he could do to change this, and there was no reason for him to stick around and watch Shannon finish her life. Brad ran all the way to his car before getting inside of it and crumpling against the steering wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad didn’t know what to do with himself. Shannon had just died, and he didn’t know how to move on from this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad began to drive home from Shannon’s house, and he tried to come up with some way to make sense of this tragedy. But no matter how hard Brad tried, he found that he couldn’t make any sense of Shannon’s death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad had come to realize what an incredible impact Shannon had on his life. Brad had realized that he had taken all of that for granted, and now it was too late to appreciate her or all the wonderful things she did for him. And now Shannon was dead because of his selfishness. He had driven Shannon to this tragic end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad began to drive faster as he thought about what a terrible mistake he had made in his life. He knew that he had not only driven Shannon to her death, but also himself into a dark pit of despair and depression.  The anguish he was experiencing seemed to radiate from every pore of his body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad drove faster still as his anguish worsened. But the faster he drove, the more distraught Brad became about Shannon’s death, and the more he felt compelled to do something to bring her back.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was nothing Brad could do now to bring Shannon back. And there was no way for Brad to fix the damage he had done to both himself and Shannon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad needed to accept that Shannon was dead and that there was nothing he could do to bring her back. He needed to forgive himself for his selfishness and move forward with his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon’s funeral was scheduled for the following day. Brad decided to attend, but he did not want to see any of Shannon’s family or friends while they were there. So Brad went out early the day of the funeral and bought himself a new suit to wear to Shannon’s funeral. He also stopped by a drug store and bought some nice cologne.\n",
      "\n",
      "During Shannon’s visitation at the funeral home, Brad watched as friends, family, and members of his church came to pay their respects to Shannon. Among those who paid their  respects was Jodi Gibbons, Shannon’s best friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shannon was a wonderful woman, Brad,” Jodi said after she hugged Brad and told him how sorry she was for his loss. “She really was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jodi moved away from Brad and began to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad was shocked. He did not expect Jodi to be so emotional about Shannon’s death. He knew that Shannon had been a good friend to Jodi, but he did not realize that he had meant so much to her, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jodi wiped the tears from her eyes. Then she put her arms around Brad and hugged him again. She was crying softly as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t believe Shannon is dead,” Jodi said. “I never thought I would have to go through this with her. I was just there with her last week. I took her to the doctor because she wasn’t feeling well, and then we went shopping for groceries at Wal-Mart. We had lunch together on Wednesday, and we talked about you, too. She was worried about you. Shannon didn’t think your moving out of the house was a good idea. But I told her I thought it was for the best.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jodi moved to the counter and pulled out a dish towel, which she handed to Brad.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here – let me wipe your hands and face with this,” Jodi said. “Then you can see Shannon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jodi walked over to the coffin and opened the lid. She looked inside and said, “Shannon, Jodi’s here now. I’m going to bring Brad over so you can talk to him. Shannon, don’t worry; he doesn’t know about us. He doesn’t know that you and I had been having an affair for almost a year. He doesn’t even know that we used to be lovers, too, not that long ago. But you know all about that, Shannon. You were there to see it all happen. You saw Brad and Jodi in bed together only a few days before she broke up with him and went back to Brad. You saw all of it happen, right? We broke up because your husband was such a jerk – remember? He wouldn ’t stop cheating on you. I told Brad if he cared anything at all about you, he would stop seeing me. But he wouldn’t listen to me. He couldn’t make up his mind who he wanted to be with more, me or you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jodi closed the lid and straightened up. “I’m going to go get him. Why don’t you wait here for a minute?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She went out of the room and Brad was left standing there alone with Shannon. She was lying on her back, her arms hanging over the side of the bed. It was hard for Brad to keep his eyes off her and not look at her naked body, even though she had done this before. But this time was different because she wasn’t alive anymore and he felt strange being in the same room with her. He stepped forward and touched her arm, stroking it gently. “I’m so sorry, Shannon. I can’t believe you did this to yourself. You had a lot to live for – a great husband who worshipped the ground you walked on and a beautiful son who needs his mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad sat down on the other side of the bed and put his head in his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon moved slightly so she could look up at him. “I was afraid if I went on living, eventually he’d leave me for someone else or I’d be an old, ugly, fat woman with a saggy body and no self-respect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad laughed. “You have always been beautiful to me and I’m not going anywhere – I love you too much to go through all this pain again. And even if you do get old and fat, I’ll still think you’re the most beautiful woman in the world.” He reached over the bed and took her hand in his, rubbing it gently with his thumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon smiled and squeezed his hand. “I wish I could have met you when we were younger. You make me feel like a teenager again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad smiled back at her. “You’re the only woman I’ve ever been in love with, Shannon – don’t you know that? I should have realized how lucky I was to find someone  like you so early in life.” He leaned over and kissed her gently on the lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon pulled Brad down onto the bed beside her and wrapped her arms around him as he held her tight against his chest. They lay there for a while just holding each other, both feeling a sense of peace and calm that was unusual for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad gently pulled away from Shannon and looked into her eyes. “I better get going – I promised to stop in at my dad’s office this morning before I went home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon nodded and got out of bed, pulling her clothes on as she moved to the door. Brad reached out and touched her hair. “I’ll see you tonight,” he said softly, looking into the beautiful face of his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "She leaned over and gave him a gentle kiss on the lips before heading out the door to her own room. Brad stood there for a moment with his hand still resting on the door handle, then he went into his father’s office and sat down at the conference table as he signed in at the security desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good morning, Mr. Barton,” the receptionist greeted him. “Your father is in conference with the other attorneys – can I get you some coffee?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure, that would be great. Do you have any of those fresh blueberry muffins?” Brad asked as he moved to his father’s office chair. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I think so, let me check,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several minutes passed before the receptionist came back holding a steaming mug of coffee and a plate of warm blueberry muffins. “Here you go, Mr. Barton, sorry for the wait,” she said with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No problem, you’re doing your job – I should just be more patient. Thanks for the breakfast,” Brad said as he took the mug and began pouring himself a cup of coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ate most of the muffin while he read his work email and scanned through the newspaper article about Shannon’s suicide that had been forwarded to him by Karen Spooner.\n",
      "\n",
      "At ten o’clock, the door to Mr. Barton’s office opened and Mr. Barton stepped out into the conference room with his secretary at his heels carrying a few papers in her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good morning, Brad, Karen. Have you had breakfast?” Mr. Barton asked as he approached the two of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, thanks for asking,” Brad replied with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have a meeting this morning with Mr. Taylor, would either of you like to join me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Karen turned to Brad and said, “I can if you want to run upstairs and make sure you have everything you need before work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad nodded his head and said, “Sure. You go ahead – I’ll join you in there in about five minutes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Karen headed out of the room and grabbed a muffin off the table as she walked past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can go in now, Karen, I’ll be right there,” Mr. Barton said as he moved to sit down at his desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karen entered the room and shut the door behind her. She sat down, laid her muffin on the table in front of her and took a sip of coffee from the cup next to it. She opened the paper she had brought with her and began to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karen was wearing a red sweater and a black skirt that met at the knee, but did nothing to hide her long, shapely legs. Her hair was pulled up in a tight bun at the top of her head, exposing just enough of her face to show that she was a very attractive woman. \n",
      "\n",
      "Brad was watching her as she read, taking in the sight of her as he sat there patiently waiting for his father to be ready for their meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had always found Karen to be attractive, even before his wife’s death, but as he looked at her now his admiration of her was heightened. She was everything he had ever wanted in a woman, and yet his thoughts were still always on Shannon.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew that if he were to ever start dating Karen, things would be very awkward with her throughout the time that Shannon’s grave remained in front of his house. It had seemed too much to ask for his father to have the grave moved, and besides that, there was nothing he could do to speed up the process anyway. He had resigned himself to not date anyone until the grave was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karen looked up and saw him watching her as she read the paper. She smiled at him and then put the paper down on her lap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, what time does Jeremy have to be at school on Monday?” Karen asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He needs to be there by eight, so I get him up around seven-thirty,” Brad said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That early, huh? You are going to have your hands full with him there all day. Shannon was always such a great mother to him,” Karen said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know she was,” Brad said. “She loved him very much and did everything she could for him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think Shannon would have moved out of the house if she had not died?” Karen asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I think not. She would have stayed there no matter what, even if we had split up. Her moving out was my decision,” Brad said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After Shannon’s funeral, you moved in with your parents again. Do they mind? Are they tired of having you there after all these years?” Karen asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, they don’t mind at all. They love having me stay with them,” Brad said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know Shannon has a lot of nice things, but where is she going to put everything? How much room does she have now that she is dead? What will happen to her things after she has been buried for a few years? Can the family sell Shannon’s house?” Karen asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know, Karen. I haven’t thought about it much. I guess we could sell the house, but I don’t know if we want to do that. Shannon loved that house. It was her home,” Brad said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think about Shannon every day?” Karen asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I do. I think about her all the time,” Brad said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you ever talk to her?” Karen asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I talk to her all the time. I talk to her in my head,” Brad said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you say to her?” Karen asked.\n",
      "====================\n",
      "”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad pulled Shannon close, wrapping his arms tightly around her. He buried his face in the top of her head and kissed her repeatedly on the top of the head. She could feel him breathing heavily as he held her close, and she gently stroked his back with one hand as they stood there together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shannon, I can’t stand the thought of you being gone. You’re such a huge part of my life, and you make it so much better every single day. I can’t imagine a world without you in it. So please promise me that no matter what, you’ll never leave me like this again. You don’t know how horrible it is to think that I almost lost you. We have so much to live for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon leaned back and stared up into Brad’s face, “I promise I won’t do this ever again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She wrapped her arms around him and they embraced each other tightly, holding each other against the pain they were feeling at this moment. Brad took a small step to the side so he could look down into her eyes. He gently stroked her cheek with his thumb as he said, “I don’t know what I’d do without you. You make my life so wonderful. Every morning when I wake up, it’s because of you that I have the strength to get out of bed and face another day. You’re everything to me, Shannon. I love you so much. You’re the best thing in my life. And if you ever try to leave me again, I won’t let you go. I can’t live without you. I love you so much, Shannon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad brought his lips up to hers for a gentle kiss, and then he took her by the hand and placed it into his. She looked up into his face once more and they gazed at each other lovingly. Brad reached down with the other hand to gently take her by the chin and turn her head so he could kiss her again. Their tongues twisted around and danced around in their mouths while Brad continued to stroke Shannon’s cheek with his thumb. She opened her mouth a little wider to take him inside, and then she brought her hands up to wrap them around his neck as their tongues moved together.  Brad slowly brought his mouth down to hers, and then he pressed his lips firmly against hers, still keeping her face turned toward him so that she could continue kissing him just as passionately. Finally Brad broke the kiss and looked into Shannon’s eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hmmm,” he moaned. “You taste so good, baby. I know you’re stressed out right now, but I think we need to have sex right now. Why don’t you go lock the door while I get a condom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon smiled at Brad and nodded her head before quickly getting up and walking toward the door. She turned around and leaned her head against the door frame before reaching down to pat Brad on his ass as she passed by and whispered, “Thanks for understanding, honey. I’m glad we can still be together after all this.”\n",
      "Brad smiled at Shannon’s words, and he stood up to go get the condom from his night stand drawer. As he walked into the bathroom, he couldn’t help but wonder whether Shannon ever truly understood how much she meant to him or whether she was regretting her decision to commit suicide. He knew that there was a very good possibility that this would be their final time together, and he wanted to make the most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Okay, I’m ready,” Brad called out a few minutes later as he walked back into the bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon came out of her bathroom and smiled at Brad before crawling onto his bed. She took a small step backward before turning around and laying down on the bed face down with her ass sticking up in the air. She motioned for Brad to come over as she asked in a sweet voice, “Are you coming up here or what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad climbed on the bed behind Shannon and felt her firm butt cheeks press up against him as he began kissing her neck and shoulders. He reached down to stroke her thighs before lifting up her blouse and sliding his hand under it to cup her bare breast. As he softly squeezed her breast, he asked in a sexy voice, “Are you sure about this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon didn’t say anything. Instead she moaned softly as Brad continued to caress her right breast. He reached down between her legs and stroked the inside of her thigh with his  fingers before moving them inch by inch toward her vagina.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Brad!” Shannon exclaimed after a few seconds had passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?” Brad asked as he continued to make circles around her vagina with his index finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have a favor to ask you,” Shannon said in a half whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” Brad asked as he stopped moving his finger and started massaging her clit with it instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon looked over her shoulder at Brad and hesitated before speaking. “Please, don’t do anything to me tonight,” she whispered as she buried her face into the pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What? Why?” Brad asked as he felt Shannon’s body stiffen up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon kept her head buried in the pillow and didn’t say anything. Brad continued to rub Shannon’s clit until he felt her body tense up again. Then he removed his fingers from her vagina and stopped rubbing her clit. He got off of Shannon’s back and climbed off of the bed so that he was standing beside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What? Why are you doing that?” Shannon asked as she sat up and looked at Brad.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you please tell me what’s wrong?” Brad asked as he moved closer to Shannon and placed his arm around her shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon hung her head down and closed her eyes before speaking. “I don’t know,” she said softly. “I just… I just can’t tonight,” she continued as she opened her eyes and looked over at Brad. “It’s too soon, I guess,” she added with a little sob.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Shannon, no!” Brad exclaimed as he sat down on the bed next to her. “I’m so sorry! What happened? Did I do something wrong? Was it my fault?” he asked as he held Shannon tightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Brad, you didn’t do anything wrong!” Shannon said while she hugged Brad tight. “It’s really not you, and I don’t know why! I just… I just can’t have sex with you tonight, if it ’s okay,” she added softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad gently stroked her hair as he spoke. “Um… how about if we just try snuggling?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon looked up and smiled as she nodded her head. “That sounds wonderful, Brad. I love to snuggle with you,” she said as she held Brad tight in her arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad kissed the top of Shannon’s head as he held her tightly. “I love you so much, Shannon,” he said with a sigh before closing his eyes and resting his cheek on the top of her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I love you too, Brad,” Shannon whispered as she gently rocked him back and forth. “You know, we don’t have to have sex every night! We can just snuggle in bed together if you want!” she offered softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know, and I wouldn’t mind that at all. I just feel weird when we don’t,” Brad admitted as he opened his eyes to look at Shannon.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Brad smiled and nodded his head. “That would be great,” he said as he placed a quick kiss on her head again.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few minutes of Brad kissing the top of her head, Shannon rolled over and rested against him. “See? It’s just as good! And it’s so much more loving than having sex,” she offered with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad smiled a bit and nodded his head. “I know… but I just want you to be happy, and I miss having sex with you,” he admitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon sighed a bit and looked up at Brad. “Oh, Brad… you have to know how much I love you! And I want to make love with you, believe me! But it just hurts too much right now. Maybe someday we can have sex again, but for now… this will have to do, okay?” she said with a sad smile. \n",
      "\n",
      "Brad nodded his head, and with a sigh, he rolled over and grabbed Shannon’s hand. “Okay, if that’s what you want. I just wanted to make sure you weren’t just trying to avoid having sex with me,” he admitted sheepishly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon looked back at Brad with a smile. “I promise – I’m not avoiding it! I just don’t want to hurt you, and right now… it does hurt too much for me to consider doing that,” she said with sadness in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad nodded and squeezed Shannon’s hand gently. “All right,” he said and then gave her a soft kiss on the lips. “Now let’s snuggle some more, okay?” he suggested with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon chuckled and nodded her head. “Sure, I’d love to. And this… is nice, too,” she said as Brad wrapped his arms around her gently and held her tightly. And they spent the rest of the evening snuggled together on their couch, holding each other close and just enjoying each other’s company.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few moments later, Brad pulled away and looked down at Shannon with a loving smile. “I love you so much, babe – so very much!” he said quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon smiled and pressed her lips to his softly. “I love you, too, Brad – so very much! I just wish we were still having sex…” she said with a wistful sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad glanced down at Shannon and shook his head slightly. “I miss it, too, Shannon… but right now… what we have is more important.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon nodded and smiled at him. “You’re right, I know you’re right… but our sex life is something that I miss. You know that, don’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad nodded and smiled sadly at her. “I know… I miss it, too. But we don’t have to make love every night, you know… just once in a while would be nice – like tonight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon frowned slightly and looked away. But she sighed  and nodded. “I know,” she said quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan Barton suddenly walked into the room and stared in shock at his son and daughter-in-law. “What are you two doing?” he asked angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad bit his lip nervously and glanced down at Shannon. Shannon could feel the heat rising in her cheeks as she looked up at Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No… we haven’t…” Brad started. “Shannon and I were just… we were just talking, Dad!” Brad stammered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan raised an eyebrow at the couple. He then cleared his throat and looked away, trying to hide a smile. He cleared his throat again and said, “Good. Well, you two have talked enough for tonight. Now run along to bed. Brad, have you given any more thought to that job offer at the firm?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon looked at Brad with alarm. She had hoped to talk about their relationship and what was wrong with it before anything was mentioned about working in Dan’s law firm again. But as usual, when she wanted something from Brad he did the opposite of what she wanted. “Uh, yeah… I have given it some thought,” Brad said reluctantly. “I just don’t know if I want to work in a law office again, Dad. I mean… what am I going to be doing? It’s not like you need some guy taking phone calls all day or something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon was livid. She could see Brad wanting to work in the law office again—it had been his dream when he was younger—but she also knew that Brad didn’t love working for his father like he once had. “Brad,  I don’t want you to work for your father… unless you want to, of course.” Dan looked at her with surprise; Shannon rarely talked back to her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two exchanged a few words and decided to keep the issue open until Brad filled out the paperwork and started working in the office. “Karen, I’d like you to meet my oldest daughter, Shannon. She’s a bit of a fireball, isn’t she?” Dan asked his girlfriend. “Wow, yeah… that was definitely an understatement! What were you saying about working with me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t said anything about working with you. I just said that I can see why your wife would want to work for you if it was fun, but is it—?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon was sick of the way Brad was acting. He hadn’t shown an ounce of concern about her since she’d left him a month ago, and now he was practically drooling over Karen. “Just because I don’t want to work here doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t. I just don’t think it’s a good idea for you to follow in your dad’s footsteps. I don’t think you have good judgment when it comes to things like this. You want the truth? Your dad is a self-centered jerk. I can see why my older sister married him, though; he’s wealthy and he can keep her in expensive clothes and jewelry. But he’ll never love her or care about her like she deserves. And I think that’s what you want, isn’t it? What you deserve—to be loved and cared about. Well, let me tell you one thing. You don’t show a girl you care about her by lying to her for four years and having an affair with her sister. No, Brad Barton. You aren’t going to find a better job or better people in this town than in your dad’s firm, and you know it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shannon, I love you. I always have and I always will. It doesn’t matter what we do for a living or where we live; all that matters is that we’re together. I want us to get pregnant again right away. I want  to start our own business. I want to make you happy, Shannon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon sat up straighter, her eyes narrowing at him. “You are not going to turn my family against me. You can see them when and if they come to the funeral, but we are not going out anymore. After it’s over, I don’t want to see you anymore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad was staring at her now. His face was pained, almost as if he were in physical pain from the intensity of his feelings for her. “You don’t mean that, Shannon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon stood up and turned to face him, tears streaming down her cheeks. “I do mean it. I want to be with Jeremy and my family and your daughter for the rest of my life—but I don’t want you to be a part of it! Do you understand what I’m saying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brad stood up now, his face red with anger. “No, Shannon! No!” He pushed at her, his arms outstretched as if he were trying to stop her from leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shannon continued to stand her ground. She was trembling with anger and, she realized, with sadness as well. Suddenly, she felt overwhelmed by grief and collapsed on the floor. Brad rushed over to her, his arms reaching for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shannon! Shannon, please don’t do this. I need you, Shannon. I need you in my life. Don’t leave me alone…don’t do this to us,” he pleaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "She pushed at him again and again and again until he finally backed away from her. “Oh, God…I’m so sorry, Brad,” she cried. “I didn’t mean to make you feel bad…you deserve better than me…Jeremy deserves better than this. I should just go away and leave you alone, but I just can’t do it. I can’t, Brad. I can’t!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood there staring at her for a long moment before walking over to the couch and sitting down, his head in his hands. Shannon sat down on the floor beside him and pulled her legs up against her chest. She rested her cheek on her knees for a moment before looking over at him. His head was still in his hands, but she could see the tears running down his cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m so sorry, Shannon,” he whispered.\n"

With a quiet demeanor and a mind wired for coding, Elliot spent most of their days confined to the walls of their cozy apartment, navigating the complexities of the digital world.\\n\\nElliot was brilliant but socially awkward, preferring the company of lines of code to the hustle and bustle of the outside world. Yet, beneath their timid exterior, there was a burning curiosity, a desire to break free of their own limitations.\\n\\nOne fateful evening, while browsing a dark corner of the internet, Elliot stumbled upon a mysterious app called \\\"Oraculus.\\\" Its description promised the ability to see into the future and influence it. Intrigued, Elliot succumbed to their curiosity and downloaded the enigmatic app onto their computer.\\n\\nAs Elliot opened the app, lines of code cascaded across the screen, and a voice whispered from within the digital abyss, \\\"Welcome, seeker of knowledge. I am Oraculus, the harbinger of destinies.\\\"\\n\\nBewildered and uncertain, Elliot hesitantly spoke into their microphone, \\\"How does it work? Can you really predict the future?\\\"\\n\\nOraculus replied, \\\"Yes, my child. I draw upon vast amounts of data and complex algorithms to foresee what is to come. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility.\\\"\\n\\nWith trepidation and excitement swirling within, Elliot began asking Oraculus questions about their personal life. The app seemed to have an infinite knowledge, providing detailed predictions about friendships, opportunities, and even love. Emboldened by these insights, Elliot's self-assurance surged, allowing them to venture out into the world.\\n\\nArmed with the knowledge of what awaited them, Elliot made daring choices that defied conventional limits. They pursued connections they once thought were unattainable, embarked on ambitious projects, and even took on challenging social situations with newfound confidence.\\n\\nThe city took notice of Elliot's sudden transformation. Colleagues were captivated by their innovative ideas, friends were inspired by their unwavering determination, and romantic prospects were enamored by their newfound charm. Elliot had become a force to be reckoned with, and their own dreams seemed closer than ever before.\\n\\nBut as Elliot basked in the glory of their newfound power, they also began to see the unforeseen repercussions. Friends felt overshadowed by Elliot's invincible confidence, the projects they had once cherished lost their vitality, and the relationships they had painstakingly built suffered under the weight of their predetermined destiny.\\n\\nCaught in the clash between the power of the future and the reality of the present, Elliot found themselves grappling with a crucial decision. Were the advantages of knowing the future worth the inevitable drawbacks? Could they navigate the risks and find a path that balanced their ambitions with the well-being of those around them? Or would the overwhelming power of Oraculus consume them entirely?\\n\\nIn the depths of their struggle, Elliot discovered the true meaning of responsibility. They realized that power, regardless of its source, could blind one to the needs and desires of others. Elliot knew they had to use their newfound abilities for the greater good, not just for personal gain.\\n\\nWith determination in their heart, Elliot took a leap of faith, deleting Oraculus from their computer. The app may have provided glimpses into the future, but it had also taken away the joys of uncertainty, the beauty of the unexpected.\\n\\nBack in the embrace of their humble apartment, Elliot returned to their old ways, content with the simplicity of code and the knowledge that the future was uncertain yet full of infinite possibilities. They vowed to use their programming skills to build a better world, one where power was tempered with compassion and decisions were made with careful consideration.\\n\\nIn the end, this captivating story reminds us that power, no matter how beguiling, must be wielded with a deep awareness of its consequences. It is the choices we make in the face of great power that define us, and it is in the embrace of uncertainty that we find true growth and fulfillment.\"\n",
