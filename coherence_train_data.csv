The group of survivors must face the enemy and defeat him in order to survive in this new world.,"continued, “Thank you, we promise that we will take good care of you if you help us.” The men nodded their heads as the group led them out of the pit, which was filled with water and dead animals, into a cave.

They then started to move further into the cave when a man came out of nowhere and threw a bag at their feet, which contained two fish. The man then spoke in the language that they just heard Maria Martinez speak, before he turned and ran back into the darkness of the cave.

Maria Martinez smiled and reached for one of the fish before she spoke to the men, “These are our dinner for tonight.” She then looked at the other members of her group before she added, “Please try to eat as much as you can because we need your strength tonight.” She then pulled out a fishing hook from her pocket, which she tied to the end of a stick, before she handed it to one of the men and told him where to stand.

She then explained to the other men where they needed to stand before she started walking towards an area that looked like the perfect spot for them to set up their camp. As she was walking she looked over her shoulder to see what the other men were doing, and when she looked forward again she saw that they had already caught their first fish. She smiled as she walked further into the cave until it got dark, and when it did she turned around and walked back to the area where the other men were standing, which was filled with hundreds of fish.

She then told the men to bring the fish closer so she could see how many they had caught, and in a few seconds they arrived at the spot she had told them to stand at. When they did, all Maria could do was smile as she looked back at the small group of survivors, who now had several fish in their hands, and at first glance it seemed like they might have caught more than fifty.

Since it was likely that the rest of their dinner was already in the nearby water, Maria Martinez told them to turn around and start walking back towards where they had started before she went into a crouching position and moved underneath to water. When she did, she held out her hands until they were just touching the water, and when she felt something touch down on her skin, she grabbed onto it with both hands and pulled it up until what she was holding was finally revealed. 

When she opened her eyes, she saw that it was in fact a small fish, which had probably been too small to catch the eye of any of the other people in her group.

The woman then kept looking around until she had spotted several more fish just under the water, and as soon as this happened, she ordered the men to sit down next to her. When they did, she told them that now was the time for them to come up with a plan of what they should do with the rest of their evening.

“I think we should go to bed early tonight, before it gets too dark outside,” said Johnathan Prescott, whose mind was still trying to recover from all the things that he had seen in this world.

“Yeah, good idea. I think we should all be exhausted by tomorrow morning, and we might even fall asleep before the sun goes down,” said Ratzinger Kugelman, who was trying to sound as normal as he could after his long ordeal.

“As soon as we get back to where we first came from, I’m going to go and talk to him again,” Maria Martinez then told the men. “I don’t know if he can understand me, but maybe he can tell us more about this world. Who knows? Maybe there are some other people out there who are like him, and we might be able to have more people join our group!”

After a few moments of debate over this, the three men agreed that they should listen to what Maria had to say. When they arrived back at the cave, Marie told them that when she was talking to the creature in the darkness of the cave earlier, she had been speaking another language that she had learned when she was a child growing up in Puerto Rico.

“I have no idea how I know this language, or where I could have possibly learned it from, but I do know a little bit about it. I just hope that this creature can understand me,” she then said with a sigh before leaving for the cave once again.

When she arrived there, Ratzinger Kugelman was once again waiting for her, and Maria sat down beside him as she had done before. As soon as he began talking to her again, she began speaking in the language that he had heard her speak the night before. 

“What do you want with me and these people?” Maria said to him, and his reply was a single word: “Freedom.”

After hearing this response, Maria began speaking to him again. “Why do you want freedom?” she asked him, and he gave her a complex and long-winded answer that made no sense to any of the men. When she finished asking him all of her questions, Maria sat back and thought about everything that he had told her.

“I don’t understand what you are saying, but I do understand why you are here. I think it is a very noble cause. In fact, I would like to help you achieve your goals if it is at all possible for me to do so. How can we help you?” she then asked him, and his answer was once again a single word: “Defeat.”

After hearing him say this, Maria looked at him with puzzlement, but then a sudden rush of ideas came to her. “What if we were to fight you in an arena? That would give you the freedom that you seek, and it is something that I believe could be accomplished quite easily.” The man appeared satisfied by this response, and said a single word: “Tomorrow.”

Tomorrow morning, the group of survivors woke up in their tents to see a large group of men and women coming down the beach towards them. Some of these people were carrying knives and swords, while others appeared to be carrying shields. As the two groups got closer and closer together, they looked at each other with some measure of suspicion.

Maria was standing in front of her tent when the group of fighters reached them, but she did not seem very afraid. Her eyes scanned over each one of the men and women before her, and she saw a person who was about twenty-five years old with dark brown hair and a strong jaw line. He was carrying what appeared to be a sword, but he didn’t have any kind of armor on. His physique suggested that he might be quite strong. As he walked forward, the rest of his company stepped aside, and Maria was able to get a better look at him.

She decided that he did not appear to be a very frightening opponent, and this gave her some confidence. As he came near her, she stepped forward and extended her hand in greeting. “My  name is Maria Martinez,” she said.

The young man looked her over for a moment and then shook her hand. “My name is Miguel,” he replied.

The two of them made small talk for a moment before the rest of the fighters began walking towards the camp. Once the rest of them were out of earshot, the woman asked him how long they had been on the island.

“About three months now,” he replied.

Maria raised her eyebrows at this and then looked up at the sky, which was still getting darker by the second. “Don’t we need to head back before it gets too dark?” she asked.

He shrugged his shoulders and then looked at her with a sad expression. “No, not really,” he said.

She was surprised by this answer and replied that she did not understand what he meant. “Why do you say that?” she asked in frustration.

He shrugged again and began to walk back towards the camp as they talked. “We don’t really need to go back before it gets dark, because we’re going to die tonight,” he replied.

Maria was taken aback by this statement and stopped walking. “I don’t understand, why are you saying we’re going to die?” she asked.

The young man looked at her and then shook his head. “You don’t understand? I thought you were smarter than that,” he said with a sigh.

She was becoming more frustrated and angry at this point. “I don’t understand what you mean because you haven’t told me anything!” she yelled back at him.

He rolled his eyes and then began to walk away from her. “I don’t have the time for this now, we’ll talk about it later,” he said as he walked away from her.

Maria was very upset by this and shouted after him for him to  stop. She was obviously following him and asking when he would tell her what was going on because she didn’t want to die tonight or anytime soon. She eventually caught up with him once again.

“What do you mean there are going to be fights tonight? What kind of fights? What do you mean islanders are going to be fighting each other?” she asked as she walked up next to him.

The young man stopped walking and stared at her for a moment. “You really don’t know, do you?” he said with a slight laugh. “None of you do,” he continued. “It’s alright though because we will tell you everything when we meet again tomorrow night. We have to meet here and celebrate our victory over the islanders now,” he finished as he grabbed her arm and pulled her toward the arena.

Maria was still very confused by what was going on, but she stopped struggling and just let herself be led into the arena. As she walked in she noticed that it was very quiet in there now, which was unusual because people were always screaming and cheering for their favorite fighters. It seemed like the entire island had come to watch this fight.

“Why are you fighting me?” she asked as they reached the center of the arena.

The young man turned to face her and looked at her very seriously. “You were right earlier when you said that none of us know what is happening here. The islanders who live on this island were used to being treated poorly and as a result, they were very timid and lazy. They never wanted to work for anything, but when the world ended they were forced to rely on themselves for everything. Now that we have defeated the enemy, the islanders realize that they can be anything they want to be. They are no longer limited by their own fear and insecurity.”

“But why does that mean you have to fight me?” Maria asked.

“It doesn’t,” the young man replied. “I don’t have to fight you, but I want to. I want to show you that I am not afraid of anything anymore. I am no longer the same person I was before. I am stronger now and I can do anything I set my mind to.”

With that, he turned and walked away from her, leaving her standing there in the center of the arena alone.",0
"Valerie Marx wakes up in a dark basement, bound and gagged.","Valerie Marx woke and found herself lying on the concrete floor of a dank basement.

The room stank of rotting things and mold. She smelled urine, feces, and other noisome bodily fluids. Valerie turned on her side to see how she was tied. Her wrists were fastened behind her back with a dirty twine and her ankles and knees were also fastened with twine, but she could not recognize the material. She tried to move, but the bindings were too tight. Valerie was in a small dark room, and there was no visible window, only a rectangular slit that appeared to be a basement door. She strained against her bindings, trying to get free.

Valerie felt a light touch on her left foot, above the ankle. The touch made her skin crawl. There was a bump on the sole of her foot and it seemed to be digging into Valerie’s flesh. She pulled back her foot quickly in revulsion and found herself in a sharp twist of darkness. She rolled over on her back, trying to reach her right foot, but the darkness was too thick. Valerie realized she was in a blindfold of some sort. She could see nothing except a dark blur at the periphery of her vision. Valerie began to feel faint and realized she was beginning to lose consciousness. She pulled herself up on all fours, determined not to fall unconscious. She found that she was beginning to run out of air; the basement stank with a particular pungency that made her throat burn. 

She felt along the wall, but hit something hard before her hand reached what she was searching for. There was a faint hum of electricity, and suddenly Valerie felt hot pain and prickling all over her body. She screamed at the top of her lungs, hoping someone would hear her. Valerie pushed herself along the ground, trying to escape the pain. She found that her hands were now free, but she still had her feet tied together.

Valerie pushed herself back along the ground as fast as she could, feeling around with her feet for anything that might be useful. She ran into something hard yet yielding. Valerie realized it was a door. She pushed the door open and stumbled out of the small room, into a larger one with cement walls. She tried to open her eyes and realized her hands were still bound.

Valerie tried to free herself frantically but found that she couldn’t break the  binds, even though her hands were numb from struggling so hard.

She heard a shuffling noise and then a quiet click upstairs. Valerie panicked and struggled harder, but all she could hear for a moment was the dull sound of her own desperate breathing. Then she heard shuffling downstairs again, and then a loud, heavy thump as something big dropped to the floor above Valerie. She could hear the footsteps of whoever it was run down stairs, and she realized that whoever it was had managed to find her and was hunting her in the basement. Valerie started to panic, trying desperately to escape from her binds. She began kicking at the basement walls, trying to find something useful.

Valerie suddenly felt a sharp pain on the back of her legs and realized she had found something useful. She had managed to find a box of tools, which included some wire cutters. She started to cut through her binds. 

As she struggled to free herself, Valerie heard a soft thud behind her and turned around. She saw two doors in the corner of the room, and as she stared at them they both snapped shut with a loud hiss. Valerie knew there was no way out of the room. She decided to smash a  window, hoping that it would allow her to escape. She reached for the closest brick and swung it with all her might at the glass, breaking a bit of it but not enough to make a hole. Valerie dropped the brick and looked around for another. She saw some cinder blocks stacked up against the wall, and she grabbed one before dropping it on the window. It shattered loudly, and Valerie could see the bright sky through it. Then she heard footsteps behind her again and knew that she needed to escape quickly before the killer caught her.

Valerie ran over to the window and took a look outside. The window was too high for her to reach, and she had no choice but to try the doors. She walked over to one of them and tried to open it, but it was locked. Valerie reached for the other door only to find it also locked tight. She opened her mouth to scream but found a long gag in her mouth. Valerie tried once again to open the door, but it would not budge. She found a small window in the upper corner and looked through it. It was too small for her to fit through.

Valerie found a small vent near the window, and she stuck her head inside of it just as someone started",1

Valerie makes it to safety and the police catch John Doe.,"behind my back, I could just keep turning over until I found the button then unlatch myself.”

“So you do think that you can escape?” John Doe asked.

Valerie looked at him for a moment before replying. “Yes, I think that I can escape.”

“Then tie your hands behind your back, and we’ll see if you can really do it,” John Doe said. He moved across the basement to his suitcase and searched through it until he found a length of rope. He returned to Valerie and tied her hands behind her back. Valerie tried to grab the cuffs, but they were too far away from her.

“Are you happy now?” she asked him, trying not to let panic creep into her voice.

John Doe grinned at her. “I’m always happy when I have someone tied up,” he replied. He turned and started pacing around the basement again.

“So do you think that I can really escape?” Valerie asked him. “You seem very certain that I can’t.”

John Doe stopped pacing. He turned to look at Valerie and said, “I know you can’t.”

Valerie frowned. “How do you know?” she asked. “You haven’t seen anything yet. Maybe I’ll surprise you.”

John Doe’s grin widened. “You might surprise me,” he said, “but I doubt it. You’re just trying to get my guard down so that you can escape while I’m not looking. Well, it won’t work. You’ll be stuck in here until morning, then I’ll drag you up to the attic and become famous for adding your head to my collection of trophies.” He paused and said, “Of course, I could always let you go now if you want.”

Valerie frowned. “Why would you do that?” she asked. “You have me tied up. If you let me go, I can’t help you, and then the police will find out who you are and put an end to your murderous ways. And don ’t be so sure that they won’t find you even if I do stay here until morning. How many head starts have you given other women? Do you know that all it takes is for them to turn the police in and they can track down where you are? All of them, John Doe, and they’ll come here to get me out, and then you’re finished.”

John Doe shook his head as if he didn’t believe her, but he said nothing more.

Valerie smiled. “So will you let me go now, or should I wait for the police?”

“No, I won’t let you go. You don’t know what you are talking about. And when they do come, and find me here with you, do you really think that they will believe that I am holding a woman prisoner against her will?”

Valerie shook her head. “You’re right,” she said at last. “You do know what you are doing. And of course they wouldn’t believe it, but what choice would they have? You wouldn’t be the first serial killer to rape and strangle young girls only to return them home before dawn. I don’t know how many other women you have killed, but you must be used to the police by now. I’m sure they already know that you like to hide in basements and sewers so that no one will ever be able to find you again. I expect that you are very good at it now, but there’s one thing they don’t yet know. And that is what I am going to tell them now. If you come with me quietly, they might even let you go even though I am still here, but if you make any trouble, then…”

“What will you do? You can’t do anything to me. I have done nothing wrong. Come on, let’s get this over with. It’s going to be dawn soon and I have to get back. You will just make it harder for me to get out of here.”

Valerie glanced at the clock on the wall behind him. “It won’t be long now,” she told him. “It’s almost dawn. And in a few minutes  the police are going to come pounding on your door and drag you off to the clink. You can just sit here and wait. I promise not to tell them any of your secrets.”

He didn’t say anything, but Valerie could see that he was listening to her carefully. She couldn’t tell whether or not he believed what she was telling him or if it had taken his mind off of what he was planning and wondering how long he would have to wait until the police came. He looked as though he were trying to think of a way out, either for himself or for Valerie. Maybe even both of them. Valerie waited patiently for him to make the decision, whatever it was going to be. Finally he nodded and said, “All right. It’s up to you. Will you let me go?”

Valerie felt a rush of relief and joy, but quickly suppressed it. She had to be sure that he was serious. “You mean it?” she asked him, watching his face carefully for any sign that he might again decide to change his mind.

“Of course I mean it,” he replied. “Don’t worry. I’ll behave myself.”

Valerie tried to think of some way to make sure that he did as he promised before she responded. She had been so afraid that he would hurt her if she did not go along with what he wanted, so she had agreed to surrender without a fight. But then he was telling her that he would let her go. “All right. I’ll untie you, but only if you tell me where you’re going. If I don’t know where to look for you, I won’t be able to call the police and they might not be able to stop me. You wouldn’t want that, would you?”

John Doe shook his head. “No, of course not. I’ll tell you where I’m going if you untie me. If you don’t trust me, we can tie each other up again.”

Valerie agreed to John Doe’s plan, and he told her a few minutes later that she could get up. He was lying on his stomach on the floor, with his hands behind him and his ankles tied together. Valerie was still bound and sitting on  a chair in front of him. He smiled at her, and she could see that he was enjoying being the one with all the power for once.

“You did a pretty good job tying me up. I really thought I might have to kill you after you got away from me last night, but then I figured that maybe I wouldn’t have to if you were willing to help me. The way you acted, I bet everyone thinks you’re really brave.”

Valerie blushed and said nothing. She didn’t like the way he was looking at her all of a sudden, and she started to feel sick again.

“It’s true, isn’t it? You did do a brave thing. You helped me find another victim, and you helped me by sitting here while I explained to you how I do it. Why don’t we both keep our mouths shut about what happened here today, and you can go back to your life and I’ll go back to mine.”

He started to get up, and Valerie panicked. She didn’t want him anywhere near her.

“No, please don’t go! The police will be here soon, and they’ll catch you! Please, John, don’t leave me here alone with him!”

She started to cry, and Male Celebrity A put his arm around her.",0
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"he had to be careful not to lose any of his stuff in the process, but he managed. He put away everything except for the chicken and some vegetables – those would become his lunch tomorrow. Then he sat down on his bed again and pulled out his laptop, opening up a browser window to go through some job search engines. There was nothing nearby at the moment, but he figured this way it wasn’t as bad as wasting gas driving around town.

As he browsed, Gabriel noticed that the wall clock across the room had stopped suddenly. He frowned, and went to unplug it from its power source when, without warning, the lights in his apartment flickered off and on a couple of times. They grew steadily brighter until they blazed like the sun in his eyes, accompanied by a rumbling noise that sounded like an earthquake was about to happen.

Gabriel blinked at his computer screen for a moment before realizing that nothing had changed on the screen – he wasn’t sure if he’d not noticed the light change or if his eyes had never adjusted to it. Either way, he pushed his laptop aside and walked over to the window, staring out at the street below for a moment.

Now that he’d gotten a good look at the area outside, it wasn’t nearly as surprising as he thought. Though his apartment complex was located on a small street out of view of most of the town, there were tons of lights flashing and people milling about down there, apparently in a panic. Gabriel heard shouting and even saw a few people running on the sidewalk, but he couldn’t tell what they were shouting or why they were running.

The noise from the street gradually grew louder until it sounded like people were yelling right outside Gabriel’s window. He stood up and leaned his head out, only to find that everything was still totally silent outside. He noticed that there were a few more people on the street now – mostly walking about, but one man had stopped in front of a building, his arms flailing wildly as he yelled at someone beyond the man’s view.

Gabriel didn’t have time to puzzle over what was going on before the noises from the street abruptly stopped and he heard a loud thump outside. Curious, Gabriel stepped over to the window again.

A few seconds later, another loud thump sounded. Then another one. Soon after,  a groan sounded from down the street.

Gabriel walked over to his door and peered through the peephole, but all he saw outside was more darkness and flashing lights from passing cars. He turned off the light and walked back toward his bed. Before he sat down, he turned the TV on again.

A few minutes later, Gabriel heard another groan and a faint shout. He got up and opened his door to peek out, but all he saw were people running about in front of Gabriel’s building, some standing in their balconies watching the commotion, and a few people in the middle of the street who appeared to be helping someone up.

Gabriel closed his door and went back to his bed, thinking that at least things seemed to have calmed down.

Then Gabriel heard another groan. This time it came from somewhere down the hall near his door. He sat back up, walked over to the door, and carefully opened it.

Just as he had done before, Gabriel peered out into his hall in search of any signs of movement. Suddenly he heard a voice from behind him say “Hello?”, and when he turned around he saw a tall man who was standing in the doorway of his apartment with a confused look on his face.

The tall man looked down the hall to make sure no one was there. Then he came inside, shut the door, and looked around Gabriel’s apartment. The tall man appeared to be in his twenties, with medium-length black hair that fell well below his ears. His skin was a little pale, but not sickly. He held out his hand and introduced himself while still looking around Gabriel’s apartment as if he expected to find something there.

Gabriel shook the man’s hand and introduced himself as well. “I’m Gabriel Martin,” he said. “Nice to meet you. How are you doing?”

The tall man said “I don’t really know yet… I just got here,” and looked around Gabriel’s apartment again. “This is a nice place… How long have you been here?”

Gabriel looked at the man quizzically and said “Just three months.” Then he added “And it isn’t much  of a place, but it’s getting the job done.”

Gabriel noticed some things that were different about the tall man from what he usually saw in men his own age. For one thing, the tall man was obviously very muscular, with big biceps and shoulders, thick triceps, a well-defined chest, abs that showed through his shirt, and a strong pair of legs. The tall man also had facial hair; he was clean-shaven on top of his head but had thick black stubble on the bottom half of his face. His skin was tanned and his eyes were brown.

The tall man nodded in understanding and said “I can see that… Well, it looks like you’ve made yourself right at home here.” Gabriel chuckled and said “Well, I’ve been doing a lot of cleaning and unpacking lately… I’m getting settled into the place. And that girl up there, she helps me out a lot too.”

The tall man nodded again and said “Oh yeah? She sounds pretty nice… What’s her name?” Gabriel smiled and said “Her name is Lina, and she is.” The tall man said “So she lives with you then?” Gabriel answered “Yeah, she does. We met in the neighborhood.”

The tall man seemed to be intrigued by this news. “So how long have you guys been together?” he asked. Gabriel said “We’re not really together… We just kind of hang out once in a while. But I think she’s interested in me. I mean, there was that time when she was crying and I came home and found her like that, and I comforted her. And then she just kissed me… I mean, it didn’t feel like a real kiss or anything. She just did it out of pity, you know? Just a little peck on the lips. But still!”  Gabriel chuckled and said “I didn’t know how to feel about it at first. But I guess now I do like her… not that much, but enough to want to date her.”

The tall man raised his eyebrows and said “You don’t sound too sure about that.” Gabriel blinked and said “I guess I just can’t believe it yet. It feels so weird to have a girlfriend, you know? She’s my first relationship… Ever! And she’s only my second girl, period! I mean, the first girl was a friend of mine, and when I kissed her, it was just for fun. But this… This is different! This is like… A date!” Gabriel grinned and said “And I just can’t believe that she would ever date me! She could get any guy in the city, but she  chose me! I mean, me…! Not that you’d know it from looking at me, but inside, I’m not so great. I have my flaws. And my insecurities. And there’s a lot about me that you don’t know… but she loves me anyway. She accepts me for who I am, and she doesn’t care what the other people say. It’s so weird, but it feels so good! It feels… grown-up!”

The tall man put a hand on Gabriel’s shoulder and said, “Son, that’s love. That’s what you call someone who truly loves you. Love is something special. You can have relationships without love, or sex without love, but when you find someone who cares about you enough to look past your flaws and accept you for who you are… that’s when you know that person is special. Don’t let her go.”

Gabriel laughed, “That’s the funny thing. She already left. I’m alone now! The first time I went out on my own and met someone outside of school, and I lost her before we even started. I really like her, but she doesn’t want to see me anymore. How could she say that? She said she wanted to get to know me more… but then she just walked away!”

The tall man shook his head, “You’ll find somebody else. It always happens like that. There’s a huge pool of women out there. You just need to start looking for the right one. And don’t worry about losing her, because I promise you that you will lose her eventually. Everyone does.”

Gabriel laughed, “Sure they do.”

The tall man smiled too, “I know it sounds hard, but try to think positively. You can’t get down on yourself because you lose someone. All you can do is learn from the experience and move on. But that doesn’t mean I don’t understand where you’re coming from. Believe me, I know what it feels like to want to be with someone who doesn’t want to be with you. It sucks.” 

Gabriel nodded, “Yeah, it does. I just feel…”

The tall man interrupted him, “You feel like you’re growing up, don’t you? You think that this is your first taste of being an adult, and that a girl walking out on you makes you more grown-up. But it doesn’t. We all learn how to lose people when we’re kids. But I promise you that there will be other girls. And this one that just walked away from you isn’t the only one in the world. That’s what love is all about. Finding someone else when she walks away. Until that happens, you’re not an adult yet. Get back to me when you lose your job, and then maybe I’ll consider you a grown-up.”",1
Daisy ultimately beats cancer and her story inspires hope in her community.,"little signs of it coming back. I think that you just have to always live your life knowing that one day it could come back.”

Daisy nodded and said, “I know, honey. I guess I was just feeling sorry for myself for a minute.” She smiled at her daughter and said, “You have been a wonderful daughter through all of this. I don’t know what I would do without you.”

Lisa smiled and said, “I love you, too, Mom.” After a moment she said, “Has anyone ever told you that you have a very soothing voice?”

Daisy blinked in surprise. “Really? I think that it carries sometimes when I don’t want it to, but soothing? That’s really nice to hear. Where did you learn to be so comforting?”

Lisa shrugged her shoulders and said, “I just know what I would want if it were me so I try to do the same thing for everyone else. As far as your voice is concerned, it just seems like the right thing to say sometimes.”

Daisy sat up on her side of the bed and said, “Well, thank you. I think that I will start practicing my soothing voice this afternoon.”

Lisa laughed and said, “You should!” She looked at her watch and said, “Well, I have a few minutes before I have to be at work, so why don’t you tell me what is really bothering you.”

Daisy nodded and said, “Well, my surgery was yesterday and I still don’t feel any better. I mean, I know that I will eventually, but it doesn’t seem like it should be taking this long. And now they tell me that the surgery was more complicated than they thought, and it is going to take much longer for me to recover. It just makes me so angry because I felt fine before the surgery and now I don’t. I know that they did what they thought was right, but why didn’t they know it would be so hard on me?”

Lisa smiled at her mother and said, “I think I can guess the only answer to that question. But you know what the real problem  is with thinking like that? We are not going to get anywhere unless we try to accept what has happened and focus on how we feel about it.”

Daisy said, “I just want my life back. I want to be able to go and do what I want, when I want. I want to go back to my house and live there again instead of in a hospital.”

Lisa nodded and said, “Well, at least we got you here, where they can take good care of you.”

Daisy felt a strong desire to cry that seemed like it would shake her to pieces, but she had been through so much already and she knew that it would waste time.

Lisa said, “You know what I think the problem is?”

“What?” Daisy asked.

Lisa looked Daisy right in the eyes and said, “You just can’t accept that even though you have faced a great deal of adversity in your life, like me, it was nothing compared to what you have gone through in the last few days. You got a broken arm or had to wear a cast on your leg and you learned how to do things differently until it healed, but you have never faced anything that caused you to wonder if you would ever get better. You have never faced the possibility of death and maybe that makes it harder to accept this situation.”

Daisy said, “I told myself over and over before we even got here that I was going to die, but it hasn’t sunk in yet. I remember when you broke your wrist and you were depressed for weeks. I didn’t think I would ever get you out of that state because you couldn’t accept what happened to your arm and it was hard for you to adjust. But, you did accept it and got through it.”

Lisa said, “But, I really had no choice; I had to use my arm in some way or other even though I was depressed. You can’t do that right now; we have taken away your ability to do the things you normally would do.”

Daisy said, “That is true, but I don’t know why I keep getting all worked up over this. I used to be able to deal with things and see the positive side of things. I don’t know where all  this negative thinking is coming from. I realize how lucky I am to have the support of my family and friends. Even though I am a little depressed because of what has happened, I need to get over it.”

The two women started talking about other things for a few minutes before Daisy asked Lisa if she would get her a glass of ice water.

Lisa brought her mother the glass of water and then removed the bandages from Daisy’s arm and gently cleaned it. Daisy tried to keep still while Lisa was cleaning her arm, but she couldn’t help herself; she started crying all over again. Lisa rushed out of the room to get her mother a wet towel so she could dry her eyes.

When Lisa returned, she found that Daisy had drifted off to sleep while she was cleaning the wound. Although Daisy was resting comfortably, Lisa felt that she needed to check on her before she went back out to the kitchen to get some more ice water.

Lisa gently shook her mother’s hand. “Are you sleeping, Mom?” she asked in a soft voice.

Daisy took a deep breath before she answered Lisa. “I just feel like I’m hanging by a thread. I’m not sure if I can make it through this, Lisa,” she said as tears began rolling down her face again.

Lisa grabbed another towel and tried to dry some of the tears off of Daisy’s face. She waited for a few minutes and then asked her mother, “Why don’t you close your eyes and get some rest. I’ll be back in a little while with more ice water.”

Daisy nodded her head and closed her eyes. Lisa walked out of the room and got more ice water from the kitchen. After she filled the glass, she carried it back to her mother. Lisa then put on a new sponge and cleaned her mother’s wounds again.

After Lisa finished cleaning her wounds, Daisy couldn’t help but feel guilty for falling asleep. She took a deep breath and said, “I know that you’ve been doing a great job, Lisa. I can’t thank you enough for everything you have done, but I just don’t think that I can handle any more right now. I’m sorry, Lisa, but please don’t be mad at me?” 

Lisa smiled and rubbed Daisy’s shoulder as she spoke. “I know that you’re tired, Mom. We can take a twenty-minute break, and then I’ll finish washing your wounds again. After that, we should do the cream and bandages again. Then we’ll go to sleep. Does that sound good?”

Daisy nodded her head and replied, “That sounds perfect! Thank you so much, Lisa. You’ve been such a big help through all of this, and I want you to know that I can’t thank you enough!”

Daisy then kissed Lisa on the cheek and said, “I love you, Lisa. I’m really sorry about everything. If it weren’t for you, I would be so lost right now.”

Lisa smiled and squeezed Daisy’s hand as she replied, “I love you too, Mom. You don’t have to apologize to me. Everything that has happened sucked, but we did the best we could do and we won. That’s all that matters! Now let me wash your sores and get you some rest!”

Lisa then finished washing Daisy’s wounds and placed the antiseptic cream on them. She bandaged Daisy up tightly with gauze as she said, “Okay, Mom. Let’s get some rest! I love you.”

Lisa then took Daisy’s arm in her hands and walked toward the bedroom. As they walked through the living room, Mrs. Winters approached them with a concerned look on her face and asked, “Is everything okay?”

Lisa then responded, “Yes, Mrs. Winters. Everything is fine! Mom is resting comfortably now and I just want to make sure that she gets some rest before the next round of chemo.”

Mrs. Winters smiled at Lisa and said, “Thank you, dear! I know that you have been working harder than any of us during all this. I know we all love Daisy a lot, but none of us have put as much energy into taking care of her as you have!”

Lisa smiled and said, “I love my Mom and I just want her to get better!”

Mrs. Winters then said, “I know, dear.",0
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,"suddenly felt tired again. Her anxiety had returned, and she was feeling
   more alone than ever. Suddenly, she heard the front door open, and her heart
   warmed when she saw Kyle walk in. He looked tired, but seemed happy to be
   home. He walked over to her desk and sat down beside her. “Hey,” he said,
   smiling at her. “What’s up?”
   Aimee smiled back at him wearily. “Just work stuff…I hope you don’t mind that
   I called you? I just wanted to let you know that I’m okay. That guy didn’t
   hurt me—he got scared when the cops showed up. But it was scary…and I just felt
   awful afterwards.”
   Kyle put his arm around her and pulled her close to him. “Aimee, listen to me.
   There is absolutely nothing wrong with you, and you have absolutely nothing
   to feel bad about. I’m sorry if I wasn’t there for you when you needed me.
   We can talk more about this later, but right now I just want to be here for
   you. You don’t have to be scared anymore.”
   Aimee felt tears springing up in her eyes. “Thank you,” she said. “I didn’t
   expect you to forgive me so easily. But I never meant to hurt you.”
   “There is nothing to forgive,” he said. “I am not upset with you, and I
   don’t think you did anything wrong. It’s fine; just let it go.”
   “I hope so,” she whispered. “I can’t imagine what kind of relationship could
   survive that kind of betrayal.”
   “I think you will be surprised at the strength of my love for you and the
   strength of your love for me, too. Kyle took Aimee’s hands in his and she felt as though her heart was floating  in space. “It’s going to be okay,” he said, smiling softly at her. “We can do
   this together. I don’t want us to be afraid of being alone anymore.”
   Aimee looked up at Kyle and then down at their clasped hands. She started to cry again; tears running down her cheeks. She didn’t even realize she was crying. There was no anger, no judgement, just calm understanding. “I am so afraid of being alone,” she said. “I can’t seem to connect with anyone. I try, but only one person has ever gotten close to me and that ended in disaster.”
   Kyle looked into Aimee’s eyes and took her chin in his hand, gently turning her head to face him. They were teary, puffy, and red with mascara stains. The tears were rolling down her cheeks now. He stared deep into her eyes and waited for her to look away first, but she didn’t. She stared back at him as though she wanted to know every secret he had ever kept inside himself.  They were silent for a few seconds. The only sound was the patter of water rolling down her cheeks.
   Aimee finally blinked and looked away from Kyle’s eyes, a small smile on her lips. “You don’t have to say it, I know you think the same way. But I just wanted to say it out loud. Thank you for listening.”
   Kyle smiled back and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek before sitting beside her on the sofa. “So how did you end up here in Washington, anyway?” He asked,  trying to change the mood after Aimee’s confession.
   Aimee took a deep, calming breath in through her nose and exhaled slowly. “My parents moved us here when I was a teenager. We lived in Florida before moving up to Washington.”
   Kyle nodded. “I see, were you happy?”
   “No, not particularly.” She said, taking another sip of her wine. She grimaced slightly as she swallowed the last sip and put down the glass on the coffee table. “My parents were",0
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"he had to be careful not to lose any of his stuff in the process, but he managed. He put away everything except for the chicken and some vegetables – those would become his lunch tomorrow. Then he sat down on his bed again and pulled out his laptop, opening up a browser window to go through some job search engines. There was nothing nearby at the moment, but he figured this way it wasn’t as bad as wasting gas driving around town.

As he browsed, Gabriel noticed that the wall clock across the room had stopped suddenly. He frowned, and went to unplug it from its power source when, without warning, the lights in his apartment flickered off and on a couple of times. They grew steadily brighter until they blazed like the sun in his eyes, accompanied by a rumbling noise that sounded like an earthquake was about to happen.

Gabriel blinked at his computer screen for a moment before realizing that nothing had changed on the screen – he wasn’t sure if he’d not noticed the light change or if his eyes had never adjusted to it. Either way, he pushed his laptop aside and walked over to the window, staring out at the street below for a moment.

Now that he’d gotten a good look at the area outside, it wasn’t nearly as surprising as he thought. Though his apartment complex was located on a small street out of view of most of the town, there were tons of lights flashing and people milling about down there, apparently in a panic. Gabriel heard shouting and even saw a few people running on the sidewalk, but he couldn’t tell what they were shouting or why they were running.

The noise from the street gradually grew louder until it sounded like people were yelling right outside Gabriel’s window. He stood up and leaned his head out, only to find that everything was still totally silent outside. He noticed that there were a few more people on the street now – mostly walking about, but one man had stopped in front of a building, his arms flailing wildly as he yelled at someone beyond the man’s view.

Gabriel didn’t have time to puzzle over what was going on before the noises from the street abruptly stopped and he heard a loud thump outside. Curious, Gabriel stepped over to the window again.

A few seconds later, another loud thump sounded. Then another one. Soon after,  a groan sounded from down the street.

Gabriel walked over to his door and peered through the peephole, but all he saw outside was more darkness and flashing lights from passing cars. He turned off the light and walked back toward his bed. Before he sat down, he turned the TV on again.

A few minutes later, Gabriel heard another groan and a faint shout. He got up and opened his door to peek out, but all he saw were people running about in front of Gabriel’s building, some standing in their balconies watching the commotion, and a few people in the middle of the street who appeared to be helping someone up.

Gabriel closed his door and went back to his bed, thinking that at least things seemed to have calmed down.

Then Gabriel heard another groan. This time it came from somewhere down the hall near his door. He sat back up, walked over to the door, and carefully opened it.

Just as he had done before, Gabriel peered out into his hall in search of any signs of movement. Suddenly he heard a voice from behind him say “Hello?”, and when he turned around he saw a tall man who was standing in the doorway of his apartment with a confused look on his face.

"The group must overcome obstacles such as hunger, thirst, and the dangers of the outside world in order to escape.","Johnathan nods his head and replies, “Yeah, I’m starving and I don’t know about you, but I could use a drink.”

Stephanie asks where he would like to go, hoping that it will lead to some sort of conversation between them.

Johnathan doesn’t appear to hear her and instead replies, “I don’t care. Just as long as we can get something to eat and a drink.”

Stephanie nods her head and Johnathan pulls out into the street. He drives for a while, before stopping at a red light.

Stephanie asks, “Where are you taking me?”

Johnathan looks at the road, when the light turns green he answers, “A little place I know of. It has pretty good food.”

Stephanie doesn’t respond; she keeps looking out the window. She wonders where they are going and how long it will be before he tells her. All she knows is that every minute in this car with him is dreadful.

They pull into an empty parking lot and Johnathan parks the car. He turns to Stephanie and says, “We’re here.”

Stephanie replies, “I can see that.”

Johnathan looks at her and asks, “You don’t like it?”

Stephanie shakes her head. Johnathan gets out of the car and opens the passenger side door for Stephanie, who remains seated.

Johnathan says, “I don’t understand what your problem is. I’m trying to be hospitable and you act like I’ve betrayed you.” He looks at Stephanie, waiting for her to respond.

She holds her hands in front of herself, rubbing them together as if they are cold and she is warming them. She says, “I’m not sure what I did to offend you. All I did was ask for some information. That’s normal for people who care about each other, right?”

Johnathan replies, “Look, all I’m trying to do is be nice, and you won’t let me. I can’t believe that you don ’t trust me.”

Stephanie says, “Trust has to be earned, Johnathan. You haven’t given me any reason to trust you. My family trusts each other because we all believe in the same things. We have faith and we know that we are looking out for one another.”

Johnathan says, “I have faith too.”

Stephanie says, “I highly doubt it. You are a Christian in name only. You don’t hold any of the values that real Christians hold dear. If you really believed in God, you wouldn’t be sleeping with women you barely know. That is a gross sin in the eyes of a true Christian.”

Johnathan says, “You don’t know anything about me. What am I supposed to do? I am not into being celibate my whole life.”

Stephanie says, “The Bible clearly states that sex is only to be had between a married man and woman. You seem to have very little respect for the Bible, Johnathan.”

Johnathan says, “I might believe the things that you believe, but I am not like you. I have a lot of fun and have sex with beautiful women. I enjoy my life and do whatever I want. My morality is different from yours.”

Stephanie says, “How dare you speak about my morality? My family is very Christian and moral. You have no right to judge me.”

Johnathan says, “I believe in God, so I am a ‘real Christian’. I don’t judge you because I am not perfect either. Those who are perfect cast the first stone, right? Wait… Where is your Bible now? I can’t see it, but I thought all Christians carried their Bibles at all times.”

Stephanie says, “The Bible says that only married man and women can have sex. That means that you should only be having sex with your wife. How dare you try to call me out for my beliefs when you are not even a Christian? You are blaspheming God!”

Johnathan says, “I have respect for your beliefs, but I don’t feel like having a discussion about religion right now. I think it is time for you  to shut up and listen to me.”

Stephanie says, “How rude! I am not going to listen to you anymore! I am going home.”

Johnathan says, “Fine then, go home. This car does not belong to you anyway because we are in a post-apocalyptic situation. I have just as much right to it as you do since we are both survivors. I will use the car to drive back to the safe house by myself, thank you very much.”

Stephanie is outraged by Johnathan’s arrogance and lack of respect. She grabs her pink suitcase and throws it out of the car window. She starts to walk away, but she accidentally kicks a rock that almost hits Johnathan in the head. He gets a little cut on his head from the sharp rock.

Stephanie says, “I am done with you! I am just going to walk home.”

Stephanie walks away while Johnathan yells at her, “You are a complete wacko! I don’t know why I ever wasted my time on you! Have a nice trip home by yourself because if you try to come back here, the other survivors will not let you in.”

Stephanie walks for about 30 minutes before she realizes that Johnathan was right. This is a post-apocalyptic situation, and she needs all of the friends she can get. She does not want to be seen as an outsider. She would rather be in the safe house where people are at least friendly and have food. She also realizes that she is hungry and thirsty, and will have to learn how travel without the use of a car for awhile. The biggest problem is that she is lost, so she starts walking in random directions.

She walks for about an hour when she comes across some abandoned houses. There are holes in the walls and floors, and broken windows. Nothing is inside them anymore, except for some cobwebs and dust. She walks around the houses searching for a sign of life, but the only thing she finds is a  bottle of water sitting on the floor of one of the rooms. She picks it up and drinks from it, hoping that it will quench her thirst.

She continues walking through the neighborhood, but still does not find any signs of life. In fact, she finds nothing but more abandoned houses and empty lots. The silence of the neighborhood is eerie. She begins to get worried, wondering whether or not she will be able to find a place to stay for the night. She could always go into another abandoned house, but she has no idea how safe they are.

Suddenly, she hears a sound coming from the left side of the road. She looks in that direction and sees a small car parked on the shoulder. There is a woman sitting in the driver’s seat with her arms crossed and her head resting against the steering wheel. She has long brown hair and green eyes, and is wearing a bright red shirt with blue jeans. She is looking straight ahead, but her eyes are closed.

Stephanie thinks for a moment, then decides to approach the car. Perhaps she can find some information about the neighborhood from this woman, or maybe even some help. She walks towards the car and reaches out to open the passenger door, but suddenly the woman opens her eyes.

“Hello!” Stephanie says. “Do you have any idea where I am?”

The woman jumps in her seat and looks at her with wide eyes. “Whoa! What are you doing?” she says.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you,” Stephanie replies. “I was just wondering if you know where I am. I’m new in town and I can’t seem to find my way around very well. Do you know where the nearest grocery store is?”

The woman shakes her head. “Sorry, I don’t know where anything is, really. Why don’t you come with me? I have some people staying with me at the moment, and they could help you out.”

Stephanie thinks for a moment. The safest thing to do would be to walk back the way she came and try again tomorrow, but she is very tired and hungry. She decides that this is probably her best chance of getting home safely, so she gets in the car.

“Thank you so much for your help,” Stephanie says.

“No problem,” the woman replies. “I’m Willow, by the way. What’s your name?”

“Stephanie.",0
Daisy ultimately beats cancer and her story inspires hope in her community.,"little signs of it coming back. I think that you just have to always live your life knowing that one day it could come back.”

Daisy nodded and said, “I know, honey. I guess I was just feeling sorry for myself for a minute.” She smiled at her daughter and said, “You have been a wonderful daughter through all of this. I don’t know what I would do without you.”

Lisa smiled and said, “I love you, too, Mom.” After a moment she said, “Has anyone ever told you that you have a very soothing voice?”

Daisy blinked in surprise. “Really? I think that it carries sometimes when I don’t want it to, but soothing? That’s really nice to hear. Where did you learn to be so comforting?”

Lisa shrugged her shoulders and said, “I just know what I would want if it were me so I try to do the same thing for everyone else. As far as your voice is concerned, it just seems like the right thing to say sometimes.”

Daisy sat up on her side of the bed and said, “Well, thank you. I think that I will start practicing my soothing voice this afternoon.”

Lisa laughed and said, “You should!” She looked at her watch and said, “Well, I have a few minutes before I have to be at work, so why don’t you tell me what is really bothering you.”

Daisy nodded and said, “Well, my surgery was yesterday and I still don’t feel any better. I mean, I know that I will eventually, but it doesn’t seem like it should be taking this long. And now they tell me that the surgery was more complicated than they thought, and it is going to take much longer for me to recover. It just makes me so angry because I felt fine before the surgery and now I don’t. I know that they did what they thought was right, but why didn’t they know it would be so hard on me?”

Lisa smiled at her mother and said, “I think I can guess the only answer to that question. But you know what the real problem  is with thinking like that? We are not going to get anywhere unless we try to accept what has happened and focus on how we feel about it.”

Daisy said, “I just want my life back. I want to be able to go and do what I want, when I want. I want to go back to my house and live there again instead of in a hospital.”

Lisa nodded and said, “Well, at least we got you here, where they can take good care of you.”

Daisy felt a strong desire to cry that seemed like it would shake her to pieces, but she had been through so much already and she knew that it would waste time.

Lisa said, “You know what I think the problem is?”

“What?” Daisy asked.

Lisa looked Daisy right in the eyes and said, “You just can’t accept that even though you have faced a great deal of adversity in your life, like me, it was nothing compared to what you have gone through in the last few days. You got a broken arm or had to wear a cast on your leg and you learned how to do things differently until it healed, but you have never faced anything that caused you to wonder if you would ever get better. You have never faced the possibility of death and maybe that makes it harder to accept this situation.”

Daisy said, “I told myself over and over before we even got here that I was going to die, but it hasn’t sunk in yet. I remember when you broke your wrist and you were depressed for weeks. I didn’t think I would ever get you out of that state because you couldn’t accept what happened to your arm and it was hard for you to adjust. But, you did accept it and got through it.”

Lisa said, “But, I really had no choice; I had to use my arm in some way or other even though I was depressed. You can’t do that right now; we have taken away your ability to do the things you normally would do.”

Daisy said, “That is true, but I don’t know why I keep getting all worked up over this. I used to be able to deal with things and see the positive side of things. I don’t know where all  this negative thinking is coming from. I realize how lucky I am to have the support of my family and friends. Even though I am a little depressed because of what has happened, I need to get over it.”

The two women started talking about other things for a few minutes before Daisy asked Lisa if she would get her a glass of ice water.

Lisa brought her mother the glass of water and then removed the bandages from Daisy’s arm and gently cleaned it. Daisy tried to keep still while Lisa was cleaning her arm, but she couldn’t help herself; she started crying all over again. Lisa rushed out of the room to get her mother a wet towel so she could dry her eyes.

When Lisa returned, she found that Daisy had drifted off to sleep while she was cleaning the wound. Although Daisy was resting comfortably, Lisa felt that she needed to check on her before she went back out to the kitchen to get some more ice water.

Lisa gently shook her mother’s hand. “Are you sleeping, Mom?” she asked in a soft voice.

Daisy took a deep breath before she answered Lisa. “I just feel like I’m hanging by a thread. I’m not sure if I can make it through this, Lisa,” she said as tears began rolling down her face again.

Lisa grabbed another towel and tried to dry some of the tears off of Daisy’s face. She waited for a few minutes and then asked her mother, “Why don’t you close your eyes and get some rest. I’ll be back in a little while with more ice water.”

Daisy nodded her head and closed her eyes. Lisa walked out of the room and got more ice water from the kitchen. After she filled the glass, she carried it back to her mother. Lisa then put on a new sponge and cleaned her mother’s wounds again.

After Lisa finished cleaning her wounds, Daisy couldn’t help but feel guilty for falling asleep. She took a deep breath and said, “I know that you’ve been doing a great job, Lisa. I can’t thank you enough for everything you have done, but I just don’t think that I can handle any more right now. I’m sorry, Lisa, but please don’t be mad at me?” 

Lisa smiled and rubbed Daisy’s shoulder as she spoke. “I know that you’re tired, Mom. We can take a twenty-minute break, and then I’ll finish washing your wounds again. After that, we should do the cream and bandages again. Then we’ll go to sleep. Does that sound good?”

Daisy nodded her head and replied, “That sounds perfect! Thank you so much, Lisa. You’ve been such a big help through all of this, and I want you to know that I can’t thank you enough!”

Daisy then kissed Lisa on the cheek and said, “I love you, Lisa. I’m really sorry about everything. If it weren’t for you, I would be so lost right now.”

Lisa smiled and squeezed Daisy’s hand as she replied, “I love you too, Mom. You don’t have to apologize to me. Everything that has happened sucked, but we did the best we could do and we won. That’s all that matters! Now let me wash your sores and get you some rest!”

Lisa then finished washing Daisy’s wounds and placed the antiseptic cream on them. She bandaged Daisy up tightly with gauze as she said, “Okay, Mom. Let’s get some rest! I love you.”

Lisa then took Daisy’s arm in her hands and walked toward the bedroom. As they walked through the living room, Mrs. Winters approached them with a concerned look on her face and asked, “Is everything okay?”

Lisa then responded, “Yes, Mrs. Winters. Everything is fine! Mom is resting comfortably now and I just want to make sure that she gets some rest before the next round of chemo.”

Mrs. Winters smiled at Lisa and said, “Thank you, dear! I know that you have been working harder than any of us during all this. I know we all love Daisy a lot, but none of us have put as much energy into taking care of her as you have!”

Lisa smiled and said, “I love my Mom and I just want her to get better!”

Mrs. Winters then said, “I know, dear.",0
"Shannon's father, Mike, dies unexpectedly, leaving her determined to follow in his footsteps and become a successful journalist.","Shannon Doyle was in her mid-twenties, and for a brief period of time, she was the owner of a multi-million dollar conglomerate. Her father, Mike Doyle, had been a journalist for over twenty years. He had worked his way up and eventually became the executive editor of his newspaper.

Shannon had always looked up to her father. And he admired her for being so determined to carry on his legacy. She was only twenty-two, but she had already started working on various newspapers, including her father’s. He was very proud of her for that—it was tough field to get into, especially as a woman.

It was the late summer evening in 2016. Shannon’s father had just come home from work, where he had been writing his editorials for the next morning’s newspaper. Shannon sat with him while he ate his dinner and watched television with her. Then, all of a sudden, she started to feel dizzy.

“Dad! I feel weird,” she said. “What’s wrong with me?”

Her father rushed over to her side and helped her up off the couch. They sat down on the floor and  Shannon held up her head as best she could. Mike turned on all of the lights in the house. His daughter looked awful. Her eyes were turning a funny color and her body was shaking uncontrollably.

“Honey, what’s wrong?” Mike asked her, trying his best not  to panic.

“I don’t know! I feel dizzy and I can’t move my body! Please help me!” Shannon pleaded with him.

Mike held onto his daughter to help her stay steady as she continued to shake and tremble. He was frantic with worry for her. He wanted to take her to the hospital, but he didn’t know how to get her there. He tried calling an ambulance, but his call only went unanswered.

Finally, however, after a few minutes of trying everything he could think of, Mike had an idea. His editor lived only a few blocks away. He rushed to his car and drove Shannon there as fast as he could. He hopped out of the car and carried her into the house, trying not to drop her in his haste.

“I need some help over here!” he shouted to a man in the living room.

The man was the editor, Dan. He quickly came to their aid. He carried Shannon to a couch and laid her down on it before calling for an ambulance. He gave her water and held her hand as they waited for it to arrive. She was shaking uncontrollably, so he asked Mike to hold her down so she wouldn’t hurt herself by moving around too much.

Mike did as he was asked and held his daughter in place. Her body quivered and shook as much as it could. She couldn’t stop herself from convulsing long enough to answer the questions the paramedics asked her. After a few minutes, they strapped her into a stretcher and slid her onto the ambulance. “I’ll come with you, Shannon,” Mike said over his shoulder before running to get into the car.

Dan stayed behind. After a while, he sat down on the couch and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. Mike had been in shock, so Dan didn’t want to think about what might have happened if he had been a little bit later in coming home. It was very possible that Shannon would have gotten herself so tired that she would have fallen asleep at the wheel, got into an accident, and possibly killed herself or someone else. The thought scared him, and made him wonder if he would ever be able to forgive himself if anything like that had happened. 

As a tear ran down his cheek, he heard the door open and close. He stood up, wiping the tear away with his forearm. “I’m coming with you, Shannon,” he said.

Mike stopped for a moment to look at her. “No!” she yelled, trying to sit up. “Stop it!”

She looked up and saw Dan sitting in an armchair by the front window. He was staring out into the street, and when she caught his eye, he smiled and pointed to the space next to him. Shannon breathed a sigh of relief. She didn’t know what to do now. She tried to sit up again, but Mike pulled her back down and put his arm across her chest.

“I know it’s hard, sweetie, but you can’t fall asleep right now! The longer you rest, the less of a chance I have of breaking through. Shannon?” he said, trying to snap her out of it. “Shannon!”

He was having trouble keeping his voice low enough that the paramedic wouldn’t hear him. He reached over and gently shook her shoulders. “You’ve got to stop this shaking, Shannon! You’ve got to—”

A nurse entered the room. “Are you okay? Do you need anything else?” she asked, taking a seat on the opposite side of the bed. She looked at Shannon and frowned. “Shannon?”

“I just need someone to stay with me tonight,” Mike said. “Can you give us some privacy?”

The nurse nodded and left, closing the door behind her. Slowly, Mike removed his arm from across Shannon’s chest. He pulled a chair up to the bed and sat down. He shook his head again and looked around for a moment before finding what he was looking for. He pulled out his phone and opened it up. Holding it out to Shannon, he said, “Your phone.”

Shannon glanced at her phone in surprise and grabbed it off the bedside table, quickly unlocking it and scrolling through the message screen.

Mike watched as she read over a few of her messages, then stopped. She looked up at him with a confused expression.  “Huh?”

“Well, if you don’t want to call your mom or dad, I know another person who might help,” he said.

“What are you talking about?” Shannon asked, her confusion quickly turning into exasperation.

“Just take the phone,” Mike said. He quickly typed a new message on the screen and handed it back to her. “She’s the news director for WXNC TV news. There’s a job opening in reporting, and she might be able to help.”

Mike nodded. “She was my boss for years. I trust her.” He stood up and started pacing around the room again, his hands clasped behind his back. “The most important thing right now is to keep you safe and independent from me. I don’t want you to have to depend on me for anything.”

Shannon glanced down at the phone in her hand once more, then looked up at Mike with a skeptical expression. She sighed deeply and quickly typed a short reply, hitting send before she could consider changing her mind.",0
Shannon Daniels loses her mother to cancer and feels alone and lost.,"Shannon Daniels was a young girl who lived in Seattle, Washington. She was eleven years old, and was just starting fifth grade when her mother died of cancer. Her father hadn’t remarried yet, but had told Shannon he would. He said it would happen soon enough. She wasn’t sure how soon “soon enough” was, but she hoped it wouldn’t be for a long time. Her father and uncle hadn’t tried to replace her mother, but they tried to help her keep busy and forget about the things that reminded her of her mother, like ballet lessons. They had been against ballet lessons for a number of years. But today was Friday, and her ballet lessons were on Friday’s. She was at Miss Penny’s house, doing what she always did at this time on Fridays: stretching for her lesson. Her teacher’s name was Miss Penny, even  though she was only in her twenties. She had been teaching Shannon for almost six years now and became one of Shannon’s most trusted friends. She had brown hair to her shoulders and fair skin like a porcelain doll.

Shannon had been through so much in the past few months, but she was still a bright girl. Her father and uncle knew that Shannon would be alright, but they just wanted to make sure that she had enough time with Miss Penny to get her mind off of things. Because her mother hadn’t died three months ago, it felt like an eternity since she was in the hospital with her. It was so strange to think that she was gone now, that she wasn’t going to come home from work one day or call to tell Shannon about her day. But she wasn’t going to do any of that. She was gone forever, and Shannon felt very alone for the first time in her life.

Miss Penny made it through the door, and they started their stretching routine. “How are you feeling today?” Miss Penny asked.

Shannon groaned because she knew what was coming next. Her teacher always asked her how she was feeling on Fridays before they started working out. She hated to answer the question every time, and this Friday was no different. “I’m okay,” Shannon said quietly. The routine started, and she tried not to think about her mother’s death or the way that Miss Penny was looking at her. It was as if Miss Penny knew something about her, but Shannon didn’t want to talk about it. If she brought it up, then Miss Penny would ask more questions, and she didn’t want to think about it anymore.

Miss Penny was very caring and sympathetic, but Shannon didn’t want sympathy. She wanted to move on and forget about the whole thing, and no one understood that except her father. She was afraid that if she told Miss Penny everything, she would start crying again, and all of her friends would have to comfort her instead of going off to play tag or jump rope.

“Shannon,” Miss Penny said after a few minutes of silence. “Do you mind if I say something?”

Shannon swallowed hard and nodded. She didn’t know why this made her so nervous, but she felt sick to her stomach. Why did  this happen? What did she do wrong? Why couldn’t she make things better for her family? She didn’t want to die too, but if her mother was, then why not her too?

Miss Penny sat down on the front edge of the love seat and gently touched Shannon on the shoulder.

“I just want you to know that it’s going to be okay, okay? You just have to go day by day. That’s how I get through bad days and stuff, and you can too. Okay?”

Shannon nodded again and buried her face in her hands. She wished she could go home right now and hug her father like he did every night when she was little, and never let him go. She wanted to fall asleep next to him and pretend everything was alright for just a little while. Her breathing became more rapid and she closed her eyes.

As she was about to fall asleep, something inside of her felt wrong. This wasn’t right; this couldn’t be all there was to the world either. Her eyes opened slowly and she saw the world differently now. The way the  sun shone through the window made it seem like a rainbow was shooting out of it. The way the tree branches swayed made her feel like they were waving at her.

Miss Penny got up and looked at Shannon. She was sitting on the floor with her legs crossed and her hands on her knees. Her head remained bowed, and she didn’t look up. Miss Penny took a deep breath and sat down next to Shannon. “I have something I want to talk to you about,” said Miss Penny softly.

Shannon looked up unsurely, wondering what Miss Penny wanted to say. The look on",0
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"he had to be careful not to lose any of his stuff in the process, but he managed. He put away everything except for the chicken and some vegetables – those would become his lunch tomorrow. Then he sat down on his bed again and pulled out his laptop, opening up a browser window to go through some job search engines. There was nothing nearby at the moment, but he figured this way it wasn’t as bad as wasting gas driving around town.

As he browsed, Gabriel noticed that the wall clock across the room had stopped suddenly. He frowned, and went to unplug it from its power source when, without warning, the lights in his apartment flickered off and on a couple of times. They grew steadily brighter until they blazed like the sun in his eyes, accompanied by a rumbling noise that sounded like an earthquake was about to happen.

Gabriel blinked at his computer screen for a moment before realizing that nothing had changed on the screen – he wasn’t sure if he’d not noticed the light change or if his eyes had never adjusted to it. Either way, he pushed his laptop aside and walked over to the window, staring out at the street below for a moment.

Now that he’d gotten a good look at the area outside, it wasn’t nearly as surprising as he thought. Though his apartment complex was located on a small street out of view of most of the town, there were tons of lights flashing and people milling about down there, apparently in a panic. Gabriel heard shouting and even saw a few people running on the sidewalk, but he couldn’t tell what they were shouting or why they were running.

The noise from the street gradually grew louder until it sounded like people were yelling right outside Gabriel’s window. He stood up and leaned his head out, only to find that everything was still totally silent outside. He noticed that there were a few more people on the street now – mostly walking about, but one man had stopped in front of a building, his arms flailing wildly as he yelled at someone beyond the man’s view.

Gabriel didn’t have time to puzzle over what was going on before the noises from the street abruptly stopped and he heard a loud thump outside. Curious, Gabriel stepped over to the window again.

A few seconds later, another loud thump sounded. Then another one. Soon after,  a groan sounded from down the street.

Gabriel walked over to his door and peered through the peephole, but all he saw outside was more darkness and flashing lights from passing cars. He turned off the light and walked back toward his bed. Before he sat down, he turned the TV on again.

A few minutes later, Gabriel heard another groan and a faint shout. He got up and opened his door to peek out, but all he saw were people running about in front of Gabriel’s building, some standing in their balconies watching the commotion, and a few people in the middle of the street who appeared to be helping someone up.

Gabriel closed his door and went back to his bed, thinking that at least things seemed to have calmed down.

Then Gabriel heard another groan. This time it came from somewhere down the hall near his door. He sat back up, walked over to the door, and carefully opened it.

Just as he had done before, Gabriel peered out into his hall in search of any signs of movement. Suddenly he heard a voice from behind him say “Hello?”, and when he turned around he saw a tall man who was standing in the doorway of his apartment with a confused look on his face.

The tall man looked down the hall to make sure no one was there. Then he came inside, shut the door, and looked around Gabriel’s apartment. The tall man appeared to be in his twenties, with medium-length black hair that fell well below his ears. His skin was a little pale, but not sickly. He held out his hand and introduced himself while still looking around Gabriel’s apartment as if he expected to find something there.

Gabriel shook the man’s hand and introduced himself as well. “I’m Gabriel Martin,” he said. “Nice to meet you. How are you doing?”

The tall man said “I don’t really know yet… I just got here,” and looked around Gabriel’s apartment again. “This is a nice place… How long have you been here?”

Gabriel looked at the man quizzically and said “Just three months.” Then he added “And it isn’t much  of a place, but it’s getting the job done.”

Gabriel noticed some things that were different about the tall man from what he usually saw in men his own age. For one thing, the tall man was obviously very muscular, with big biceps and shoulders, thick triceps, a well-defined chest, abs that showed through his shirt, and a strong pair of legs. The tall man also had facial hair; he was clean-shaven on top of his head but had thick black stubble on the bottom half of his face. His skin was tanned and his eyes were brown.

The tall man nodded in understanding and said “I can see that… Well, it looks like you’ve made yourself right at home here.” Gabriel chuckled and said “Well, I’ve been doing a lot of cleaning and unpacking lately… I’m getting settled into the place. And that girl up there, she helps me out a lot too.”

The tall man nodded again and said “Oh yeah? She sounds pretty nice… What’s her name?” Gabriel smiled and said “Her name is Lina, and she is.” The tall man said “So she lives with you then?” Gabriel answered “Yeah, she does. We met in the neighborhood.”

The tall man seemed to be intrigued by this news. “So how long have you guys been together?” he asked. Gabriel said “We’re not really together… We just kind of hang out once in a while. But I think she’s interested in me. I mean, there was that time when she was crying and I came home and found her like that, and I comforted her. And then she just kissed me… I mean, it didn’t feel like a real kiss or anything. She just did it out of pity, you know? Just a little peck on the lips. But still!”  Gabriel chuckled and said “I didn’t know how to feel about it at first. But I guess now I do like her… not that much, but enough to want to date her.”

The tall man raised his eyebrows and said “You don’t sound too sure about that.” Gabriel blinked and said “I guess I just can’t believe it yet. It feels so weird to have a girlfriend, you know? She’s my first relationship… Ever! And she’s only my second girl, period! I mean, the first girl was a friend of mine, and when I kissed her, it was just for fun. But this… This is different! This is like… A date!” Gabriel grinned and said “And I just can’t believe that she would ever date me! She could get any guy in the city, but she  chose me! I mean, me…! Not that you’d know it from looking at me, but inside, I’m not so great. I have my flaws. And my insecurities. And there’s a lot about me that you don’t know… but she loves me anyway. She accepts me for who I am, and she doesn’t care what the other people say. It’s so weird, but it feels so good! It feels… grown-up!”

The tall man put a hand on Gabriel’s shoulder and said, “Son, that’s love. That’s what you call someone who truly loves you. Love is something special. You can have relationships without love, or sex without love, but when you find someone who cares about you enough to look past your flaws and accept you for who you are… that’s when you know that person is special. Don’t let her go.”

Gabriel laughed, “That’s the funny thing. She already left. I’m alone now! The first time I went out on my own and met someone outside of school, and I lost her before we even started. I really like her, but she doesn’t want to see me anymore. How could she say that? She said she wanted to get to know me more… but then she just walked away!”

The tall man shook his head, “You’ll find somebody else. It always happens like that. There’s a huge pool of women out there. You just need to start looking for the right one. And don’t worry about losing her, because I promise you that you will lose her eventually. Everyone does.”

Gabriel laughed, “Sure they do.”

The tall man smiled too, “I know it sounds hard, but try to think positively. You can’t get down on yourself because you lose someone. All you can do is learn from the experience and move on. But that doesn’t mean I don’t understand where you’re coming from. Believe me, I know what it feels like to want to be with someone who doesn’t want to be with you. It sucks.” 

Gabriel nodded, “Yeah, it does. I just feel…”

The tall man interrupted him, “You feel like you’re growing up, don’t you? You think that this is your first taste of being an adult, and that a girl walking out on you makes you more grown-up. But it doesn’t. We all learn how to lose people when we’re kids. But I promise you that there will be other girls. And this one that just walked away from you isn’t the only one in the world. That’s what love is all about. Finding someone else when she walks away. Until that happens, you’re not an adult yet. Get back to me when you lose your job, and then maybe I’ll consider you a grown-up.”",1
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"Miss Penny’s face caused Shannon to become unsure again.

“I know that your mother has been sick, and I can see the way you are feeling right now. I know it is hard to watch your mother die from this terrible disease. I think it would help if you tried something new,” said Miss Penny.

“Like what?” asked Shannon.

“I was thinking about you and the way that you draw and paint with your friends after school sometimes. I think you should try painting,” said Miss Penny.

Shannon looked up at Miss Penny and bit her lip for a moment. “What about PE?” asked Shannon.

“We can call your mother and tell her that you are sick; however, first I would like to see what kind of a painter you will be. Please let me see your artwork,” said Miss Penny.

Shannon pulled out the stack of her drawings from her backpack and handed them to Miss Penny. “I don’t know if it is any good,” said Shannon.

“Oh no, these are very good, Shannon. Would you mind if I showed your drawings to my daughter? She loves art, and she may be able to give some helpful feedback,” said Miss Penny.

Shannon smiled and nodded her head. “Sure,” said Shannon.

Miss Penny placed the drawings on her desk and then looked at Shannon. “I think that you may be a natural born artist,” said Miss Penny. “Shannon, I would like to give you an art assignment every week from now on. In addition, I would also like for you to join the art club. That way, you can meet other students who share your passion for drawing and painting. Would you like that?”

Shannon smiled brightly and nodded her head yes. “I’d love to, Miss Penny,” said Shannon.

Miss Penny sat on her desk and smiled at Shannon. “You know, my husband is also an artist. He does chalk drawings, and he is a very talented artist. Perhaps you would like to meet him sometime? He has some of his artwork hanging in the small bookstore in town. Maybe you could  go and visit.”

Shannon’s face lit up with excitement, and she nodded her head rapidly. “Yes! Please, Miss Penny! I would love to see his artwork,” said Shannon. “I would be very honored to meet him.”

Miss Penny’s eyes sparkled as she smiled at Shannon. “You may come for lunch tomorrow then, and we can go and visit my husband’s shop together. How does that sound, Shannon?” asked Miss Penny. “Do you have any other friends in your class who are interested in drawing or painting? You’re more than welcome to bring them along with you, too.”

Shannon was still smiling at Miss Penny. “Yes! I think two of them might also be interested in joining the art club,” said Shannon. “But I will ask them and let you know tomorrow, okay?”

Miss Penny nodded her head rapidly. “Wonderful! Looking forward to seeing you all tomorrow then,” said Miss Penny with a smile. But she quickly turned serious again. “I just want you to be careful with this club, Shannon. Don’t let it get out of hand, okay?” said Miss Penny. “I just don’t want you getting into trouble because other students are jealous of your artwork. Do you understand?” asked Miss Penny.

“Yes, Miss Penny,” said Shannon with a nod of her head. “Thank you for letting me join the art club! Just promise me that we can keep it a secret for the time being, okay?” said Shannon. “Missy and Sara would kill me if they found out about this.”

“I promise, Shannon!” said Miss Penny. “This is something that you and I will take care of together. Will now be a good time to talk to your mom?” asked Miss Penny as she handed Shannon a pen and paper.

Shannon looked at the paper and nodded her head, then quickly scribbled her name on the paper as her mom appeared at the doorway.

“Shannon, are you almost done?” said her mom, looking sleepy. “I have to go and be with your uncle  for a while. I really need some sleep, but he wants me to stay here.”

“Mom, dad!” said Shannon excitedly, as she pulled her mom into the room and showed her the paper with her name on it. “I am in the art club! Miss Penny said that I could start right away. She found out that I had some paints and other supplies in my closet, so she had me bring it into class this morning and show everyone what I could do.”

“Oh, honey! That is wonderful news! With your talents, you could really excel at this kind of activity. I am so glad that you got picked for the club,” said Shannon’s mom, as she hugged her daughter.

“Me too, Mom,” said Shannon as she wiped a tear from her face. “Can I keep it a secret for now? I am going to be late if I don’t hurry up.”

Shannon and her mom left the room, and Shannon ran down the stairs to get ready for school. She didn’t have much time, since she was running late already. She quickly pulled out a clean shirt and pulled it on, then ran into the bathroom to brush her long brown hair. She grabbed her backpack and headed out the door.

When Shannon walked into art club, Miss Penny noticed her right away. She said hi and welcomed Shannon to the club. “I am so happy that you could make it today,” said Miss Penny. “And I see that you are already working on your painting!”

Shannon took a deep breath and smiled as she handed Miss Penny her watercolor set and the picture that she had started drawing. “Yeah. I couldn’t wait, and I wanted to show you.”

Miss Penny looked at it for a while and nodded in approval. “I think this has great potential. You are really good with color blending, but remember to keep it simple when you are starting out.”

Shannon nodded and continued to work on her painting, ignoring the chatter around her. She smiled as she thought about how proud she was of her artwork. The painting reminded Shannon of the day that she arrived at the Academy bus station with her mother.

“The painting looks great so far, Shannon ,” said Miss Penny. “Keep up the good work!”

Shannon smiled and kept painting until class was over. When it was time to go home, Shannon gathered her things and walked out with everyone else. She felt excited to go home and work on her painting.",0
"Shannon lands her first major assignment, a feature on the inner city, but quickly discovers that the ugly reality of life in the city is far different from the dream she imagined.","“You do realize that I don’t know anything about reporting, don’t you?” Shannon said. “I mean, it was just something I wanted to do someday. It was just a dream. I can’t believe you really think that—”

“I’ve seen your work, Shannon, and it’s very good. You have a solid understanding of the language, and you have great instincts for what makes a good story. You’re also very persistent and willing to work hard for your stories. You don’t need a lot of experience to learn how to be a reporter. And I’ll help you get any training you need.”

Shannon watched Mike pace the room, his eyebrows furrowed in thought. “And what if I mess up? What will happen to me then?”

Mike shook his head. “That’s not going to happen. It can’t happen. This is your time, Shannon, and I don’t want you wasting it on a dream that doesn’t pay enough for you to eat. You can work at the restaurant until you figure out what you really want to do.”

Shannon thought about what Mike was saying, but she couldn’t shake her anxiety.
Mike looked at her with a look of disappointment. “I know you can do this, Shannon. You’re going to be great at this job, and in a few years, when you make television history and win all the awards, I want you to remember that I was the one who told you you could do it.”

Shannon smiled at Mike, and then turned her attention to the newspaper. She read through all of the classifieds and found a position that she thought might be a good fit. In the back of the newspaper, she found a few ads for local television stations looking for reporters. She picked up the telephone and dialed the number for WXNC TV news.

“Hello, is this WXNC TV news?” Shannon asked when the receptionist answered.

“Yes, we have a potential opening for a reporter if you are interested.” The voice on the other end of the line sounded somewhat familiar. “Can you come by  the station tomorrow and we can talk a little more?”

“Yes, I will come by in the morning.” Shannon hung up the phone and started packing her bag for her trip to the city. When she had finished packing, she looked around at all of her father’s things that she hadn’t bothered to go through in the past few weeks. She opened the top drawer of his dresser and pulled out a small stack of papers. Handwritten on each piece of paper that was folded into quarters with a pen was the name “Shannon.” On the top piece of paper, he had written his telephone number and on the bottom piece he had written her home address. He must have been carrying these pieces of paper with him for a while, she thought as she put them back in the drawer.

The next morning, Shannon drove to downtown and parked her car on the street. She grabbed her camera bag and started walking in the direction of WXNC. As she entered the building, it seemed as if time had seemingly stood still since it was still early in the morning. She walked over to the receptionist and said hello. “Hello, Shannon?”

“Yes. I am here to see Mr. Kincaid regarding the news intern position he mentioned last week?” Shannon smiled at the receptionist, who was watching her intently.

“Alright. Go through those doors and down the hall and then make a left into the next hallway,” the receptionist pointed in the direction Shannon had just come from. “You will find his office on your left.”

Shannon nodded and continued walking in that direction. As she walked, she felt butterflies in her stomach. She was thinking about how much she wanted to be hired as an intern at WXNC and do meaningful work. For the past three years since her father had passed away, she had been living off of his savings and trying to get a job in the journalism field. She never could quite let go of his dream for her of becoming a journalist. She knew that she could do this, even though she was only slightly familiar with the tools of a journalist. She had taken journalism classes in college, but her focus had been on print journalism as opposed to broadcast news.

She walked into Mr. Kincaid’s office and found him standing up facing the window behind  his desk. He was looking at the skyline of uptown Charlotte. He turned around and smiled when he saw her walk into his office.

“Shannon Doyle, I presume?” he said as he came toward her and shook her hand. “Nice to meet you. I am Steven Kincaid. You have a very interesting resume,” he said as he looked over her application. “Your father was Mike Doyle.”

Shannon nodded and told him that she was honored with the compliment.

Mr. Kincaid continued to look through her resume and stated that he was impressed with how well qualified she was for her age.

“So tell me, Shannon, what are your goals?” he asked.

“I would like to become an investigative reporter,” Shannon answered, as he could see on her resume that she had taken a class in reporting and writing investigative stories.

“We have something here that you might be interested in,” he said opening a drawer on his desk and taking out a stack of manila folders. Shannon noticed that each folder had the word “Inner City” written across the top and her heart began to race.

“These are the stories that I wanted you to look at today,” he said as he handed her the stack of folders. “They are all about living in the inner city, which is where you would be living if you took this position with WXNC. Take your time and look through them, but I need to let you know that I have a deadline for the hiring process.”

Shannon thanked him for the opportunity and left his office, walking back towards the reception area. The receptionist was smiling as she watched Shannon walk down the hall. As soon as the doors closed behind Shannon, the receptionist turned to Mr. Kincaid and said, “I told you she was good. You should have seen her eyes light up when you handed her those stacks of stories!”

Mr. Kincaid smiled back at her and said, “Well we’ll see if she can handle them. I have to admit that I was impressed with her background.”

“She seems to have a real passion for wanting to become a journalist, and that will go a long way in helping her get the job,” said the receptionist as she",1

	Lisa giggled and Charles chuckled as she said, “I want a kiss from each of you.”
	Neither one of them hesitated as they leaned over the desk and kissed Lisa on two cheeks…then they looked at each other and said, “Now what about your mother?”
	Andrea blushed as she got up from her chair and walked over to Lisa’s chair and leaned down and gave her a big kiss….then Charles said, “Now you owe me the same thing!”
	They all laughed as Andrea went around the desk to stand beside Charles. They both leaned over and kissed Lisa on both cheeks…then Andrea said, “You are an amazing young woman…I know that you will make me very proud!”
	Lisa stood up and said, “Thank you again for doing this for me…I can’t wait to get started!”
	While Charles walked them to the door, he said, “You two have always been like family to me and I love both of you very much. Just think about everything that we’ve talked about today when you are out there at work and try to remember that your patients have feelings too. They want to feel important, and they want to know that you care about them.”
	Andrea said, “I don’t doubt for a second that you will be a wonderful nurse! I wish that Daisy could have seen this day here in our town hall…she would have been so proud of her little girl! Keep up the good work…tell your mother that we’ll see both of you in a couple of weeks.”
	They waved as they left the building and Charles thought to himself, “It just goes to show you that everybody has a story to tell and each one is different than the next! We all have different personalities, but when it comes down to it…our lives are all connected by a common thread. I hope that Lisa will take our advice today and use it to her best advantage in treating her patients.”
	Within the last hour, Charles had seen two different people who were dealing with challenges in their lives that were just as serious as cancer, but they had found courage inside themselves to deal with them and overcome them. It reminded him how precious life was…just like the song says: “It’s not the breaths we take that show how much we really care…it’s the times that take our breath away…”
	As they walked to their car, Charles told Andrea, “I appreciate your concern for me and Daisy. You know, we have been so lucky in Mayberry over the past couple of years. We’ve just had all of these wonderful experiences and people…I really hope that this wonderful period is not coming to an end anytime soon! We need to cherish each moment of it while we still have it!”
	Andrea smiled and said, “Charles, I can honestly say that our life here has been a blessing for us ever since we moved here from California over thirty years ago. And our reason for moving out here has truly been blessed with everything that we could have ever asked for in a daughter. She is our pride and joy!”
	Lisa came running up to them as they reached their car. She had that same smile from earlier, which told Charles that she was now going to enjoy her new career as a full-fledged doctor. It made him feel proud for her, but it also made him realize that he would soon no longer be able to call her his little girl.
	Lisa jumped into the car next to Charles and said, “Dad, you were awesome! I wasn’t sure if you could give a speech like that but damn…you really inspired me!”
	Andrea smiled at Lisa and said, “Yeah, your father just might have to write more political speeches in the future. It really hit home with the folks in this town today.”
	Lisa turned her head towards Charles and said, “Besides…you don’t have any other career prospects right now. The only thing we have left on the bucket list is to fix Mayberry General Hospital.”
	Andrea said, “That sounds good…but I don’t think that we should wait long after the election. I think we should try to start on it as soon as possible. That way we can get it done in a timely manner and get the results we want during your first year as mayor.”
	Charles said, “That sounds like a great idea…I think that doing this together will be a great way to start our relationship as father and daughter. We should do this together! And we should do it sooner rather than later. I mean…we’re not getting any younger, right?”
	Andrea said, “So…what are you gonna do about work while we’re visiting the Mayberry General Hospital?”
	Lisa said, “Oh, leave that up to me. I have everything handled already. The owner of the hardware store has agreed to hire me back while we do a few hours of volunteer work at the hospital. We can work on my doctoring skills at the same time as we get started on fixing Mayberry General Hospital.”
	Charles said, “Well…we did say that you would be getting job experience while we were working on our bucket list.”
	Andrea said, “What? What about my job?”
	Lisa said, “Oh…your job won’t get in the way of anything your doing. In fact, it may even help keep you healthy while you work towards beating this cancer. Maybe you can assist us in the surgery area or maybe even perform some minor surgeries by yourself. I think that it would be great for your confidence if you operated on a few patients while we’re working on fixing up Mayberry General Hospital.”
	Charles said, “Well…it does make sense. You are a doctor after all.”
	Andrea said, “I suppose you’re right. I would love to help out at the hospital while we’re working on our bucket list.”
	Lisa said, “Great! I think that Daisy Mayberry would be a perfect first patient for you to operate on. She’s been diagnosed with cancer and her family is struggling to pay for her treatment. I know that she would appreciate your help.”

Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,", brushed her teeth, and went over to the bed. Aimee didn’t turn the lights on when she went into her bedroom but she knew that it wouldn’t be a problem finding her way around in the dark since she had been living in this apartment for so long now.

Aimee cuddled up with her pillow and tried to fall asleep but no matter how hard Aimee struggled, sleep was just not coming for her.

Aimee sat up and looked around the room, her eyes stopping on Kyle’s picture sitting on top of the dressing table. She hadn’t known Kyle that long but she liked him. He was a good guy and Aimee hoped that he would come back again soon because she really needed him right now.

Aimee walked over to the dressing table and sat down on top of the chair that was sitting next to it, which allowed Aimee to get a better look at Kyle’s picture.

Aimee gazed at the picture for a while before deciding that she should call Kyle and talk to him again, maybe he had remembered something else that could help Aimee figure out who she was supposed to be with.

Aimee picked up her cell phone and tapped in Kyle’s phone number and waited for him to pick up. She had his number in her phone but she had never actually called him before so Aimee was a bit surprised when Kyle answered on the first ring.

“Hi Kyle, it’s me Aimee.”

Aimee listened as Kyle said hello and told her that he was about to call her because he wanted to know how she was doing.

“I’m fine, I just wanted to talk to you again if it’s okay with you?” she asked.

Kyle told her that of course it was okay with him and that he was happy to hear from her again. He told Aimee that it didn’t matter if they talked about whatever or nothing at all because he enjoyed talking to Aimee and hoped that she would call him whenever she needed someone to talk to.

Aimee thanked Kyle for his support and told him that she would call back tomorrow because right now, she wanted to get some sleep.

Kyle told Aimee “Goodnight” and hung up after telling her that he would talk to her again the next day.

Aimee stood in her living room a few minutes after ending her short chat with Kyle. She was alone, the same way she had been when she was younger. She was lonely and she didn’t think there was anyone who could understand why. She had grown up in a family where being single meant loneliness, and being alone meant that one wasn’t good enough for anything more than solitude. Her parents were married and loved each other but their love had come late in life. Her father had been married several times before meeting her mother, and while he claimed to have loved each of his previous wives, the truth was that he had left them all because he was afraid of being alone.

Aimee had always felt unloved and unwanted, an emotion that she couldn’t shake just because she now lived on her own.

She went into her bedroom and turned off the light before climbing into bed. She rolled over on her side and closed her eyes but the effort to sleep was too great. She tossed and turned for hours but she never fell asleep.

Aimee finally gave up trying to sleep and went into the living room where she sat on the sofa and turned on the television. She flipped through channels but none of them held her attention. Her loneliness and fear of being unloved pressed in on her, suffocating her, making it impossible for her to relax.

She cried silently and fought back tears as she wondered what Kyle would think of her if he knew how alone she was. She wished he had been there that first night when she had come home so that he could have seen how ugly and lonely she felt when she was all alone in her apartment, surrounded by emptiness.

She wished Kyle was there with her right now so that they could share a comforting moment together. She wanted him to hold her and tell her that everything would be all right, but he wasn’t there. He was on the other side of the country with his family, enjoying the holidays with his wife and son.

She called Kyle because she wanted him close to her, even if it meant only talking to him on the phone. But now she found herself wishing he had never called earlier that day, because he would be close enough for her to go see him if she really wanted but instead he was far away and unreachable.

She cried even harder as she realized how much she wanted Kyle to be with her. She wished Kyle was there so that he could take her mind off of everything that was wrong in her life and everything that made her afraid: being alone, being unloved, not being good enough for anyone to love.

Kyle must have known all along that Aimee struggled with these fears. She had often confided in him about them, not knowing that he knew all along what she was really saying, wishing he could love her and make it all better.

But he never did anything about it; at least not in the way Aimee wanted. He always listened sympathetically and offered her reassurance. But nothing ever changed the way she felt. Nothing ever made her feel less lonely or unloved, and nothing ever made her believe that things would be okay in the future.

Aimee wished that Kyle could tell her that everything was going to turn out all right, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t make any promises without knowing how things were going to turn out for himself as well. He might get divorced and his son might grow up and move away from him, leaving him all alone in the world.

Aimee felt bad for wishing that Kyle’s life would",0
Valerie makes it to safety and the police catch John Doe.,"happened and they started looking for John Doe. It did not take long for them to find him, because whenever John Doe was in one of his killing rampages, he left a large amount of evidence behind. Once again, the police caught John Doe and this time they put him in jail where he would stay for good.

--------------------------------

The story ended with these last few sentences: Police officer Jones walked into the room. “Well, I’m glad you decided to come and talk to us again, Valerie.”

Valerie said, “Yes officer Jones, I know exactly what you want to ask me about and I have some interesting information for you.”

Jones said, “We have some evidence that John Doe is the person who killed these women, not you. We also have some evidence that points to someone else as being a possible accomplice of his. And we know for sure that somebody helped him in his killings, because he never could have done it all by himself. And it would be really great if you could help us with this puzzle and give us some more information about what he did and where he did it exactly.”

Valerie said, “Yes officer Jones, I have some new very interesting information for you, but I will tell you only if you help me first.”

Jones said, “You want my help? My partner and I have been working on this case for a long time now, and it would be really helpful if you could tell us something new we don’t know.”

Valerie said, “Yes officer Jones, I have some very interesting new information for you. But first I want you to untie me and let me go. And then I will tell you what John Doe told me, because he told me before he killed the last victim.”

Jones said, “Ok Valerie, we can do that. Do you still want to press charges against John Doe for his other crimes?”

Valerie replied, “No I don’t want to press any charges against him, because I am very grateful for all his help and I want to make sure he is not executed. The only punishment I want for him is that he has to spend the rest of his life in jail. He cannot be allowed to kill innocent people anymore, because there are many other women who need protecting.”

Jones said, “Ok then Valerie, we will let you go. But first give us the address of your house so that we can verify what you are telling us is true.”

Valerie said, “Sure thing officer Jones. Thank you for being so reasonable about this, and thank you for releasing me. So here is my address: 123 Fake Street, Anytown USA.”

Jones said, “I have no reason to believe you are lying about this address, but let me check it in my database anyway. It will only take a minute.”

Jones typed in the address into his computer and then looked up at her and said, “Ok Valerie this is real. Now Valerie tell me what happened so we can solve your case.”

Valerie said, “Ok sir Jones I have some very useful information for you about the John Doe case. I had a lot of time to think about my situation while I was there in that basement, and it really got me thinking about how we treat criminals in our society today. I think we need to start punishing criminals much more harshly for their crimes so that they will not commit them again. Because clearly the current punishments aren’t working.”

Jones said, “In what way are they not working? Are repeat criminals walking free from court every day?”

Valerie said, “No sir but the punishments are not harsh enough for these repeat criminals to deter them from re-offending. You see when you get put behind bars for life or executed, it doesn’t actually stop most people from committing crime. They know that they could easily get caught and put behind bars so they just don’t get caught doing anything bad. The way I see it, the reason repeat offenders keep on going is because they know that the punishments aren’t harsh enough to stop them, but they also know that if they were caught being bad again then it would be a whole different matter because this time around, they wouldn’t get out of jail or be executed at all. They would be put away for life without any chance of parole and they would never ever see the light of day again! So if we want these people to stop committing crime, then we need to make sure that when they are caught committing a crime it is an offense for which they can never ever get out of prison.”

Officer Jones said, “And what does any of this have to do with you? And why are you here Valerie from the UK?”

Valerie said, “It does have a lot to do with me officer. The reason I’m here is because I was supposed to die today. You see I used to be a girl, but now I’m not. A few days ago, it was my best friend who was meant to die in this basement, but she didn’t because some man with a knife came and saved her and took me instead. He said he wanted somebody from this country and that is why he took me instead of her. The police came later and rescued us both from the hotel room that the man had locked us in. Once they had me up here in your interrogation room I started talking about how unfair it was that there is a two-tier justice system in this country where rich people are allowed to get off with lesser crimes than normal people. And also how unfair it was that if you are rich enough you can just buy yourself out of punishment altogether, like what happened recently in the banking industry, where all the bankers were caught doing those really bad things, but instead of being punished, they were just given loads of money to leave. And I said that it wasn’t fair and that something needed to be done about it, and then I was brought down here to this room.”

The officer looked at her for a moment and then said, “You’re lucky that you’re alive. If John Doe had got his hands on you, you would be dead now. We managed to catch him before he could do anything to you. He’s in custody and he will be going to prison for a very long time.",1
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"however, there was an old dilapidated swing-set that had seen better days. He walked back over to his phone and dialed Jeremy’s number.
 Jeremy answered after two rings. “Hey man, what’s up?”
 “I can see you right now. Can you see me?” Gabriel asked as he peeked around the corner of his apartment.
 Jeremy laughed on the other end of the line, “Of course. We can see everything through these windows and doors. You can see us, we can see you, and we can even smell what you are cooking for dinner every now and then.”
 “How is it there?”
 “It’s great man, we are loving it. We threw a big barbecue over there last night to welcome ourselves to the neighborhood,” Jeremy said as he laughed heartily at his own joke. “See you later man, gotta run. I have a meeting in fifteen minutes and I’m already late as it is. Talk to you later man, bye!”
 “Bye Jeremy!” Gabriel said as he put his phone down and walked over to the kitchen. He grabbed two plates and cutlery sets before walking back into his room and calling out to Julio.
 “Dinner is ready!” he called out.
 Julio was sitting on the couch reading a brand-new copy of Gabriel García Márquez’s 100 Years of Solitude when Gabriel entered the room. He closed his book and stood up before smiling at Gabriel as he sat down on the couch next to him.
 “Thank you son,” Julio said as he patted Gabriel’s hand. “I am very hungry, what did you cook for us?”
 “Pasta with meatballs and a side of garlic bread,” Gabriel said as he walked toward the kitchen and served himself before returning to sit down next to his father. “So, how are you settling in? You haven’t been out of the apartment much since moving in yesterday.”
 “It is going very well and I am very happy here. I have been sleeping quite comfortably for the most part, although I did not like having to sleep alone last night,” Julio said as he started eating his portion of pasta.
 “You can sleep with me tonight if you like, Dad.”
 “No thank you. That is not a problem for me,” Julio said as he took another forkful of pasta in his mouth and began chewing it slowly. “I have missed being able to talk so much with you over the last few years, Gabriel. It seems so strange to finally be able to do that again and about whatever we choose to discuss.”
 “I have missed it too, Dad, I really have,” Gabriel said before he began eating the pasta on his own plate. “So tell me what is going on in your life at the moment; I haven’t heard much from you since I got here.”
After a pause, Julio answered him. “Well, for one thing my acting career has taken off in the past two years since your mother and brother left me. I have been offered a lot of work over that period, both in film and on the stage.”
As he ate his pasta, Gabriel listened intently to everything that Julio was saying to him about his acting career. He could not help but wonder what had motivated his father to ask him to help him move into the apartment so that he could be closer to his daughter and grandchild.
“I am also directing one of the plays myself as well,” Julio continued, “called The Merchant of Venice. You will probably recall that it is the famous story about Shylock who wants a pound of flesh if he doesn’t get his money back from Antonio; it is a role I am very excited to be playing. I have made some wonderful contacts in the theater in Los Angeles and I am hoping that some of them will allow me to direct other plays for them soon.”
Julio then told Gabriel about a couple of other theater projects that he was involved in at the moment, as well as some films and TV programs that were being shot in South America. Even though Julio had been an actor for many years, it still seemed incredible to Gabriel that he was now directing one of the greatest plays ever written in history.
“It is very exciting for me Gabriel, it really is. I know that you are very excited too; your mother and I have always wanted you to become a writer too when you grew up,” Julio said. He was beginning to get concerned about having his son moving away from home and decided that it would be a good idea for him to spend some time with him before he left.
“I am sure that we can have a great time together, can’t we?” Julio asked.
Gabriel thought about this for a while and realized that he was actually looking forward to spending time with his father. At the same time, he didn’t want to neglect his new opportunities either.
“I suppose so, but there are some things that I have to do too, like get some furniture and other things for the apartment. There is a furniture store close to your apartment building, so I will probably go over there tomorrow afternoon,” Gabriel told Julio.
“I am sure that you can do whatever you want during the day, but I will be busy with rehearsals all day until 7:00 at night,” Julio explained.
“Is there not another time when we can arrange to meet up that will suit both of us? I don’t want us to miss out on time together because of scheduling conflicts,” Gabriel said.
He was hoping that Julio would agree to some other time, so that he and Rich could see each other as well. He didn’t think that he had spoken to his friend for a few days now.
“Well, I suppose we can meet up tomorrow evening after my rehearsal. I will come over to your apartment at around 8:00 and we can go out for dinner or something,” Julio said.
“That sounds great, I will see you tomorrow then,” Gabriel said as he got up to leave.
He was glad that they had been able to work something out and he was looking forward to spending some time with his father.",0
The group of survivors must face the enemy and defeat him in order to survive in this new world.,"“We can’t just stay here; we have to do something,” said another spirit.

At that moment, another creature appeared in front of them standing on its hind legs like a human. This new creature was much smaller than the green one and his fur was brown instead of green. He also didn’t have fangs or claws and he had a friendly smile on his face. The group of spirits stared at the beast in awe before they ran over to him. The small animal looked up at them and smiled.

“Who are you? What are you doing here?” asked one of the spirits in a childlike voice as he ran up to the animal and hugged him.

The other spirits went up to the beast and petted him and scratched his chin. The stranger laughed a bit before saying, “I’m Ratzinger Kugelman and I live here too. I just came to see what all the activity was about. Is there a problem here?”

“Yes! There is a monster on the loose and it keeps chasing us! We can’t seem to get away from him! We need your help to stop him,” said one of the spirits as he took a step back from the small animal.

“Well, I think we need to be very careful. This must be a test of some sort. He could be after you for something, but for now, let me take care of him so you can all get back home safely. I’ve been waiting for an opportunity to meet you anyway, but we must all stick together now more than ever!”

“Yes. We have to stick together and not let monsters like that win!” said another spirit.

The spirits began walking with the stranger Ratzinger Kugelman as he led them over to the large rock in the middle of the stream. When they reached it, he crouched down and looked into a small hole between two rocks. Slowly, he moved his head up and peeked out at them. “He’s still there. I think if we all jump up on this rock now, then he won’t be able to reach us since we are so high up above the water. Do you all think you can manage hopping up on this rock? Then I’ll lead you home, but first we must all yell in unison. This is very important. When he hears this mysterious sound, he will no longer be able to find us!”

“Okay, we’re ready!” said one spirit.

They all climbed up onto the rock. Ratzinger Kugelman looked at them for a moment then faced the cave from which the monster emerged. Then he started to shout into the cave as loud as he could, “WURRRRRKKKK!” He shouted it several times with more and more force each time until all his energy was spent. As soon as he stopped, there was a loud rumble that shook the entire earth under their feet and they were all flung through the air into the water below. They landed in shallow water and coughed up water for a few moments until they could catch their breath.

After wiping their faces off, they looked at one another and said in unison, “Wurrrrkkk!”

The ground shook again with a powerful blast and they were all thrown into the air and into the bushes around them. They landed on their backs and rolled back over onto their stomachs with their hands covering their heads, only to be knocked unconscious by a third blast.

They all woke up in the same position, all covered with leaves, sticks and dirt. They looked around to make sure they were all there then started searching for Ratzinger Kugelman. They soon found him lying motionless on his back in the middle of a clearing. One of them walked over to him and examined his body to make sure he was dead. He was not moving, nor was he breathing. Then the other spirits joined them and they all sat around him in silence as they pondered what had just happened.

Finally, one of the spirits stood up and said, “He must have been telling the truth about the cave.”

Another spirit questioned, “What do you mean?”

The first spirit responded, “He must have gotten rid of the monster that way before we made him show us how it was done.”

“Well, he probably did it in a different way because we didn’t hear anything like that coming from him as he did it,” said another spirit.

The first spirit replied, “It doesn’t matter how he did it; the fact is that once again he saved our lives.”

Another spirit asked, “Then why did he let us get captured again?”

The other spirits looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders. They did not know why Ratzinger Kugelman had done what he had done but thanked him nonetheless for his generosity. Then they walked back to the cave and gathered all their things so they could continue their journey upriver. Again they were making good progress despite the dense vegetation and treacherous rocks. They had just passed a waterfall and were climbing a steep path when they heard a yell in front of them. They stopped to see what was going on when suddenly, from up the rocky embankment, Ratzinger Kugelman popped out and shouted, “Quick! Get behind me so you won’t be seen.”

They all quickly ran up to him, and just as they started looking out, they heard a loud roar coming from the bushes. When the roar was over they all looked around in disbelief then questioned him about what had just happened. He told them he had heard something moving in those bushes and suspected it may have been the monster following them. He told them to climb up higher where they would be safe from the roars and could see better.",0
"Shannon lands her first major assignment, a feature on the inner city, but quickly discovers that the ugly reality of life in the city is far different from the dream she imagined.",", she wasn’t sure if she could be as good as them.

Shannon was also worried about her future because of the economy. Her father’s newspaper was in financial trouble, and she was sure that it would soon close. He had been trying to find investors to buy the paper for a while now, but was having no luck. It was very upsetting to her that his efforts seemed so futile.

She didn’t know what she would do if the newspaper closed because she had never thought about going to another newspaper or working for another company. She wondered if there were many jobs available in her field, which was writing. She also didn’t know if she wanted to leave the house and find a job somewhere else. Since she had finished high school, it had been hard for her to stay away from home.

The only time she felt comfortable leaving the house was when she was going to work with her father on his newspaper at night or during the weekend and sometimes for lunches and dinners too. She really liked being on the newspaper staff because that was the only place where she could be around other people and hear about how they were feeling or what was happening in their lives. Sometimes she thought that the people who worked for her dad were more of her friends than the people who she talked to at school or in her neighborhood or anyone else she knew.

Shannon was still amazed at how lucky she was to have gotten a job with her father. She had tried many jobs when she was younger, including being a cashier at the grocery store, but nothing seemed right until she got her job with the newspaper. The work at the newspaper was very different from anything else she had ever done before because it gave her so much freedom to do what she wanted and say what she wanted. Plus, the people on the newspaper staff were very cool and were always doing fun things with each other and they always took her along with them when they did these things.

When Shannon got to school, she sat down at her desk in the computer lab and opened her email to see if anything had come in that might interest her for a news story. Before they started working on their projects, Ms. Walker told them that they would not have time to check their email when they got home, so she wanted them all to check it before class started.

There was one email from someone who had been referred to Shannon by her school counselor who said that he had written an article about the drug dealers in his neighborhood. He asked if Shannon would be interested in writing a story about them too. She was very interested, so she emailed him back and asked if he could send it to her at school because she did not have a computer at home. He said that he would be glad to, so Shannon waited for him after school so that he could bring his article to her. She didn’t know what his story was about, but she knew it was a good idea because the drug dealers in her own neighborhood were out of control.

Soon, this boy was standing in front of the computer lab door waiting for Shannon to let him in. He had long hair and a mustache and was wearing an Army style jacket with patches all over it. Even though he looked kind of scary, Shannon knew that he wouldn’t do anything bad to her because her dad was the editor of the paper and he would never do anything to harm any of them. He came into the computer lab and introduced himself as Gary Saunders, Jr. His parents owned a convenience store in their neighborhood and they also sold cigarettes out of it. Gary told Shannon that the drug dealers were driving local businesses like his parents’ store out of business and that he wanted to do something about it.

Shannon was very impressed with Gary because he was only in seventh grade but he was already doing something to change things in his own community. She couldn’t even imagine being old enough to go out into the community and try to make a difference, so she asked him how old he was. He said that he was thirteen which meant that she was two years older than him. She told him that she would love to write about what he was doing and that they should meet up once she finished her story for the newspaper so that he could tell her more about how he wanted things in his neighborhood to change.

In the meantime, Shannon wanted to get more information on how the drug dealers were destroying things in their neighborhood. Her dad usually didn’t go to these kinds of meetings, but he agreed to take her to one and Shannon was very excited about this opportunity. They asked one of the reporters on staff if they could ride along with him because they really didn’t have time to go on their own, so he kindly agreed to take them with him. When they arrived at the meeting, Shannon was surprised to see that it had already started and everyone was waiting for them. The reporters were told that they could sit in the back and Shannon was glad because she didn’t want to be in the way. As she watched everyone talk about their concerns, she couldn’t help but overhear some of what was being said. One of the men who seemed to be speaking for the group made sure that everyone knew that he didn’t mean any harm towards anyone - he just wanted to protect his family and community from drugs. He went on to say that before drugs came around, his family didn’t have a problem with gangs or violence. Everyone was polite and kept their promises. The gangs sold drugs mostly in their neighborhood, but also in some of the other neighborhoods around them. Now they are too scared to step outside their homes even during the day. He ended by saying that he loves his neighbors but a lot of them are just afraid right now and that they know it’s not going to get better if they don’t do something about it now.

Shannon was very impressed with this man’s ability to speak up for his neighbors and she wondered why no one else had said anything yet. As soon as the meeting ended, she took some notes and then went over to talk to him and",0
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"mom said that Shannon’s dad made enough money to have a lot of extra stuff that he wanted, but Shannon didn’t know what that meant.

Shannon’s mom didn’t have a big job, but she did have a big smile. She smiled all the time when she was at home, which was pretty much all the time since Shannon’s dad made sure they spent a lot of time together.

Shannon started to miss her mom right away after she died and she started to wish that her mom could come back. Shannon knew this was impossible ‘cause her mom was at a funeral home now in a box and they couldn’t open the box because it would make the people there sad. So Shannon just kept wishing that her mom would come back to be with them for real, but she knew it wasn’t going to happen no matter how much she wished.

Shannon didn’t know exactly what she wanted, but when she was at home and nobody else was around she sometimes played hide-and-seek by herself in the basement so it felt like her mom could see her without being able to see anybody else. She liked hiding down there because it was dark and Shannon thought it was funny how she could go all the way downstairs and hide in the corner behind her dad’s old boxes of slides from his college days, but sometimes he would come downstairs before she had a chance to hide and Shannon didn’t know what to do. She would try hiding between the couch cushions every time, but she could never find one that was deep enough so her dad couldn’t see her hands. Sometimes he would even look under the couch, but she thought that was just dumb because if he really wanted to see who was under the couch he could just get on his knees and look. But usually Shannon wouldn’t peek out from behind the couch until she heard her dad close the door to his studio and then maybe she would go out into the kitchen pretending to need some cream for her coffee, or maybe she’d make herself a sandwich in the fridge or something.

She didn’t even try hiding upstairs anymore, because now that she didn’t have her mom around it seemed a lot lonelier upstairs than downstairs. Shannon didn’t really tell anybody about how she felt because she didn’t want them to think she was a baby who couldn’t get over her mom’s death. What Shannon didn’t understand was why she still missed her mom so much. It seemed to her like everyone else had been able to move on but her, even though it had been almost a whole year since she passed away.

Shannon thought about this a lot, especially after her friend Emily moved away and Emily even said that she still cried at night sometimes but that at least now when she cried it was just for fun, which Shannon thought sounded really weird. It wasn’t that Shannon didn’t want to be able to smile again, actually she did, but before she could smile again she wanted people to understand how much it hurt her that her mom wasn’t with her anymore.

Shannon didn’t cry very often, but when she did it was usually at night in her bed, or on the days when she had nothing better to do and so had no distractions. Usually she would just go up into her attic and try painting some of those pictures in her head. But Shannon knew that painting wasn’t going to be enough to help her, and so she tried getting out of the house more, but it wasn’t easy for her.

Shannon wasn’t a very popular girl, and even though she was in seventh grade, she never had a boyfriend. She had plenty of friends and people to talk to at school, but at the end of the day they all just drifted off in their own directions and she was left all on her own again.

Shannon decided that maybe there was something wrong with her after all. Maybe there was something about her that other people didn’t like or maybe it was just because she had an accent. She couldn’t be sure, but she knew that what ever it was, people didn’t seem to want to get close to her. So Shannon decided that it was pointless to try and be more friendly towards other people, because if they didn’t want to talk to her then there was nothing she could do about that.

But even though Shannon didn’t like being on her own all the time, she did get used to it after a while and got used to the silence in the house too. It made her feel like she was in a bubble where all the sounds around her were muffled and dimmed by a thick sheet of cotton. She would sit on the stairs leading up to the attic and look at her bedroom door, longing for someone to come in. Her bedroom was like a little sanctuary, where no one could disturb her or intrude on her private thoughts.

Shannon then started going through the attic where she had kept all of her old toys and drawings and things from when she was very young. She found old drawings that she had done when she was about ten years old, but even though they were just what any other ten-year-old would have done, they still seemed magical and full of a child’s wonder to her.

When Shannon first started going through the boxes in the attic, she had done it because she thought it would cheer her up, make her feel young again. But then as she kept going through box after box that had been stored in the attic for years and years, for some reason all the old things she had found inside of them started to seem very important to her. She wanted not only to look at them but also to hold them in her hands and stare at them for ages as if she were looking at something very precious.

“I miss you, mom,” she whispered to herself as she held a blanket that she had loved when she was little.",0

"The group must overcome obstacles such as hunger, thirst, and the dangers of the outside world in order to escape.","collecting between his head and the floor, and Jennifer Lopez felt sick at the sight.

    “What did you do?” she asked once again, shaking her head in disbelief.

    “He tried to escape,” one of the men explained, “We caught him heading towards the door. We had to tie him up before he hurt somebody or got away!”

    “But why?” Jennifer Lopez asked, still refusing to believe them, “Why would you do that? We don’t have anything we need here- we can find food and water easily outside!”

    “No, you’re wrong,” one of them explained, “The people outside are just like us. They don’t know what is going on or where they should go. Everybody is confused and scared right now. You can see the effects it has had- all of the food has been taken from our houses because everyone is so hungry. Everything that can be used has been used, and now there isn’t anything left. It doesn’t matter if we stay here or go outside- we will both die if we don’t get help soon.”

    The two men stared at her for a moment before nodding in agreement. They then approached Jesse Burgess who had been tied to the chair. They untied him, and he stood up, rubbing his wrists awkwardly.

    “Thanks,” he said sarcastically as he rubbed his wrists, “I didn’t need that.”

    Both men walked towards the back door in silence, leaving only Jennifer Lopez and Jesse Burgess in the kitchen. She stood there still rubbing her eyes and shaking her head as she watched them walk away. She wished that she could believe what they had said. But it was simply too hard to trust anyone anymore- especially someone who had been a terrible person for as long as Jesse Burgess had been.

    Suddenly she felt her body being shoved back by Jesse Burgess with surprising strength. She fell onto the floor, and he stood over her, staring down at her with his ugly face and cold eyes.

    “You don’t trust me?” he asked in a threatening voice, “Well, you should have thought of that before you said I wasn’t welcome here. What, do you think you can just kick someone out of their home whenever you feel like it?”

    She tried to make herself smaller as she remained on the floor. She looked up at him fearfully but didn’t say anything.

    “Good,” he continued with a grin on his face, “Then I guess you won’t mind if I take my things and go…I mean, if you don’t want me here I guess it wouldn’t matter if I left.”

    He then reached down and grabbed his tattered backpack as he began to walk towards the door. Her gaze remained fixed on him, not daring to look away for fear of angering him.

    “Oh, and Jennifer Lopez?” Jesse Burgess said as he opened the door to leave, “If you ever have a problem with any of my friends who want to come here, just remember that this is my home too. So if you try to kick them out like you did me then I will-”

    Jesse Burgess was cut off by a loud bang as the back door slammed shut behind him. He froze mid-sentence, turning to look at his old friend Karen Cooper as she emerged from the kitchen with an empty metal pot in one hand and a large wooden spoon in the other. “You heard him, right? This is his fucking home too!”

    “Yeah, I heard him!” she shouted angrily, raising the spoon high above her head. She then brought it down onto the end of the pot, causing it to make a loud clang as it hit the metal. Tears began to stream down her face as she continued to shout at Jesse Burgess despite not being able to see him anymore. “I’m tired of being pushed around! I don’t give a fuck what you do in your fucking house but you are not allowed here anymore! Just get out you son of a bitch!”

    She then sank down to the ground and wept silently, refusing to look at any of them as she finally gave in to her feelings of hurt and betrayal.

    “Are you okay?” Stephanie inquired concernedly from across the room. It had been many days since the group had last eaten anything substantial, and she worried that all this drama might be too much for Karen who was already thin and underweight.

    “Yeah…” Karen whimpered, wiping her face with her sleeve as she tried to compose herself. “I’m sorry, it’s just… I feel like I can’t fucking catch a break lately. You remember what happened to me and my family? Well, now people who were supposed to be my friends are turning against me too. We really aren’t so different from those people in the city after all, are we?”

    “No,” Stephanie admitted solemnly. “We aren’t so different. But you can’t look at it that way. It doesn’t matter how rotten and disgusting the rest of the world is because we are one thing they aren’t: we don’t give up! That is what you have to remind yourself when someone turns their back on you. You can never give up because if you do then… then… what have all of us worked so hard for? It would all be for nothing if we gave up now.”

    “I know, I know… I won’t give up.” Karen said, her voice shaking. “It’s just hard sometimes, you know?”

    “I know.” Stephanie said, pulling Karen into a hug.

Karen hugged Stephanie tightly, grateful for the words of encouragement. She knew that Stephanie was right: she couldn’t give up now. She had to be strong for the sake of her friends and herself.",0
The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"After that, I just need you to focus on getting better now.”

Lisa stood up at this point and walked into the other room to collect Daisy’s notebook. She returned to her chair and opened up the notebook. The first few pages were dedicated to instructions on how their family was going to take care of things while she was away, and the last few pages contained some words of wisdom that she wanted her children to read after they got over the initial shock of her passing.

Just before she started reading, Lisa stopped and held the notebook up for a moment, considering her words. “You know, maybe I shouldn’t read this part of the notebook to them.”

“Oh? Why not?”

“It might be too much to handle at one time. It might be too much for them to process all at once.”

Lisa stopped to consider that point for a moment, then looked up at Daisy. “Can I just tell them some things right now, and read the rest of the words later?”

“Of course. Whatever you think is best for your children. But there are some things that I have written down that I would like them to hear before I pass on.”

Lisa nodded her head and settled back into her chair. “Okay, well first, they should know that you wrote about how proud you were of them. Both the way they have dealt with this so far, and the way they have taken care of everything at home while I’m at the hospital with you. You talked a lot about how much confidence you had in them to do the job, even when I wasn’t here. You said that you thought Lisa was ready to handle almost everything, and that she was ready to take over the business if she ever had to. And you were also very proud of both of them for all their hard work in school. You said that you had a good feeling about the direction they were headed.” Lisa paused at this point, but she could see in Daisy’s eyes that she was still fully awake and listening. “I’m not sure when they should know about the other parts, though,” she continued. “You talked about some important things that will affect them when I’m gone. There were things that we need to talk about as a family. ”

At this point, Daisy’s eyelids began to flutter a little bit and she gasped for air. Lisa looked over at the nurse at the desk and made some hand gestures, which got her attention. The nurse came over and checked Daisy’s vital signs before looking back at Lisa and nodding. “It’s probably just a side effect from these injections,” she explained. “She might need some oxygen for a few minutes, but she should be fine. Give her a second to rest and then try to talk again.”

Lisa nodded and put the side of her hand on Daisy’s forehead to check her temperature. “I should have brought your hat,” she said as she thought about what else might be troubling Daisy.

“Is it going to be all right?” Daisy asked in a groggy voice. “Are you going to be there when everything happens?”

Lisa tried to speak through her own nervousness. “Of course I will be there,” she assured Daisy and then moved closer to listen as the nurse explained what was happening. “I think you might be getting a little bit of a fever,” she said as she took Daisy’s pulse. “They just need to give you some oxygen and we should be on our way again soon. You have been such a trooper,” the nurse continued before turning to Lisa and adding, “You’ve been doing a terrific job of taking care of her. She’s got a great family. I know she will be fine.”

Lisa tried to control her breathing and nodded in response. “As soon as they give you the okay, I’ll go sit with my mom in the waiting room. She’s already told me all the things she wanted me to know if something happened,” she said before the nurse could interrupt.

Daisy opened her eyes and slowly turned her head toward Lisa. “Thank you for being there for all of us today,” she said. “I know it hasn’t been easy for you, but if there is any way I can repay you someday, just let me know.”

Lisa reached out a hand and brought it to her lips in response. “I don’t want to talk  about that just yet. I just want to get through today and see how things look in the morning. After we talk to the doctor tomorrow, I’ll have a better idea of what we need to do after you leave here.”

When Lisa turned back toward Daisy, her eyes were filled with tears. The nurse stepped up beside them and wiped her hand on a tissue before reaching out to touch Daisy’s arm.

“Mrs. Mayberry, I think your daughter is worn out and needs to go home for a little while before coming back this evening. She has been such a help today and really been an inspiration to many of the other patients. I know she is a special person, but her strength today has been so uplifting to everyone here.”

Daisy nodded in agreement as the nurse spoke. “I think she should go home too. She gets up early every day, comes to take care of me, and then gets back here before dark to do whatever I need her to do. If you don’t mind, I would like her to stay here with me tonight. I want us to talk for a while before she goes home.”

Lisa glanced over at her and smiled weakly, but it was obvious that the emotional strain from the day was now starting to show. As they stood up and started walking toward the door, Lisa reached out and squeezed her mom’s hand. “I know you are tired, but I’m glad you are staying here tonight. I really want to talk about this afternoon and what happened in my office.”

“Me too,” Daisy said as she squeezed her hand back. “I think you should get some rest though because I want to tell you all about it while it is still fresh in my mind.”

They both smiled at one another as they walked out of the room and started down the hall toward Lisa’s office. There was a sudden explosion of activity around them as nurses and doctors scurried to and fro with charts, medicine carts, equipment, and other assorted paraphernalia. However, the commotion abruptly ended as they entered the hallway and walked by without a glance at them.

In the quiet of the hallway, they made their way down to Lisa’s office and took seats across from each other on her sofa. “Okay,  tell me everything you know about this trial,” Lisa said as she picked up her laptop and began turning it on.

Daisy sighed heavily as she sat back in the love seat and pulled her feet up underneath her. She pulled both hands through her hair in frustration, and then started talking. “I really don’t know much about it except that the doctor said it is an experimental treatment for people with the particular type of lung cancer I have. He told me that he was sending me to Memorial Hospital in St. Louis for an evaluation before I could be enrolled in the trial. He said he had been contacted by a research committee at the hospital and that they would meet me and evaluate me. I’m supposed to leave tomorrow at noon,” she said as she leaned back and covered her eyes with her hand.

Lisa sat behind her desk and folded her hands in front of her. “That’s great news! It will be such a relief to have you out of the house and somewhere where I can drop by whenever I need to. You’ve become too difficult to deal with lately,” she said. She quickly added, “I don’t mean that as an insult.”

Daisy looked at Lisa and smiled. “I know you didn’t mean it as an insult. I have been difficult to deal with lately, but maybe now that I am leaving for a while it will give you some rest and you won’t feel so overwhelmed. Maybe it will also relieve Bill of some of the stress he’s been under,” she said. They both sat silently for a moment before Daisy continued, “I think this could be the answer to our problems. I could come through this and we wouldn’t have to worry so much about where the money is going to come from. We could be financially secure again. And, as we used to say in school…it will be like having found the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.”

“I agree,” said Lisa. She then added, “But what about me? How do I know that you’re going to come through this and be fine? What if it doesn’t work out and you die anyway? How can I go on living without you? You’re all I have. Who is going to take care of me",1
The group of survivors must face the enemy and defeat him in order to survive in this new world.,"“We can’t just stay here; we have to do something,” said another spirit.

At that moment, another creature appeared in front of them standing on its hind legs like a human. This new creature was much smaller than the green one and his fur was brown instead of green. He also didn’t have fangs or claws and he had a friendly smile on his face. The group of spirits stared at the beast in awe before they ran over to him. The small animal looked up at them and smiled.

“Who are you? What are you doing here?” asked one of the spirits in a childlike voice as he ran up to the animal and hugged him.

The other spirits went up to the beast and petted him and scratched his chin. The stranger laughed a bit before saying, “I’m Ratzinger Kugelman and I live here too. I just came to see what all the activity was about. Is there a problem here?”

“Yes! There is a monster on the loose and it keeps chasing us! We can’t seem to get away from him! We need your help to stop him,” said one of the spirits as he took a step back from the small animal.

“Well, I think we need to be very careful. This must be a test of some sort. He could be after you for something, but for now, let me take care of him so you can all get back home safely. I’ve been waiting for an opportunity to meet you anyway, but we must all stick together now more than ever!”

“Yes. We have to stick together and not let monsters like that win!” said another spirit.

The spirits began walking with the stranger Ratzinger Kugelman as he led them over to the large rock in the middle of the stream. When they reached it, he crouched down and looked into a small hole between two rocks. Slowly, he moved his head up and peeked out at them. “He’s still there. I think if we all jump up on this rock now, then he won’t be able to reach us since we are so high up above the water. Do you all think you can manage hopping up on this rock? Then I’ll lead you home, but first we must all yell in unison. This is very important. When he hears this mysterious sound, he will no longer be able to find us!”

“Okay, we’re ready!” said one spirit.

They all climbed up onto the rock. Ratzinger Kugelman looked at them for a moment then faced the cave from which the monster emerged. Then he started to shout into the cave as loud as he could, “WURRRRRKKKK!” He shouted it several times with more and more force each time until all his energy was spent. As soon as he stopped, there was a loud rumble that shook the entire earth under their feet and they were all flung through the air into the water below. They landed in shallow water and coughed up water for a few moments until they could catch their breath.

After wiping their faces off, they looked at one another and said in unison, “Wurrrrkkk!”

The ground shook again with a powerful blast and they were all thrown into the air and into the bushes around them. They landed on their backs and rolled back over onto their stomachs with their hands covering their heads, only to be knocked unconscious by a third blast.

They all woke up in the same position, all covered with leaves, sticks and dirt. They looked around to make sure they were all there then started searching for Ratzinger Kugelman. They soon found him lying motionless on his back in the middle of a clearing. One of them walked over to him and examined his body to make sure he was dead. He was not moving, nor was he breathing. Then the other spirits joined them and they all sat around him in silence as they pondered what had just happened.

Finally, one of the spirits stood up and said, “He must have been telling the truth about the cave.”

Another spirit questioned, “What do you mean?”

The first spirit responded, “He must have gotten rid of the monster that way before we made him show us how it was done.”

“Well, he probably did it in a different way because we didn’t hear anything like that coming from him as he did it,” said another spirit.

The first spirit replied, “It doesn’t matter how he did it; the fact is that once again he saved our lives.”

Another spirit asked, “Then why did he let us get captured again?”

The other spirits looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders. They did not know why Ratzinger Kugelman had done what he had done but thanked him nonetheless for his generosity. Then they walked back to the cave and gathered all their things so they could continue their journey upriver. Again they were making good progress despite the dense vegetation and treacherous rocks. They had just passed a waterfall and were climbing a steep path when they heard a yell in front of them. They stopped to see what was going on when suddenly, from up the rocky embankment, Ratzinger Kugelman popped out and shouted, “Quick! Get behind me so you won’t be seen.”

They all quickly ran up to him, and just as they started looking out, they heard a loud roar coming from the bushes. When the roar was over they all looked around in disbelief then questioned him about what had just happened. He told them he had heard something moving in those bushes and suspected it may have been the monster following them. He told them to climb up higher where they would be safe from the roars and could see better.",0
Valerie uses her wits to escape the basement and evade John Doe.,"other women he had captured and how many other times he had broken into their homes.

“Who are you?” Valerie asked.

John Doe smiled at her and walked toward her, but he never took his eyes off of her while she was moving around, trying to find a way out of the basement. He smiled again when she stopped moving and stood in front of him with her arms crossed in front of herself like she was ready to fight him.

“I wouldn’t even if I were you,” he said. “No one is going to save you now, I made sure of that when I came through your front door. They will find you in the basement tied up and gagged behind my secret door, but they won’t be able to rescue you. No one can hear your screams down here because there is nothing above us except concrete and wood that dampens any noise made in your home. They will find you, but it will be too late for them to save you.”

He took the key out of his pocket and unlocked his handcuffs so that he could take the sword out of its scabbard on his back. He pointed the sword at her and asked her, “Do you really want to survive long enough to be put on trial for your crimes? I thought of letting you go, but then I realized that a person like you deserves to be punished.”

Valerie said, “You don’t know anything about me or my crimes. You just made all of that up because you want to feel powerful right now. It has nothing to do with me, but it has everything to do with you. You have always felt powerless in this world, so you are trying to feel powerful by making up stories about me and hoping that they are true.”

John Doe moved closer to Valerie while he was looking at her with a hungry look in his eyes. He stopped moving when he was only a few feet away from her. “Now, now,” he said. “I don’t make things up; I only tell the truth about people because it is more fun than making things up. I want you to live long enough to die slowly and painfully, but you won’t be able to do anything about it except give me the power that I deserve by trying to fight me off.”

Valerie moved closer to John Doe, and she gently touched the tip of the sword with her finger. She then asked him, “Why are you doing this? What did I ever do to you?”

John Doe said, “You never did anything to me, but you know what you did to others. If I can get justice for them through your death, then it will be worth everything that I have done here today.”

Valerie moved closer to John Doe and she whispered into his ear, “You cannot have the justice you are looking for through my death. What are you going to do next? Are you going to kill all of the people who wronged me?”

John Doe said, “No, I will not do anything like that anymore because I am done. You were my last victim. By killing you, I can finally have the peace of mind that I have been seeking for years.”

Valerie reached forward and grabbed John Doe by his shoulders with both of her hands. She then turned him around so that they were facing each other with their bodies only a few inches apart from each other. She said, “You will not have peace of mind until I make it through the night, and I will do whatever it takes to make sure that happens.”

John Doe said, “You are very smart. But you cannot outsmart me tonight, because tonight is when I finally get what I am looking for. Now move back to the other side of the table before you make a fatal mistake.”

Valerie moved back to her side of the table and she said, “I think we both know that is not going to happen. You cannot stop this from happening. This was meant to be for me and you have no say in it anymore.”

John Doe said, “I am not going to waste any more time talking with you now because I want this to be over before the sun comes up tomorrow morning. Now go over by that corner of the basement so I can get started with this project.”

Valerie moved over by her corner and she said, “Now what?”

John Doe said, “Now I am going to tie you up and gag you. Then I will leave through the back door so that nobody knows that this ever happened in here.”

Valerie said, “So we are going to go through with this? You really are a sick and twisted person.”

John Doe said, “You have no idea how sick and twisted I am if you think this is bad. Now stop talking before I show you exactly how sick and twisted I really am.”

After tying Valerie up and gagging her, John Doe left the basement through the back door. Valerie was all alone now, stuck in a basement full of death. She still had to make it through the night or else she would die and nobody would know what happened to her. She was afraid that John Doe would come back anytime soon, so she had to make sure that she could get out of the basement before he would show up again.

She managed to get herself free from the ropes and then she tried to find a way out of the basement. She was finally able to find a way out and she quickly got out of there before anybody would show up. She also managed to hide all traces of evidence, so no one would know what happened here tonight.

The rest of the night went by slowly for Valerie, until she finally made it to safety. She told the police everything that",1
Shannon Daniels loses her mother to cancer and feels alone and lost.,"Shannon Daniels had lost her mother to cancer. She had always been close to her mom and when she died she felt like a part of her had been ripped away. She felt sad and alone. Her dad was doing the best he could, but he was struggling too. He missed his wife and felt guilty that she had to go through so much pain before she finally passed away. They both wished they could go back and do things differently. They wished they had seen all the warning signs that Sara Daniels was sick, but it was too late to do anything once it was discovered that she had cancer. She died only a few weeks after the diagnosis.

Shannon felt lost and alone like she was missing half of herself, like her mom was still alive but now just a part of her. She still had her dad, but he was busy working all the time now that Sara was gone. He always took care of all the housework before, but now he had less time to do it and so Shannon found herself doing more around the house.

She missed her mom and she knew feeling sad was okay, but she felt so alone that she didn’t know what to do about it. She didn’t want to feel this way forever, but she couldn’t help wondering how her mom could be gone when they were so close. She knew she would have to go on living without her mom eventually because that was just life, but at that moment she didn’t want to accept it.

Shannon knew her dad would never let them go hungry or homeless, but he always worked long hours after work and she knew he missed his wife too. He told Shannon he needed the money so they could stay in their house and eat, but Shannon felt like the only thing anyone really remembered about her mom was how sick she had been and how much suffering it caused everyone.

Shannon never wanted anyone to have to suffer the way her mom did when she was sick, but now that she was gone there wasn’t much anyone could do besides wish for a cure for cancer. She felt like no one even remembered how close they were before Sara got sick. She liked remembering the good times much better than how sick her mom had been.

She missed everything about her mom and wondered if people forgot about how full of life she had been. She didn’t want everyone to forget about her mom because she was still a person and Shannon knew they would never forget if it had been their mom.

Shannon wondered how life would change if her mom had never gotten sick, but she knew it was pointless to think that way because all that thinking did was make her feel more sad. She didn’t want to feel sad anymore so she went into the house and wrote down all the things she remembered about her mom.

She wrote about how soft her skin felt, how she smelled like sunshine and sugar, and how she used to always brush Shannon’s hair before bed every night when she was little.

She remembered so many of the stories her mom used to tell her about growing up on their farm in Iowa, but none of them made her feel any better.

Shannon decided that she would just have to try to make new memories without her mom, but it was hard because every memory came with a longing for her mom to be there. Every memory made her feel even more empty.

Shannon wondered if anyone else ever felt this way or if everyone always remembered their loved ones in a good way after they were gone, but then she thought about how she had heard about people who lost someone important to them and still felt sad and lonely for years afterward.

Even though Shannon wasn’t alone, Shannon felt like she was the only person who understood what she was feeling. She didn’t know how people did it because it just wasn’t possible to feel good all the time when you had lost someone you loved.

Shannon went to school and listened to her teacher talk about the history of art, but she just couldn’t understand what they were talking about. She didn’t know why their teacher thought that stuff was so important because it seemed like such a waste of time.

Shannon didn’t feel like she had any time to waste, not with her mom gone. She wondered if her teacher knew what it felt like to lose someone so important because the teacher kept talking about how artists should express themselves freely in their work, but Shannon couldn’t do that.

Shannon was angry because she didn’t want to waste any time thinking about stuff that didn’t matter. She wanted to stop being sad and start being happy again.

She went home feeling mad at her teacher for talking about stuff that was so boring when her mom was gone. She went into her room and closed the door so she wouldn’t have to see her dad or her brother.

She didn’t feel like talking to them and they made her feel too sad. So Shannon went into the basement where she felt better because it was darker down there and nobody else wanted to be down there, not even her dad who usually loved hangin’ out in the basement.

Shannon liked hangin’ out in the basement because it felt kind of like she was sneaking around ‘cause no one knew she was there. Nobody ever told her that she shouldn’t be in the basement, but it just wasn’t a place where grown-ups would hang out very often.

Her dad had made it into another part of the house by building a big new room down there for his workshop, and he also put in a bathroom so they could use it whenever they wanted and not have to use the one upstairs. Shannon thought it was funny that her dad had built his own bathroom because she thought that grown-ups were supposed to have all kinds of stuff like that already built into their houses.

Her dad seemed like such a grown up to her because he had a big job and drove all around town in his big truck delivering packages. Her",1
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,", brushed her teeth, and went over to the bed. Aimee didn’t turn the lights on when she went into her bedroom but she knew that it wouldn’t be a problem finding her way around in the dark since she had been living in this apartment for so long now.

Aimee cuddled up with her pillow and tried to fall asleep but no matter how hard Aimee struggled, sleep was just not coming for her.

Aimee sat up and looked around the room, her eyes stopping on Kyle’s picture sitting on top of the dressing table. She hadn’t known Kyle that long but she liked him. He was a good guy and Aimee hoped that he would come back again soon because she really needed him right now.

Aimee walked over to the dressing table and sat down on top of the chair that was sitting next to it, which allowed Aimee to get a better look at Kyle’s picture.

Aimee gazed at the picture for a while before deciding that she should call Kyle and talk to him again, maybe he had remembered something else that could help Aimee figure out who she was supposed to be with.

Aimee picked up her cell phone and tapped in Kyle’s phone number and waited for him to pick up. She had his number in her phone but she had never actually called him before so Aimee was a bit surprised when Kyle answered on the first ring.

“Hi Kyle, it’s me Aimee.”

Aimee listened as Kyle said hello and told her that he was about to call her because he wanted to know how she was doing.

“I’m fine, I just wanted to talk to you again if it’s okay with you?” she asked.

Kyle told her that of course it was okay with him and that he was happy to hear from her again. He told Aimee that it didn’t matter if they talked about whatever or nothing at all because he enjoyed talking to Aimee and hoped that she would call him whenever she needed someone to talk to.

Aimee thanked Kyle for his support and told him that she would call back tomorrow because right now, she wanted to get some sleep.

Kyle told Aimee “Goodnight” and hung up after telling her that he would talk to her again the next day.

Aimee stood in her living room a few minutes after ending her short chat with Kyle. She was alone, the same way she had been when she was younger. She was lonely and she didn’t think there was anyone who could understand why. She had grown up in a family where being single meant loneliness, and being alone meant that one wasn’t good enough for anything more than solitude. Her parents were married and loved each other but their love had come late in life. Her father had been married several times before meeting her mother, and while he claimed to have loved each of his previous wives, the truth was that he had left them all because he was afraid of being alone.

Aimee had always felt unloved and unwanted, an emotion that she couldn’t shake just because she now lived on her own.

She went into her bedroom and turned off the light before climbing into bed. She rolled over on her side and closed her eyes but the effort to sleep was too great. She tossed and turned for hours but she never fell asleep.

Aimee finally gave up trying to sleep and went into the living room where she sat on the sofa and turned on the television. She flipped through channels but none of them held her attention. Her loneliness and fear of being unloved pressed in on her, suffocating her, making it impossible for her to relax.

She cried silently and fought back tears as she wondered what Kyle would think of her if he knew how alone she was. She wished he had been there that first night when she had come home so that he could have seen how ugly and lonely she felt when she was all alone in her apartment, surrounded by emptiness.

She wished Kyle was there with her right now so that they could share a comforting moment together. She wanted him to hold her and tell her that everything would be all right, but he wasn’t there. He was on the other side of the country with his family, enjoying the holidays with his wife and son.

She called Kyle because she wanted him close to her, even if it meant only talking to him on the phone. But now she found herself wishing he had never called earlier that day, because he would be close enough for her to go see him if she really wanted but instead he was far away and unreachable.

She cried even harder as she realized how much she wanted Kyle to be with her. She wished Kyle was there so that he could take her mind off of everything that was wrong in her life and everything that made her afraid: being alone, being unloved, not being good enough for anyone to love.

Kyle must have known all along that Aimee struggled with these fears. She had often confided in him about them, not knowing that he knew all along what she was really saying, wishing he could love her and make it all better.

But he never did anything about it; at least not in the way Aimee wanted. He always listened sympathetically and offered her reassurance. But nothing ever changed the way she felt. Nothing ever made her feel less lonely or unloved, and nothing ever made her believe that things would be okay in the future.

Aimee wished that Kyle could tell her that everything was going to turn out all right, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t make any promises without knowing how things were going to turn out for himself as well. He might get divorced and his son might grow up and move away from him, leaving him all alone in the world.

Aimee felt bad for wishing that Kyle’s life would",0
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"however, there was an old dilapidated swing-set that had seen better days. He walked back over to his phone and dialed Jeremy’s number.
 Jeremy answered after two rings. “Hey man, what’s up?”
 “I can see you right now. Can you see me?” Gabriel asked as he peeked around the corner of his apartment.
 Jeremy laughed on the other end of the line, “Of course. We can see everything through these windows and doors. You can see us, we can see you, and we can even smell what you are cooking for dinner every now and then.”
 “How is it there?”
 “It’s great man, we are loving it. We threw a big barbecue over there last night to welcome ourselves to the neighborhood,” Jeremy said as he laughed heartily at his own joke. “See you later man, gotta run. I have a meeting in fifteen minutes and I’m already late as it is. Talk to you later man, bye!”
 “Bye Jeremy!” Gabriel said as he put his phone down and walked over to the kitchen. He grabbed two plates and cutlery sets before walking back into his room and calling out to Julio.
 “Dinner is ready!” he called out.
 Julio was sitting on the couch reading a brand-new copy of Gabriel García Márquez’s 100 Years of Solitude when Gabriel entered the room. He closed his book and stood up before smiling at Gabriel as he sat down on the couch next to him.
 “Thank you son,” Julio said as he patted Gabriel’s hand. “I am very hungry, what did you cook for us?”
 “Pasta with meatballs and a side of garlic bread,” Gabriel said as he walked toward the kitchen and served himself before returning to sit down next to his father. “So, how are you settling in? You haven’t been out of the apartment much since moving in yesterday.”
 “It is going very well and I am very happy here. I have been sleeping quite comfortably for the most part, although I did not like having to sleep alone last night,” Julio said as he started eating his portion of pasta.
 “You can sleep with me tonight if you like, Dad.”
 “No thank you. That is not a problem for me,” Julio said as he took another forkful of pasta in his mouth and began chewing it slowly. “I have missed being able to talk so much with you over the last few years, Gabriel. It seems so strange to finally be able to do that again and about whatever we choose to discuss.”
 “I have missed it too, Dad, I really have,” Gabriel said before he began eating the pasta on his own plate. “So tell me what is going on in your life at the moment; I haven’t heard much from you since I got here.”
After a pause, Julio answered him. “Well, for one thing my acting career has taken off in the past two years since your mother and brother left me. I have been offered a lot of work over that period, both in film and on the stage.”
As he ate his pasta, Gabriel listened intently to everything that Julio was saying to him about his acting career. He could not help but wonder what had motivated his father to ask him to help him move into the apartment so that he could be closer to his daughter and grandchild.
“I am also directing one of the plays myself as well,” Julio continued, “called The Merchant of Venice. You will probably recall that it is the famous story about Shylock who wants a pound of flesh if he doesn’t get his money back from Antonio; it is a role I am very excited to be playing. I have made some wonderful contacts in the theater in Los Angeles and I am hoping that some of them will allow me to direct other plays for them soon.”
Julio then told Gabriel about a couple of other theater projects that he was involved in at the moment, as well as some films and TV programs that were being shot in South America. Even though Julio had been an actor for many years, it still seemed incredible to Gabriel that he was now directing one of the greatest plays ever written in history.
“It is very exciting for me Gabriel, it really is. I know that you are very excited too; your mother and I have always wanted you to become a writer too when you grew up,” Julio said. He was beginning to get concerned about having his son moving away from home and decided that it would be a good idea for him to spend some time with him before he left.
“I am sure that we can have a great time together, can’t we?” Julio asked.
Gabriel thought about this for a while and realized that he was actually looking forward to spending time with his father. At the same time, he didn’t want to neglect his new opportunities either.
“I suppose so, but there are some things that I have to do too, like get some furniture and other things for the apartment. There is a furniture store close to your apartment building, so I will probably go over there tomorrow afternoon,” Gabriel told Julio.
“I am sure that you can do whatever you want during the day, but I will be busy with rehearsals all day until 7:00 at night,” Julio explained.
“Is there not another time when we can arrange to meet up that will suit both of us? I don’t want us to miss out on time together because of scheduling conflicts,” Gabriel said.
He was hoping that Julio would agree to some other time, so that he and Rich could see each other as well. He didn’t think that he had spoken to his friend for a few days now.
“Well, I suppose we can meet up tomorrow evening after my rehearsal. I will come over to your apartment at around 8:00 and we can go out for dinner or something,” Julio said.
“That sounds great, I will see you tomorrow then,” Gabriel said as he got up to leave.
He was glad that they had been able to work something out and he was looking forward to spending some time with his father.",0
Valerie makes it to safety and the police catch John Doe.,"happened and they started looking for John Doe. It did not take long for them to find him, because whenever John Doe was in one of his killing rampages, he left a large amount of evidence behind. Once again, the police caught John Doe and this time they put him in jail where he would stay for good.

--------------------------------

The story ended with these last few sentences: Police officer Jones walked into the room. “Well, I’m glad you decided to come and talk to us again, Valerie.”

Valerie said, “Yes officer Jones, I know exactly what you want to ask me about and I have some interesting information for you.”

Jones said, “We have some evidence that John Doe is the person who killed these women, not you. We also have some evidence that points to someone else as being a possible accomplice of his. And we know for sure that somebody helped him in his killings, because he never could have done it all by himself. And it would be really great if you could help us with this puzzle and give us some more information about what he did and where he did it exactly.”

Valerie said, “Yes officer Jones, I have some new very interesting information for you, but I will tell you only if you help me first.”

Jones said, “You want my help? My partner and I have been working on this case for a long time now, and it would be really helpful if you could tell us something new we don’t know.”

Valerie said, “Yes officer Jones, I have some very interesting new information for you. But first I want you to untie me and let me go. And then I will tell you what John Doe told me, because he told me before he killed the last victim.”

Jones said, “Ok Valerie, we can do that. Do you still want to press charges against John Doe for his other crimes?”

Valerie replied, “No I don’t want to press any charges against him, because I am very grateful for all his help and I want to make sure he is not executed. The only punishment I want for him is that he has to spend the rest of his life in jail. He cannot be allowed to kill innocent people anymore, because there are many other women who need protecting.”

Jones said, “Ok then Valerie, we will let you go. But first give us the address of your house so that we can verify what you are telling us is true.”

Valerie said, “Sure thing officer Jones. Thank you for being so reasonable about this, and thank you for releasing me. So here is my address: 123 Fake Street, Anytown USA.”

Jones said, “I have no reason to believe you are lying about this address, but let me check it in my database anyway. It will only take a minute.”

Jones typed in the address into his computer and then looked up at her and said, “Ok Valerie this is real. Now Valerie tell me what happened so we can solve your case.”

Valerie said, “Ok sir Jones I have some very useful information for you about the John Doe case. I had a lot of time to think about my situation while I was there in that basement, and it really got me thinking about how we treat criminals in our society today. I think we need to start punishing criminals much more harshly for their crimes so that they will not commit them again. Because clearly the current punishments aren’t working.”

Jones said, “In what way are they not working? Are repeat criminals walking free from court every day?”

Valerie said, “No sir but the punishments are not harsh enough for these repeat criminals to deter them from re-offending. You see when you get put behind bars for life or executed, it doesn’t actually stop most people from committing crime. They know that they could easily get caught and put behind bars so they just don’t get caught doing anything bad. The way I see it, the reason repeat offenders keep on going is because they know that the punishments aren’t harsh enough to stop them, but they also know that if they were caught being bad again then it would be a whole different matter because this time around, they wouldn’t get out of jail or be executed at all. They would be put away for life without any chance of parole and they would never ever see the light of day again! So if we want these people to stop committing crime, then we need to make sure that when they are caught committing a crime it is an offense for which they can never ever get out of prison.”

Officer Jones said, “And what does any of this have to do with you? And why are you here Valerie from the UK?”

Valerie said, “It does have a lot to do with me officer. The reason I’m here is because I was supposed to die today. You see I used to be a girl, but now I’m not. A few days ago, it was my best friend who was meant to die in this basement, but she didn’t because some man with a knife came and saved her and took me instead. He said he wanted somebody from this country and that is why he took me instead of her. The police came later and rescued us both from the hotel room that the man had locked us in. Once they had me up here in your interrogation room I started talking about how unfair it was that there is a two-tier justice system in this country where rich people are allowed to get off with lesser crimes than normal people. And also how unfair it was that if you are rich enough you can just buy yourself out of punishment altogether, like what happened recently in the banking industry, where all the bankers were caught doing those really bad things, but instead of being punished, they were just given loads of money to leave. And I said that it wasn’t fair and that something needed to be done about it, and then I was brought down here to this room.”

The officer looked at her for a moment and then said, “You’re lucky that you’re alive. If John Doe had got his hands on you, you would be dead now. We managed to catch him before he could do anything to you. He’s in custody and he will be going to prison for a very long time.",1
The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"After that, I just need you to focus on getting better now.”

Lisa stood up at this point and walked into the other room to collect Daisy’s notebook. She returned to her chair and opened up the notebook. The first few pages were dedicated to instructions on how their family was going to take care of things while she was away, and the last few pages contained some words of wisdom that she wanted her children to read after they got over the initial shock of her passing.

Just before she started reading, Lisa stopped and held the notebook up for a moment, considering her words. “You know, maybe I shouldn’t read this part of the notebook to them.”

“Oh? Why not?”

“It might be too much to handle at one time. It might be too much for them to process all at once.”

Lisa stopped to consider that point for a moment, then looked up at Daisy. “Can I just tell them some things right now, and read the rest of the words later?”

“Of course. Whatever you think is best for your children. But there are some things that I have written down that I would like them to hear before I pass on.”

Lisa nodded her head and settled back into her chair. “Okay, well first, they should know that you wrote about how proud you were of them. Both the way they have dealt with this so far, and the way they have taken care of everything at home while I’m at the hospital with you. You talked a lot about how much confidence you had in them to do the job, even when I wasn’t here. You said that you thought Lisa was ready to handle almost everything, and that she was ready to take over the business if she ever had to. And you were also very proud of both of them for all their hard work in school. You said that you had a good feeling about the direction they were headed.” Lisa paused at this point, but she could see in Daisy’s eyes that she was still fully awake and listening. “I’m not sure when they should know about the other parts, though,” she continued. “You talked about some important things that will affect them when I’m gone. There were things that we need to talk about as a family. ”

At this point, Daisy’s eyelids began to flutter a little bit and she gasped for air. Lisa looked over at the nurse at the desk and made some hand gestures, which got her attention. The nurse came over and checked Daisy’s vital signs before looking back at Lisa and nodding. “It’s probably just a side effect from these injections,” she explained. “She might need some oxygen for a few minutes, but she should be fine. Give her a second to rest and then try to talk again.”

Lisa nodded and put the side of her hand on Daisy’s forehead to check her temperature. “I should have brought your hat,” she said as she thought about what else might be troubling Daisy.

“Is it going to be all right?” Daisy asked in a groggy voice. “Are you going to be there when everything happens?”

Lisa tried to speak through her own nervousness. “Of course I will be there,” she assured Daisy and then moved closer to listen as the nurse explained what was happening. “I think you might be getting a little bit of a fever,” she said as she took Daisy’s pulse. “They just need to give you some oxygen and we should be on our way again soon. You have been such a trooper,” the nurse continued before turning to Lisa and adding, “You’ve been doing a terrific job of taking care of her. She’s got a great family. I know she will be fine.”

Lisa tried to control her breathing and nodded in response. “As soon as they give you the okay, I’ll go sit with my mom in the waiting room. She’s already told me all the things she wanted me to know if something happened,” she said before the nurse could interrupt.

Daisy opened her eyes and slowly turned her head toward Lisa. “Thank you for being there for all of us today,” she said. “I know it hasn’t been easy for you, but if there is any way I can repay you someday, just let me know.”

Lisa reached out a hand and brought it to her lips in response. “I don’t want to talk  about that just yet. I just want to get through today and see how things look in the morning. After we talk to the doctor tomorrow, I’ll have a better idea of what we need to do after you leave here.”

When Lisa turned back toward Daisy, her eyes were filled with tears. The nurse stepped up beside them and wiped her hand on a tissue before reaching out to touch Daisy’s arm.

“Mrs. Mayberry, I think your daughter is worn out and needs to go home for a little while before coming back this evening. She has been such a help today and really been an inspiration to many of the other patients. I know she is a special person, but her strength today has been so uplifting to everyone here.”

Daisy nodded in agreement as the nurse spoke. “I think she should go home too. She gets up early every day, comes to take care of me, and then gets back here before dark to do whatever I need her to do. If you don’t mind, I would like her to stay here with me tonight. I want us to talk for a while before she goes home.”

Lisa glanced over at her and smiled weakly, but it was obvious that the emotional strain from the day was now starting to show. As they stood up and started walking toward the door, Lisa reached out and squeezed her mom’s hand. “I know you are tired, but I’m glad you are staying here tonight. I really want to talk about this afternoon and what happened in my office.”

“Me too,” Daisy said as she squeezed her hand back. “I think you should get some rest though because I want to tell you all about it while it is still fresh in my mind.”

They both smiled at one another as they walked out of the room and started down the hall toward Lisa’s office. There was a sudden explosion of activity around them as nurses and doctors scurried to and fro with charts, medicine carts, equipment, and other assorted paraphernalia. However, the commotion abruptly ended as they entered the hallway and walked by without a glance at them.

In the quiet of the hallway, they made their way down to Lisa’s office and took seats across from each other on her sofa. “Okay,  tell me everything you know about this trial,” Lisa said as she picked up her laptop and began turning it on.

Daisy sighed heavily as she sat back in the love seat and pulled her feet up underneath her. She pulled both hands through her hair in frustration, and then started talking. “I really don’t know much about it except that the doctor said it is an experimental treatment for people with the particular type of lung cancer I have. He told me that he was sending me to Memorial Hospital in St. Louis for an evaluation before I could be enrolled in the trial. He said he had been contacted by a research committee at the hospital and that they would meet me and evaluate me. I’m supposed to leave tomorrow at noon,” she said as she leaned back and covered her eyes with her hand.

Lisa sat behind her desk and folded her hands in front of her. “That’s great news! It will be such a relief to have you out of the house and somewhere where I can drop by whenever I need to. You’ve become too difficult to deal with lately,” she said. She quickly added, “I don’t mean that as an insult.”

Daisy looked at Lisa and smiled. “I know you didn’t mean it as an insult. I have been difficult to deal with lately, but maybe now that I am leaving for a while it will give you some rest and you won’t feel so overwhelmed. Maybe it will also relieve Bill of some of the stress he’s been under,” she said. They both sat silently for a moment before Daisy continued, “I think this could be the answer to our problems. I could come through this and we wouldn’t have to worry so much about where the money is going to come from. We could be financially secure again. And, as we used to say in school…it will be like having found the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.”

“I agree,” said Lisa. She then added, “But what about me? How do I know that you’re going to come through this and be fine? What if it doesn’t work out and you die anyway? How can I go on living without you? You’re all I have. Who is going to take care of me",1
"The group must overcome obstacles such as hunger, thirst, and the dangers of the outside world in order to escape.","collecting between his head and the floor, and Jennifer Lopez felt sick at the sight.

    “What did you do?” she asked once again, shaking her head in disbelief.

    “He tried to escape,” one of the men explained, “We caught him heading towards the door. We had to tie him up before he hurt somebody or got away!”

    “But why?” Jennifer Lopez asked, still refusing to believe them, “Why would you do that? We don’t have anything we need here- we can find food and water easily outside!”

    “No, you’re wrong,” one of them explained, “The people outside are just like us. They don’t know what is going on or where they should go. Everybody is confused and scared right now. You can see the effects it has had- all of the food has been taken from our houses because everyone is so hungry. Everything that can be used has been used, and now there isn’t anything left. It doesn’t matter if we stay here or go outside- we will both die if we don’t get help soon.”

    The two men stared at her for a moment before nodding in agreement. They then approached Jesse Burgess who had been tied to the chair. They untied him, and he stood up, rubbing his wrists awkwardly.

    “Thanks,” he said sarcastically as he rubbed his wrists, “I didn’t need that.”

    Both men walked towards the back door in silence, leaving only Jennifer Lopez and Jesse Burgess in the kitchen. She stood there still rubbing her eyes and shaking her head as she watched them walk away. She wished that she could believe what they had said. But it was simply too hard to trust anyone anymore- especially someone who had been a terrible person for as long as Jesse Burgess had been.

    Suddenly she felt her body being shoved back by Jesse Burgess with surprising strength. She fell onto the floor, and he stood over her, staring down at her with his ugly face and cold eyes.

    “You don’t trust me?” he asked in a threatening voice, “Well, you should have thought of that before you said I wasn’t welcome here. What, do you think you can just kick someone out of their home whenever you feel like it?”

    She tried to make herself smaller as she remained on the floor. She looked up at him fearfully but didn’t say anything.

    “Good,” he continued with a grin on his face, “Then I guess you won’t mind if I take my things and go…I mean, if you don’t want me here I guess it wouldn’t matter if I left.”

    He then reached down and grabbed his tattered backpack as he began to walk towards the door. Her gaze remained fixed on him, not daring to look away for fear of angering him.

    “Oh, and Jennifer Lopez?” Jesse Burgess said as he opened the door to leave, “If you ever have a problem with any of my friends who want to come here, just remember that this is my home too. So if you try to kick them out like you did me then I will-”

    Jesse Burgess was cut off by a loud bang as the back door slammed shut behind him. He froze mid-sentence, turning to look at his old friend Karen Cooper as she emerged from the kitchen with an empty metal pot in one hand and a large wooden spoon in the other. “You heard him, right? This is his fucking home too!”

    “Yeah, I heard him!” she shouted angrily, raising the spoon high above her head. She then brought it down onto the end of the pot, causing it to make a loud clang as it hit the metal. Tears began to stream down her face as she continued to shout at Jesse Burgess despite not being able to see him anymore. “I’m tired of being pushed around! I don’t give a fuck what you do in your fucking house but you are not allowed here anymore! Just get out you son of a bitch!”

    She then sank down to the ground and wept silently, refusing to look at any of them as she finally gave in to her feelings of hurt and betrayal.

    “Are you okay?” Stephanie inquired concernedly from across the room. It had been many days since the group had last eaten anything substantial, and she worried that all this drama might be too much for Karen who was already thin and underweight.

    “Yeah…” Karen whimpered, wiping her face with her sleeve as she tried to compose herself. “I’m sorry, it’s just… I feel like I can’t fucking catch a break lately. You remember what happened to me and my family? Well, now people who were supposed to be my friends are turning against me too. We really aren’t so different from those people in the city after all, are we?”

    “No,” Stephanie admitted solemnly. “We aren’t so different. But you can’t look at it that way. It doesn’t matter how rotten and disgusting the rest of the world is because we are one thing they aren’t: we don’t give up! That is what you have to remind yourself when someone turns their back on you. You can never give up because if you do then… then… what have all of us worked so hard for? It would all be for nothing if we gave up now.”

    “I know, I know… I won’t give up.” Karen said, her voice shaking. “It’s just hard sometimes, you know?”

    “I know.” Stephanie said, pulling Karen into a hug.

Karen hugged Stephanie tightly, grateful for the words of encouragement. She knew that Stephanie was right: she couldn’t give up now. She had to be strong for the sake of her friends and herself.",0
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,", brushed her teeth, and went over to the bed. Aimee didn’t turn the lights on when she went into her bedroom but she knew that it wouldn’t be a problem finding her way around in the dark since she had been living in this apartment for so long now.

Aimee cuddled up with her pillow and tried to fall asleep but no matter how hard Aimee struggled, sleep was just not coming for her.

Aimee sat up and looked around the room, her eyes stopping on Kyle’s picture sitting on top of the dressing table. She hadn’t known Kyle that long but she liked him. He was a good guy and Aimee hoped that he would come back again soon because she really needed him right now.

Aimee walked over to the dressing table and sat down on top of the chair that was sitting next to it, which allowed Aimee to get a better look at Kyle’s picture.

Aimee gazed at the picture for a while before deciding that she should call Kyle and talk to him again, maybe he had remembered something else that could help Aimee figure out who she was supposed to be with.

Aimee picked up her cell phone and tapped in Kyle’s phone number and waited for him to pick up. She had his number in her phone but she had never actually called him before so Aimee was a bit surprised when Kyle answered on the first ring.

“Hi Kyle, it’s me Aimee.”

Aimee listened as Kyle said hello and told her that he was about to call her because he wanted to know how she was doing.

“I’m fine, I just wanted to talk to you again if it’s okay with you?” she asked.

Kyle told her that of course it was okay with him and that he was happy to hear from her again. He told Aimee that it didn’t matter if they talked about whatever or nothing at all because he enjoyed talking to Aimee and hoped that she would call him whenever she needed someone to talk to.

Aimee thanked Kyle for his support and told him that she would call back tomorrow because right now, she wanted to get some sleep.

Kyle told Aimee “Goodnight” and hung up after telling her that he would talk to her again the next day.

Aimee stood in her living room a few minutes after ending her short chat with Kyle. She was alone, the same way she had been when she was younger. She was lonely and she didn’t think there was anyone who could understand why. She had grown up in a family where being single meant loneliness, and being alone meant that one wasn’t good enough for anything more than solitude. Her parents were married and loved each other but their love had come late in life. Her father had been married several times before meeting her mother, and while he claimed to have loved each of his previous wives, the truth was that he had left them all because he was afraid of being alone.

Aimee had always felt unloved and unwanted, an emotion that she couldn’t shake just because she now lived on her own.

She went into her bedroom and turned off the light before climbing into bed. She rolled over on her side and closed her eyes but the effort to sleep was too great. She tossed and turned for hours but she never fell asleep.

Aimee finally gave up trying to sleep and went into the living room where she sat on the sofa and turned on the television. She flipped through channels but none of them held her attention. Her loneliness and fear of being unloved pressed in on her, suffocating her, making it impossible for her to relax.

She cried silently and fought back tears as she wondered what Kyle would think of her if he knew how alone she was. She wished he had been there that first night when she had come home so that he could have seen how ugly and lonely she felt when she was all alone in her apartment, surrounded by emptiness.

She wished Kyle was there with her right now so that they could share a comforting moment together. She wanted him to hold her and tell her that everything would be all right, but he wasn’t there. He was on the other side of the country with his family, enjoying the holidays with his wife and son.

She called Kyle because she wanted him close to her, even if it meant only talking to him on the phone. But now she found herself wishing he had never called earlier that day, because he would be close enough for her to go see him if she really wanted but instead he was far away and unreachable.

She cried even harder as she realized how much she wanted Kyle to be with her. She wished Kyle was there so that he could take her mind off of everything that was wrong in her life and everything that made her afraid: being alone, being unloved, not being good enough for anyone to love.

Kyle must have known all along that Aimee struggled with these fears. She had often confided in him about them, not knowing that he knew all along what she was really saying, wishing he could love her and make it all better.

But he never did anything about it; at least not in the way Aimee wanted. He always listened sympathetically and offered her reassurance. But nothing ever changed the way she felt. Nothing ever made her feel less lonely or unloved, and nothing ever made her believe that things would be okay in the future.

Aimee wished that Kyle could tell her that everything was going to turn out all right, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t make any promises without knowing how things were going to turn out for himself as well. He might get divorced and his son might grow up and move away from him, leaving him all alone in the world.

Aimee felt bad for wishing that Kyle’s life would",0
"Shannon lands her first major assignment, a feature on the inner city, but quickly discovers that the ugly reality of life in the city is far different from the dream she imagined.",", she wasn’t sure if she could be as good as them.

Shannon was also worried about her future because of the economy. Her father’s newspaper was in financial trouble, and she was sure that it would soon close. He had been trying to find investors to buy the paper for a while now, but was having no luck. It was very upsetting to her that his efforts seemed so futile.

She didn’t know what she would do if the newspaper closed because she had never thought about going to another newspaper or working for another company. She wondered if there were many jobs available in her field, which was writing. She also didn’t know if she wanted to leave the house and find a job somewhere else. Since she had finished high school, it had been hard for her to stay away from home.

The only time she felt comfortable leaving the house was when she was going to work with her father on his newspaper at night or during the weekend and sometimes for lunches and dinners too. She really liked being on the newspaper staff because that was the only place where she could be around other people and hear about how they were feeling or what was happening in their lives. Sometimes she thought that the people who worked for her dad were more of her friends than the people who she talked to at school or in her neighborhood or anyone else she knew.

Shannon was still amazed at how lucky she was to have gotten a job with her father. She had tried many jobs when she was younger, including being a cashier at the grocery store, but nothing seemed right until she got her job with the newspaper. The work at the newspaper was very different from anything else she had ever done before because it gave her so much freedom to do what she wanted and say what she wanted. Plus, the people on the newspaper staff were very cool and were always doing fun things with each other and they always took her along with them when they did these things.

When Shannon got to school, she sat down at her desk in the computer lab and opened her email to see if anything had come in that might interest her for a news story. Before they started working on their projects, Ms. Walker told them that they would not have time to check their email when they got home, so she wanted them all to check it before class started.

There was one email from someone who had been referred to Shannon by her school counselor who said that he had written an article about the drug dealers in his neighborhood. He asked if Shannon would be interested in writing a story about them too. She was very interested, so she emailed him back and asked if he could send it to her at school because she did not have a computer at home. He said that he would be glad to, so Shannon waited for him after school so that he could bring his article to her. She didn’t know what his story was about, but she knew it was a good idea because the drug dealers in her own neighborhood were out of control.

Soon, this boy was standing in front of the computer lab door waiting for Shannon to let him in. He had long hair and a mustache and was wearing an Army style jacket with patches all over it. Even though he looked kind of scary, Shannon knew that he wouldn’t do anything bad to her because her dad was the editor of the paper and he would never do anything to harm any of them. He came into the computer lab and introduced himself as Gary Saunders, Jr. His parents owned a convenience store in their neighborhood and they also sold cigarettes out of it. Gary told Shannon that the drug dealers were driving local businesses like his parents’ store out of business and that he wanted to do something about it.

Shannon was very impressed with Gary because he was only in seventh grade but he was already doing something to change things in his own community. She couldn’t even imagine being old enough to go out into the community and try to make a difference, so she asked him how old he was. He said that he was thirteen which meant that she was two years older than him. She told him that she would love to write about what he was doing and that they should meet up once she finished her story for the newspaper so that he could tell her more about how he wanted things in his neighborhood to change.

In the meantime, Shannon wanted to get more information on how the drug dealers were destroying things in their neighborhood. Her dad usually didn’t go to these kinds of meetings, but he agreed to take her to one and Shannon was very excited about this opportunity. They asked one of the reporters on staff if they could ride along with him because they really didn’t have time to go on their own, so he kindly agreed to take them with him. When they arrived at the meeting, Shannon was surprised to see that it had already started and everyone was waiting for them. The reporters were told that they could sit in the back and Shannon was glad because she didn’t want to be in the way. As she watched everyone talk about their concerns, she couldn’t help but overhear some of what was being said. One of the men who seemed to be speaking for the group made sure that everyone knew that he didn’t mean any harm towards anyone - he just wanted to protect his family and community from drugs. He went on to say that before drugs came around, his family didn’t have a problem with gangs or violence. Everyone was polite and kept their promises. The gangs sold drugs mostly in their neighborhood, but also in some of the other neighborhoods around them. Now they are too scared to step outside their homes even during the day. He ended by saying that he loves his neighbors but a lot of them are just afraid right now and that they know it’s not going to get better if they don’t do something about it now.

Shannon was very impressed with this man’s ability to speak up for his neighbors and she wondered why no one else had said anything yet. As soon as the meeting ended, she took some notes and then went over to talk to him and",0
"Shannon's father, Mike, dies unexpectedly, leaving her determined to follow in his footsteps and become a successful journalist.","Shannon Doyle was twenty years old, with a big, round face and thick brown hair that she wore in a long pageboy style. She had inherited her father’s big brown eyes and his determination to make something of herself. She was tall and slender, with a strong, athletic build like her mother’s. Her arms were thickly muscled from years of working out in the gym, where she started doing chin-ups when she was only three years old. She had just graduated from college with a degree in journalism and was looking forward to starting as a reporter at the Post in a few weeks.

Shannon had always wanted to be a journalist ever since she could remember. At age ten, she had started writing an advice column for the local paper in her hometown of Indianapolis. When she turned sixteen, her father finally allowed her to write articles for the daily newspaper, and continued to support her efforts after he took a job as a regional correspondent for The Times.

She followed in his footsteps because he had been her role model; she wanted to be just like him someday. The only downside to following in her father’s footsteps as a journalist was that when she had tried out for the cheerleading team in high school, she had not even managed to make the junior varsity squad because she was too busy with her newspaper route to practice.

Shannon’s father had died suddenly just two weeks before, from a heart attack at the age of fifty-seven. His death was unexpected and shocking; not only had he seemed healthy enough when Shannon saw him a few days before, but he left behind a loving family and an accomplished career. He was a successful reporter for a top national newspaper and made frequent appearances on television news shows. His colleagues were shocked by his sudden death, but so too were family members and friends, many of whom thought he would live to be over eighty.

He had three children—Shannon, their eldest child, eighteen-year-old Greg, who was a freshman at Georgetown University and their youngest son John, who was sixteen years old. He had been happily married to Shannon’s mother for over twenty-five years and never did anything irresponsible. He didn’t smoke or drink excessively or spend recklessly on lavish vacations or expensive clothes.

Shannon recalled that her father seemed unusually fit the last time they saw each other at home just two days before his death, when he looked healthy and full of energy as usual. She was shocked when she heard he had died and couldn’t believe it until she saw his body in the funeral home.

She remembered him for being a warm and playful parent who had always been there for her, teaching her how to swim and ride a bike, taking her to museums on weekends when there was no school. He loved to tell stories about his life as a reporter and regale his children with tales about famous politicians and entertainers whom he had met over the years. He made them laugh with funny anecdotes and clever jokes, making them forget their daily stress and problems at school or in the neighborhood.

When Shannon began working on her journalism project, she thought about the legacy her father had left behind and how proud he would have been if he could see how well she was doing in school. She was determined to finish high school at the top of her class—her parents had always urged her to study hard and aim for the top—and now she would do exactly that. She wanted to continue his good work by becoming a successful journalist herself.

But now that he was gone, she felt somewhat lost and unsure of herself, uncertain about whether she could continue without his support and encouragement. She knew that he would have been very proud to see her working on her journalism project. She thought about his words of wisdom: “Follow your instincts and work hard, no matter what you do in life.”

She remembered one time when she was in fourth grade and had come home from school one afternoon with good grades on her report card. Her father had heard her coming down the stairs and came out of the kitchen with a smile on his face to ask, “So, Shannon, how did you do today?” She smiled back and said with pride, “I got mostly A’s again this semester.” He asked if she was going to be a good student when she grew up.

He was pleased when Shannon said, “Yes. But I think I want to be a writer instead of an English teacher like you are.” He grinned at her and said, “That’s nice! But what about teaching or writing? You can’t be good at both things; you have to choose one.”

She thought about her father’s question when she was working on her journalism project for the next few days, but she couldn’t decide whether teaching or writing would be easier for her. Shannon was not only a good student, but her father also thought that she had talent as a writer. She had always enjoyed writing poems, stories, and essays in school and at home. She loved to read books and newspapers and share information with others. Her father once wrote in his newspaper column that Shannon was brilliant at math, good at science, a great athlete in any sport she tried, and a great writer too.

Her father had written about Shannon many times in his newspaper column. He often joked with his readers that she was “the world’s best kid.” Many readers wrote back to him after reading these columns to say that they agreed with him or made a similar comment about their own child.

Shannon knew she wanted to do something creative with her life, but she still had not decided between teaching and writing. Shannon didn’t think it would be easy to find out which job would fit her style best because it might take several years before she could become a successful writer in the real world.

She had read books by famous writers like John Updike, and thought that they were amazing writers compared to people like herself. She hoped that she could become a good writer, but after reading their books",0
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"however, there was an old dilapidated swing-set that had seen better days. He walked back over to his phone and dialed Jeremy’s number.
 Jeremy answered after two rings. “Hey man, what’s up?”
 “I can see you right now. Can you see me?” Gabriel asked as he peeked around the corner of his apartment.
 Jeremy laughed on the other end of the line, “Of course. We can see everything through these windows and doors. You can see us, we can see you, and we can even smell what you are cooking for dinner every now and then.”
 “How is it there?”
 “It’s great man, we are loving it. We threw a big barbecue over there last night to welcome ourselves to the neighborhood,” Jeremy said as he laughed heartily at his own joke. “See you later man, gotta run. I have a meeting in fifteen minutes and I’m already late as it is. Talk to you later man, bye!”
 “Bye Jeremy!” Gabriel said as he put his phone down and walked over to the kitchen. He grabbed two plates and cutlery sets before walking back into his room and calling out to Julio.
 “Dinner is ready!” he called out.
 Julio was sitting on the couch reading a brand-new copy of Gabriel García Márquez’s 100 Years of Solitude when Gabriel entered the room. He closed his book and stood up before smiling at Gabriel as he sat down on the couch next to him.
 “Thank you son,” Julio said as he patted Gabriel’s hand. “I am very hungry, what did you cook for us?”
 “Pasta with meatballs and a side of garlic bread,” Gabriel said as he walked toward the kitchen and served himself before returning to sit down next to his father. “So, how are you settling in? You haven’t been out of the apartment much since moving in yesterday.”
 “It is going very well and I am very happy here. I have been sleeping quite comfortably for the most part, although I did not like having to sleep alone last night,” Julio said as he started eating his portion of pasta.
 “You can sleep with me tonight if you like, Dad.”
 “No thank you. That is not a problem for me,” Julio said as he took another forkful of pasta in his mouth and began chewing it slowly. “I have missed being able to talk so much with you over the last few years, Gabriel. It seems so strange to finally be able to do that again and about whatever we choose to discuss.”
 “I have missed it too, Dad, I really have,” Gabriel said before he began eating the pasta on his own plate. “So tell me what is going on in your life at the moment; I haven’t heard much from you since I got here.”
After a pause, Julio answered him. “Well, for one thing my acting career has taken off in the past two years since your mother and brother left me. I have been offered a lot of work over that period, both in film and on the stage.”
As he ate his pasta, Gabriel listened intently to everything that Julio was saying to him about his acting career. He could not help but wonder what had motivated his father to ask him to help him move into the apartment so that he could be closer to his daughter and grandchild.
“I am also directing one of the plays myself as well,” Julio continued, “called The Merchant of Venice. You will probably recall that it is the famous story about Shylock who wants a pound of flesh if he doesn’t get his money back from Antonio; it is a role I am very excited to be playing. I have made some wonderful contacts in the theater in Los Angeles and I am hoping that some of them will allow me to direct other plays for them soon.”
Julio then told Gabriel about a couple of other theater projects that he was involved in at the moment, as well as some films and TV programs that were being shot in South America. Even though Julio had been an actor for many years, it still seemed incredible to Gabriel that he was now directing one of the greatest plays ever written in history.
“It is very exciting for me Gabriel, it really is. I know that you are very excited too; your mother and I have always wanted you to become a writer too when you grew up,” Julio said. He was beginning to get concerned about having his son moving away from home and decided that it would be a good idea for him to spend some time with him before he left.
“I am sure that we can have a great time together, can’t we?” Julio asked.
Gabriel thought about this for a while and realized that he was actually looking forward to spending time with his father. At the same time, he didn’t want to neglect his new opportunities either.
“I suppose so, but there are some things that I have to do too, like get some furniture and other things for the apartment. There is a furniture store close to your apartment building, so I will probably go over there tomorrow afternoon,” Gabriel told Julio.
“I am sure that you can do whatever you want during the day, but I will be busy with rehearsals all day until 7:00 at night,” Julio explained.
“Is there not another time when we can arrange to meet up that will suit both of us? I don’t want us to miss out on time together because of scheduling conflicts,” Gabriel said.
He was hoping that Julio would agree to some other time, so that he and Rich could see each other as well. He didn’t think that he had spoken to his friend for a few days now.
“Well, I suppose we can meet up tomorrow evening after my rehearsal. I will come over to your apartment at around 8:00 and we can go out for dinner or something,” Julio said.
“That sounds great, I will see you tomorrow then,” Gabriel said as he got up to leave.
He was glad that they had been able to work something out and he was looking forward to spending some time with his father.",0
"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","Jenna Riley stood in the doorway of her family’s blue bungalow, sipping on a cold glass of milk. The air was warm and humid, and Jenna felt heavy in the muggy heat. She had worked the midnight shift at the diner all night long, and it was now four in the morning. Jenna was exhausted from working, and she wished that she could go home to her apartment soon. She passed a few other people on the sidewalk on her way home. They all wore clothes that were too warm for how humid it was outside that early in the morning. Jenna stopped to chat with one of her coworkers. Jenna wished that she worked during the day shift, like him. It would be easier on her body and easier for her to do errands during the day, rather than at night. She would have to wait until after ten thirty before she could go home and rest. She had time for a quick nap  before she had to leave for work again.

Jenna was carrying a big brown bag of books in one hand and her keys in the other as she walked down the street. She stopped to look at a flyer about a community event. As she was looking through the pages, someone grabbed her shoulder and spun her around behind her. The mugger pressed his hand over her mouth and pulled out a gun.

“Do anything stupid,” he warned, “and I’ll shoot you in the head and leave you in this alley, just like your friend.”

He was talking about the poor girl who had been found murdered in the alley behind the diner a few weeks ago. Jenna had often walked through that same alley on her way home from work. She wished that she hadn’t been too tired this morning to walk a different route.

Jenna tried to scream, but the mugger clamped his hand tighter over her mouth. When he let go of her shoulder, Jenna took advantage and ran for the doors of the library across the street. There were several people inside, working on their laptops or sitting in cozy chairs reading magazines.

“Help!” Jenna shouted, but the people either looked up from their work or kept reading. No one bothered to come out and help her.

The mugger ran up to her, grabbed at the bag of books she was holding, and screamed, “Give me your stupid books! Now!”

Jenna dropped the plastic-wrapped books, but the mugger tripped on his own feet, allowing Jenna to escape. As he stood up, he pulled out a gun and pointed it at Jenna.

Jenna knew that she couldn’t outrun him.

“Get over here or I’ll blow your brains out,” the mugger barked.

Jenna stepped closer to the man, giving him no other choice but to pull the trigger. When a shot rang out, Jenna instinctively ducked and found herself on the ground. It felt like her cheek was burning, but she couldn’t be sure.

The mugger laughed and knelt down next to her. “You made it easy for me, bitch,” he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette lighter. He looked down at Jenna  and smiled. “When I’m done with you, you won’t be able to walk home from your shift at the diner anymore.”

The mugger stood up and ignited the lighter. Jenna closed her eyes and felt a sharp pain in her face as the mugger pressed the hot end of the lighter against Jenna’s cheek. She heard a sizzle and when she opened her eyes, she saw the mugger staring at her.

Jenna sat up and coughed, blood spewing out of her mouth. She looked around and saw the mugger lighting another cigarette;  he was still sitting on the ground next to her. Jenna screamed as loud as she could and lunged forward at the mugger, knocking him off balance. The mugger fell backwards and screamed in pain as he fell onto some broken glass.

Jenna stood up, but was too weak to get very far. She stumbled to the other side of the alley and collapsed against a wall. She looked down at her hands and saw that they were covered in blood. Her shirt was also stained with blood, and she could feel it slowly seeping into her jeans.

The mugger got back to his feet and turned around; he was holding the lighter as if preparing for another attack. Jenna’s vision started to go dark, and she stumbled forward, trying to reach the diner. She reached her arms out as if to brace herself against the wall, but all she hit were cold bricks.

Jenna then felt a sharp sting in her side; she looked down and saw that she was bleeding profusely. She slowly sank to the ground, and began coughing up more blood. The mugger walked out of the alley after he saw that Jenna was lying motionless on the ground. He picked up his sunglasses from the ground and put them back on his face.

Jenna suddenly came to, and forced herself onto her knees. She heard sirens just outside the alley, and tried to crawl in the direction of the diner’s entrance. It was hard going, but she managed to make it to the door. She was about to use her hands to open it when she realized that her hand was completely covered in blood.

She then heard a voice, “It’s okay, just lean on me.” When she looked up, Damian Henchman was helping Jenna out behind the diner. Jenna coughed and spat out some blood onto the ground. She began coughing again, and then collapsed on the ground.

Jenna came to again, and this time, she found herself in a white-walled hospital room with a man in his mid twenties standing at her bedside. Jenna looked up at him, and noticed that he had long blond hair and blue eyes. His face was covered with deep, red scars. He wore a white shirt and pants that were tucked into black combat boots. He was holding Jenna’s hand, and stared back at her.",1
Julia finally learns the truth about the visions.,"comic book and read it.

	As Julia was reading the comic book, she started to feel really uneasy so she put it down and went out of her bedroom. She walked down the stairs as quietly as she could and then continued in a straight line towards Thelma’s bedroom because she knew that there was someone in there that might be able to help her cope with her hallucinations. She stopped at the front door and listened, trying to make out what was making all the noise. She tried listening for a moment with one ear before putting both ears back in place so that she could hear properly. Then she heard it: the sound of a chainsaw being turned on and off again, then a brief moment of silence before it started up again. Julia walked slowly towards Thelma’s bedroom door with her hands fidgeting with her hair. She took deep breaths to calm herself down but then she started stuttering again, so she stopped in the middle of the hallway and put both hands across her mouth so that she could try to stop herself from stuttering and crying out.

	As Julia was about three feet away from Thelma’s bedroom door, she paused again for a moment to listen but the chainsaw noises were suddenlystopped. Then she heard the sounds of a woman yelling “HELP ME!” over and over again.

Julia took a deep breath and tried to calm herself down, but as soon as she was close enough, she heard the sound of Thelma’s bedroom door being kicked open and a chain saw being turned on. Julia took another deep breath as she braced herself for what would happen next. She slowly opened the door and saw that no one was in the room except for Thelma. Her head was lying on its side on the floor by the bed and blood had begun to pool around her head. Thelma’s feet were sticking out from underneath the covers at one end of the bed, but there weren’t any feet on the other side of it.

	Julia became frightened and started to back away towards her bedroom door, but then she heard a loud thud coming from Thelma’s body as if someone had kicked it. Julia became even more frightened and ran back into her own bedroom.

	She shut her bedroom door tightly and took a deep breath again, trying to calm herself down as she listened to the sound of Thelma’s body beinghit again and again with a blunt object.

	At that point, Julia was so frightened that she didn’t think that she could take another second of it. She ran back out of her bedroom and down the stairs, out of the house, and into the woods before she felt safe enough to take another deep breath.

	It was dark outside, but Julia could make out the outlines of trees all around her. She didn’t know where to go, so she just started walking deeper and deeper into the woods. She kept going until her legs were too tired for her to walk any further. She sat down on a log nearby and leaned back against it, breathing heavily as she tried to regain control of herself. She closed her eyes and began to think about that night’s events as calmly as she could, but then all of the memories from the night before came back to her in a rush and she started crying uncontrollably.

	Julia continued crying until she calmed down enough so that she was able to take another deep breath and start thinking about what was happening with her. She came to the conclusion that it must be some sort of mental illness, but one that only affected her when she slept. She didn’t knowwhat to do about it, though. At least she had the thought that it only happened while she slept to comfort her. Then she fell asleep again, hoping that whatever was happening to her wouldn’t happen again tonight and hoping that if it did, that it wouldn’t cause her any physical harm.

	The next day, Julia woke up early and went to visit Thelma Bates at the hospital. She was so worried about Thelma that she forgot all about her own visions for a while. When Julia got to the hospital, though, she learned that Thelma had died during the night from a stroke caused by a heart attack.

	Julia was shocked and horrified to learn that Thelma had died so suddenly and unexpectedly. She felt guilty about it for a while, even though she knew that there was nothing that anyone could have done to save her. Julia went home after visiting the hospital and spent the rest of the day in bed, trying to keep her mind off of what had happened.

	Later that night while Julia was sleeping, something happened that made her question whether or not her visions were caused by some sort of mental illness or if they were something else entirely. While Julia slept, Mary walked into Thelma’s room. She grabbed a chainsaw and started running the saw over and over again until its motor quit working all together. Just as she went to turn it on for the sixth time, something caught her eye in the corner of the room. She looked up to see a thin dark shadow that seemed to be standing directly over Thelma’s bed. It stood there for a moment looking over Thelma’s unmoving body and then slowly disappeared into thin air.

	Mary’s vision only ended when she woke up screaming from her own bed a short while later. She got up out of bed, but decided that it would be better if she didn’t tell Julia what she had seen at the hospital that night.

	The next day, Julia decided that she wanted to speak with Karen Jones about what had happened at the hospital the night before. Karen was a teenager who lived in the same apartment complex as Julia and she was always friendly when she saw Julia out on one of her walks around town. She agreed to meet with Julia that evening, but only if it was in a public place; she didn’t want to get involved with any of the visions or hauntings that were taking place in town. comic book and read it.

Jenna wakes up in the hospital a week later to find that she is now a vampire.,"“How long have I been out?” Jenna asked.

“A week. You just regained consciousness about ten minutes ago.”

Jenna smiled weakly and then looked around the room again. She noticed a brown door to her right that was labeled ‘Restroom’. There was also a window next to it. She noticed the lights were dim, but they were on, which made it brighter than the hospital rooms she had seen before. There were no medical instruments on the bed stand next to her, and there were no wires or tubes connected to her body. She moved her legs and realized that she had no casts on them.

“Where am I?” Jenna asked.

“You are in the hospital,” the blond man said. He sounded surprised by the question.

Jenna sat up and started rubbing her neck. “My neck hurts,” she said.

The blond man moved his hand away from Jenna’s and helped her sit up on the bed. She leaned back on the pillow, which was white with blue trim. As she moved, it moved to help steady her body.

“Where am I?” Jenna asked again.

“You were brought here a few minutes ago after being stabbed by a mugger,” the blond man explained patiently. “I am Dr. Damian Henchman, and I have been here to make sure that you recover.”

Jenna moved her other hand to her abdomen and felt a thin bandage covering her wound. She moved the bandage and saw a red line where the wound had been.

“Why am I in hospital?” she asked slowly.

“Because the hospital is the best place for you right now,” Dr. Henchman answered with a smile. “You are going to be fine. You have healed quickly, and you should leave here soon to go back home.”

“Home?” Jenna asked, as realization started to settle in.

Dr. Henchman answered before she could continue. “Yes, home. You have moved from the world of the living into the world of the dead. You will be one of us now, and you will  not age again. You are like me now, and I will help you to adjust to your new life, but we must hurry because we do not want anyone to learn about your situation before you leave here.”

“How long have I been here?” Jenna asked again.

“You have been here for a week, and the doctors have said that you have recovered nicely, but we will take your word for it,” he said with a smile. “Now, we need to begin your transformation into a vampire. Can you stand up so that I can explain the transformation process?”

Jenna tried to stand, but her legs were weak and she had difficulty balancing. She could feel powerful muscles in her legs beneath the bandages that covered them, and she discovered that she now had superhuman strength in addition to her new enhanced speed and agility. She turned sideways so that she now had a wide stance and was able to balance better.

Jenna turned her head to look directly at Dr. Henchman. “How? How can turning into a vampire be possible? How do I know that you are telling me the truth?” Jenna now realized that she could run much faster than Dr. Henchman could ever hope to run, and she turned to run from him while calling out, “I have superhuman strength and speed!” as she raced into the far corner of her hospital room. 

Dr. Henchman ran after her, but Jenna was just too fast for him. She leapt out of her hospital bed with superhuman strength and landed in a crouch in front of Liam’s bed, which was now empty because he had been moved to another wing of the hospital. She turned around and saw Liam cross the second floor balcony. He leapt off the balcony with superhuman speed and landed three stories below on a nearby car in one smooth motion. He turned to face Jenna and said, “Trust me. There is life after death!”

Jenna was starting to catch on to the new rules of her new world, but she wasn’t quite ready to let Liam Cross back into her life. She had been living on her own for a while now, and she could take care of herself. Jenna was still adjusting to all of the changes that had taken place in her life, and she needed time adjust to this latest development before she could try to make sense of it.

Jenna decided that she would let Liam Cross try to talk her into it after she had a little more time to think about everything. She would let him explain what had happened, and then she would make up her own mind about what she should do. Jenna had been living in survival mode for the last week. She was finally beginning to come down from her adrenaline rush now that she was out of danger. She needed some time to adjust, and then she would decide if Liam Cross could be trusted or not. She decided that Liam Cross would have to adjust to her reality, because she wasn’t adjusting to his.

Jenna started slowly backing up through the hospital. “Have you figured out how to change back yet?” asked Jenna. “I think so,” replied Liam. “Change back right now! ” said Jenna. She was very scared of vampires, and she was worried that Liam wasn’t really who he claimed to be. She wanted to see if he responded the way that a scared human would respond, or if he would do something inhuman like sprout fangs and hiss at her.

Liam Cross didn’t show any reaction. “Jenna, I haven’t always been a vampire. I was once just like you,” said Liam. He smiled at her and took a few steps toward her. “I was born human, just like you were, and I worked in a bookshop. I used to go to movies and watch football on Sunday afternoons with my family,” said Liam.

“If you don’t change back right now, I am going to scream so loud that everyone in this building is going to hear it!” said Jenna. She was clearly getting more panicked.

Liam took another couple steps toward her, smiling the whole time. “I know what you are thinking right now,” said Liam. He gave her a reassuring look. “You are wondering why I haven’t attacked you yet. You probably think that you are going to end up like those people on the internet who get their throats ripped out by vampires,” said Liam.

Jenna didn’t say anything. She just looked at him.

“I promise that I won’t hurt you,” said Liam. “I want to be your friend. That’s why you need to listen to me. There is a group of vampires in Shepherdstown known as The True Cross, and they are responsible for creating me and many other vampires. I also want to tell you that your attacker was probably one of them. You need to find out who did this to you,” said Liam.

Jenna opened and closed her mouth a few times without saying anything. She must have been thinking about what Liam had just said, because she finally spoke up again. “I don’t understand any of this,” said Jenna.

Liam gave her another sympathetic look. “What questions do you have? I promise that if you ask me anything at all about this, I will answer it to the best of my ability,” said Liam.",1
Gabriel moves out of his parents' house and into his own apartment.,"The year was 2009, and Gabriel Martin had just turned twenty-two. He
had his whole life ahead of him, but he didn’t know what to do with it.
He was a man now, so he had to go out and get his own place. His mom was
proud of him and wanted to be proud of him when he moved out. She loved
him very much, and she knew that one day he would be the most handsome
man in the world. She said that God had big plans for him, and he
shouldn’t give up on them just yet. She knew Gabriel would be a star one
day, or at least do something special. He was a cool dude who had his own
style and knew what he wanted out of life. Gabriel was going to be a
father soon, but that didn’t scare him one bit. He was ready to be a man
and take care of his family.

   Gabriel had thought he would live with his friends forever, but now
that they have apartments, and friends are married, he needed to move out
and find a place of his own. It was a big step in his life, but he knewit was the right one. His friends helped him pick out a few places to look
at. They loved Gabriel so much, and knew that he could take care of himself.
They were all concerned about him living on his own, but they all trusted
that he could do it. They said that they would help him move into his new
apartment and even go grocery shopping for him. That made him feel so good
to know that he had such great friends.

   He looked at about three apartments before deciding which one to live
in. There were some nice ones and some not so nice ones, but he liked the
one he picked out the most. The place was large enough for him to live in,
and it wasn’t too expensive for him to pay rent on. He loved that there was
a park nearby where he could go sit and relax when he needed some alone
time. He loved the quietness of it, and he knew that when his mom came to
visit him she would love the place too. She wouldn’t have to worry about
him after he moved out because this place seemed so peaceful and safe.

   There weren’t any places available that dayto move into, but
he was determined to get into one of the apartments. So, his friends helped
him move in by carrying his stuff up all those steps. The place was empty
so they didn’t have to worry about moving things over and finding a place
for them. Then they went grocery shopping for him so that he would have a
few things to eat for a couple of days until he got paid. They were so nice
to him, and he knew that they would always be there for him no matter what.

   He sat down on his couch and took in all the sights and sounds of his
new place. He loved it! The only thing missing was his mom who had come to
see him earlier that day and helped set up the apartment a little bit. She
had brought over some food from his grandma’s house for him to eat while he
set up everything else. His grandma had gone with her to help him move all
of his stuff in, and then took her back home. Gabriel really missed them,
and he couldn’t wait to tell them how much he loved his new place.

   It was late at night when he saw the note on his door. He smiled as he held
up the note as if it were some kind of trophy. He had told his friends not
to bring any girls over while he was setting up. He wanted to have no
distractions while unpacking and arranging everything. He didn’t want to be
asked any questions about this or that, or why did they move something
where it didn’t seem right. He knew what he had done to make his new home
a nice and comfortable place for him.

   So, he walked outside and read the note left by Jeremy for him. It just
said “congratulations buddy!”

   Gabriel ran back inside and grabbed his phone. He called Jeremy who was
already in bed with a girl so it went straight to voicemail. He called
Angelica who also had already gone out when she got off work but she was
too tired and fell asleep right after talking to him so her phone went
straight to voicemail too.He called Richie who was at the club still and
was planning to stay there so he didn’t pick up. He called Julio but his
phone went just as straight to voicemail as the rest of them did.

   The next day, Gabriel felt lonely and didn’t know what to do with
himself. Julio was out on a delivery trip until that evening so no matter
how many times Gabriel tried calling him, he knew it was useless. He would
have to wait until tonight to hear from his father and that made him sad.

   Gabriel was going through his closet trying to think of what he could do
with himself when the doorbell rang. He opened the door expecting one of his
friends but he found Julio standing outside in a suit carrying a couple of
bags full of food in his hands. Julio was covered with dirt and gasoline.

   “Good morning Gabriel,” he said as he put the bags on Gabriel’s couch.
He walked over to the kitchen and grabbed a paper towel that was hanging on
the wall next to the sink to wipe his hands. He looked at Gabriel’s empty
fridge and said “Let’s go",0
Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"monster forever, right?”

Gregory nodded and stroked her hair lovingly. “It will all be over soon, Jenna. I promise.”

Jenna closed her eyes tightly and tried to calm down. She took deep, ragged breaths as she tried not to break down in front of him. She was a warrior and she had to keep calm. She opened her eyes and stared at him for a moment before asking, “Is there anything I can do for now? Do they have any clothes that I can wear?”

He nodded but said nothing else as he went into his bedroom and started rooting around in one of the drawers. He came back out with a pair of jeans for Jenna to wear and gave them to her. He then took one of his shirts from his closet and gave it to her as well.

	Jenna changed into the clothes, but they were too baggy on her body and fell off of her when she tried to button them up. “Can you help me with these?” she asked him.

He nodded and took the jeans from her hands before starting to button them up for her. He slid his hands all the way up towards her hipsand smiled at her as he worked on fastening the buttons. “You look very nice in my clothes,” he told her as he finished with the buttons.

	Jenna smiled at him and told him, “Thank you…for everything.”

	Gregory smiled back at her before he went into the kitchen and grabbed a pair of shoes for her to wear. He brought them to her and said, “Put these on when you’re done.”

Jenna slipped on the shoes and felt a wave of relief wash over her when Gregory told her that he wanted to keep her in his house for a while longer so that no one else could find her. She would have been mortified if any of her friends had found out what happened to her, seeing as she had told them all that she was going out with one of her friends, but instead she was kidnapped and ended up a vampire.

	Jenna took a deep breath before asking Gregory, “Could you take me somewhere? I need some information on where to go next.”

	Gregory looked taken aback by what she had said and asked, “What do you mean?”Jenna answered him, “I’m looking for my attacker. Do you know who they were? What clan it was? There’s so many things I don’t know yet. I need to find the answer to those questions before I can move forward with my life.”

	Gregory stared at her and thought about telling her that he already knew who her attacker was, but he decided against it because he couldn’t be certain it would be the same person that she was thinking of. Gregory told her instead, “You should go to the castle as soon as possible; they will help you get on your feet again. They will also help you locate your attacker so that you may have them punished for what they did to you.”

	Jenna nodded and said, “Okay then…I’ll go there as soon as I can. Thank you for the information Gregory. You’ve been very helpful. You don’t know how much this means to me.”

	Gregory smiled at her because he was happy that he could help her out after all she had been through. He also found himself strangely attracted to her; it was something that hehadn’t felt in a very long time. He had lost his wife many years ago and hadn’t dated anyone since. Now here was Jenna, a beautiful young woman with soft brown hair, deep blue eyes, and pale skin. She had the body of a goddess and Gregory couldn’t help but picture her naked in his bed.

	As Gregory watched Jenna walk out of the room his thoughts began to wander as he wondered what it would be like to take her into his arms and kiss her softly. He felt himself becoming aroused and he decided that it would be best if he went downstairs and waited for her in the living room rather than risk doing something inappropriate around her. He began to wonder why he hadn’t noticed how attractive this young woman was before; she was a vision of loveliness.

	Jenna exited Gregory’s house and headed towards the bus stop at the end of the block. Her body ached in several places due to her injuries, but she knew that they would heal quickly enough with a little bit of blood. All that really mattered to her was finding out where her attacker was so she could have them punished for what they had done to her. She reached into her purse and took out themoney Gregory had given her. It was a nice change from being poor after all, but she knew that she would need to figure out how to get more money soon. She decided that she would go shopping tomorrow and buy some food before going home.

	Jenna arrived at the bus stop and waited for the next bus to arrive. The bus ride was short and it took Jenna a total of fifteen minutes before she arrived at the castle from Gregory’s house.

	Jenna paid for her entry fee and headed towards the entrance of the castle. She passed by several people who were chatting amongst themselves as they walked through a door that led to a basement bar. There didn’t appear to be any sign of her attacker, but she would have to look around at the different tables in just a moment to make sure. She stopped suddenly when she spotted Liam sitting at a table close by. He appeared very calm as he sat alone eating a plate of food. Jenna smiled when she saw him, but he did not seem to notice her which worried her slightly. She decided that it was best to walk over and talk to him while she had the chance. She took a seat across from him and looked at him with a questioning look on her face.",0
"When Natalie arrives at the address Trevor gave her, she quickly realizes that something isn't right and that Trevor might be a dangerous man .","now that they were in the same room together. Natalie Harper took a sip of her wine and smiled at Trevor Lockwood for a few seconds before answering his question. She told him that she had some ideas and he nodded his head at her.

Natalie Harper told Trevor Lockwood that she wanted to undress him, and kiss his body as he did the same to her. To add a little more excitement to the situation, she told Trevor Lockwood that they could include some foreplay with their clothes on as well.

Trevor Lockwood was flattered by Natalie Harper’s forward reply and he moved closer to her on the couch. He moved his hand up the inside of Natalie Harper’s thigh and touched her crotch several times before stopping.

Natalie Harper leaned in to kiss Trevor Lockwood, but he pulled away from her instead. He explained to Natalie Harper that he still had some questions to ask her before moving forward with their plan.

Trevor Lockwood moved his hand up Natalie Harper’s skirt and he felt her underwear. He moved his fingers back and forth several times before stopping to talk again.

Natalie Harper was now moving her head back and forth to keep eye contact with Trevor Lockwood. She moved her legs into a more open position so that Trevor Lockwood could have easier access to her panties. She wanted him to move his hand inside of them, but she was going to have to wait a few more minutes before he did.

Trevor Lockwood moved his other hand up Natalie Harper’s stomach and he gently massaged her breasts through her top. He moved his fingers in a small circular pattern before stopping to talk again.

There was a small white hotel in the middle of nowhere about an hour from Trevor Lockwood’s small town, a hotel where no one ever went anymore. It would be the perfect place for them to stay in order to get everything they needed done on time.

Trevor Lockwood moved his hands down from Natalie Harper’s breasts and started unbuttoning her shirt. He pushed the small cotton fabric aside and moved his hands underneath of them to touch her bare breasts.

Natalie Harper was moving completely out of her comfort zone by agreeing to an in-person meeting with Trevor Lockwood. She was moving further out of it as he moved his hands all over her body, especially when she  could feel his hard cock against her crotch through their clothes.

Trevor Lockwood touched the soft skin without restraint and Natalie Harper held her breath as he squeezed her large breasts in his hands. He then moved his lips to the area above one of them and kissed the tender skin there.

Natalie Harper was already feeling turned on by Trevor Lockwood and she knew that when he felt her bare breasts, his arousal would increase. She was a little surprised at how turned on she was herself, considering how nervous she felt as Trevor Lockwood was undressing her. 

Trevor Lockwood parted Natalie Harper’s thighs with his hands as he began to suck on one of her large breasts. After a few seconds, Natalie felt him move closer to her and she knew what was coming next.

The part of Natalie Harper that was not turned on by this situation was kicking in as Trevor Lockwood spread her legs and buried his face between them. Natalie began to feel a little nervous about the situation. She had never let anyone do that before, not even herself.

Trevor Lockwood began to kiss the soft skin of Natalie Harper’s inner thighs and she felt her knees grow weak as he licked the area between her legs. Natalie Harper felt her nerves give way to desire as Trevor Lockwood touched her most intimate areas. She began to think about what he was doing and why, and she felt a little uncomfortable that she was so turned on by it all. Trevor Lock wood found this amusing and continued to lick Natalie Harper’s pussy.

Natalie Harper was beginning to panic as she thought about what Trevor Lockwood was doing between her legs. He had not even touched her pussy yet and she could already feel the strong sensations emanating from it. It occurred to Natalie that Trevor Lockwood might have done this before and that he might be very good at it. Natalie Harper grew more and more nervous as the minutes passed, but she could only focus on what was happening to her body.

Natalie Harper felt as if she were going crazy. She wanted to stop what was happening, but  her body told her otherwise. She knew that it was “wrong” to let a stranger do this to her and she knew that she should get up and leave, but something inside of her would not allow her to do so.

She didn’t hear from Trevor after that, and Natalie began",1
Kyle comforts Aimee and the two share a heart-to-heart conversation that leaves Aimee feeling understood for the first time.,"on the table, “I really appreciate you guys inviting me. I’m really looking forward to spending more time with you guys. I can tell you both have a lot of wisdom to offer, and I know that if I can just learn a little bit from you, it would make me a better person.”

	Patricia laughed. “You’re too kind, Aimee. And we are very happy to have you in our lives. But the truth is that we learn just as much from you as you will learn from us. It works out for the best, I think...”

	Aimee could see in Patricia’s eyes that she was trying to convince herself and not Aimee. But it worked anyway because Aimee felt reassured and at ease, as if she had always belonged there with them. She didn’t know why she had believed Patricia when she had denied it earlier, but maybe it was because of the look in her eyes or the way she spoke about Kyle...

	…Kyle. Aimee didn’t understand how she could be so close to someone and yet feel so far away from them. As friendly as they were, the three of themdidn’t become friends until Aimee met Kyle, and she felt that he was the only one who really knew her. But even though he seemed to care about her deeply, no matter how much she got to know him, she didn’t feel any closer to him than she did at the beginning.

	Aimee couldn’t help thinking about her dad’s death again. It always bothered her so much more at night, especially when everyone else was asleep. She felt like she was the only one awake in the whole world. Even though she knew it wasn’t true, it seemed like everyone else had gotten over his death and moved on with their lives but her.

	She thought about all the things she wanted to talk to Kyle about but never did for fear of burdening him with her problems. She didn’t want to burden anyone with her problems—not her therapist, not Patricia, and certainly not Kyle. She didn’t like it when others felt sorry for her, so she worked hard to keep up a happy façade. But that didn’t make the problem go away—it just made it worse.

	She felt so lonely sometimes that she thought if shedidn’t have Patricia or Kyle around all the time she might just die.

	Aimee was starting to think that maybe she would be better off without them. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to have them in her life, but maybe they were better off without her and she was better off without them. She realized it was inevitable that everyone would one day go their separate ways, and if this is what was meant to be, then so be it. It wouldn’t be the first time in her life that things had fallen apart—it wouldn’t even be the first time this year.

	Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. “Pizza delivery!” someone shouted after rattling the door knob.

	Aimee grabbed her wallet off the table by the door and opened it. The pizza delivery boy set down a large box on the floor in front of her and handed her a receipt.

	“Thank you!” she said, stepping out onto the porch to get the box.

	But instead of carrying it inside, she put it down on the ground and sat down next to it, leaning against the railing of the porch steps. Shestared out into the dark with a blank expression on her face. Her hands began to tremble, so she crossed her arms over her stomach and put her head down on them.

	Her thoughts began to return in a flood of memories that brought her to tears. She couldn’t figure out why she was crying—it was only pizza, after all—but the floodgates were open and there was no turning back.

	She cried for her father—the sense of loss welling up inside her as she thought about how he had died alone. She cried for the friends who had left her to go off to college without her and never returned, for the friends who started going out with each other and stopped hanging out with her at all. When it came right down to it, she cried for all of the loneliness that had ever been a part of her life—loneliness in school, loneliness at home—all of it came rushing back to her at once.

	Kyle, walking back outside because he forgot his keys, stopped in his tracks when he saw Aimee sitting there crying. He thought about going back inside and getting the box for her, but eventually decided against it as he watched her cry into her palms.He wouldn’t bother her—he knew how to be a good friend.

	When her tears subsided, she found herself looking at the pizza box lying on the ground beside her. She picked it up and looked at the writing on it. The name said “Kyle Johnson” and she remembered him from work; he worked over in accounting. He was tall, skinny, and had glasses that made his eyes look like two dots on his cheekbones. His hair was thin—the kind of hair that looked gray when it was wet and looked brown when it was dry. He wore a lot of black t-shirts that fit tight around his chest and jeans with large holes worn in them all over the knees.

	She turned the box over in her hands, so she could see what was on the back. It read “Aimee Kincaid likes pepperoni” and she giggled a little to herself. She felt bad for getting upset about nothing, but she wasn’t embarrassed by the fact that she had cried like a baby over nothing—it actually felt good to get everything out, even if it was just over a pizza box. She looked up and saw that Kyle was watching her intently from across thestreet. He must have seen her crying and felt bad, so he sent her a pizza. Aimee smiled and waved at him, and he smiled back before turning away and going back into his house.

Aimee realized that she had finally found someone who understand her—someone who knew how she felt, and didn’t judge her for it. She was finally able to be herself, without feeling like she had to put on a brave face all the time. Kyle had seen her at her worst and he still wanted to be friends, which meant more to Aimee than anything else in the world.",0
"Natalie Harper makes a deal with Trevor Lockwood, a man she met online, to meet him in person in exchange for money so that she can pay her rent .","Natalie Harper made small talk with Trevor Lockwood online for several months. She was attracted to his confidence and good looks, even though he was nearly twenty years her senior. She saw herself as a confident woman, but she lacked the courage to approach him in public, nor would she do so out of respect for her boyfriend. So Natalie Harper had turned to the internet, where she found Trevor Lockwood. He was interested in meeting her in person, if she had enough money for their date. Natalie Harper agreed and they set up a time and place to meet. Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what kind of man she would date. Natalie Harper said that she would go out with someone like Trevor Lockwood, although he was not much older than her. Natalie Harper asked Trevor Lockwood if he was married. He said he wasn’t and had no children. She asked him if he lived alone, and again, his answer was positive. Natalie Harper met Trevor Lockwood in a coffee shop on the second floor of a shopping center in East Sacramento. She asked him to meet her there, but she did not tell him why. She gave him the agreed-upon amount of money—five hundred dollars—which he assured her would be enough for their date . Trevor Lockwood then gave Natalie Harper an address in rural Northern California and told her to come there. Natalie Harper was aware of Trevor Lockwood’s offer prior to this meeting, but she just needed to talk with him face-to-face to make sure he really meant her no harm. Natalie Harper got  in her car and drove towards the area where Trevor Lockwood told her he lived. She turned off Interstate 80 and drove on the country roads that led into his neighborhood. The roads were isolated, but she had a small map with the directions that Trevor Lockwood had given her. Natalie Harper arrived at his home after driving for about an hour. It was a large house set on a hill, surrounded by forest land. Natalie Harper parked her car on the side of the road and walked up to the front door of the house. She knocked and was immediately greeted by Trevor Lockwood, who opened it with a key he retrieved from inside.  Natalie Harper stepped into the house and greeted Trevor Lockwood.

Trevor Lockwood was wearing a black short-sleeved shirt underneath a red cardigan sweater. His face was clean-shaven, except for a goatee that was trimmed close to his mouth. He had dark brown hair, short at the sides and about two inches long in the back. His eyes were blue and he gave off a strong and commanding presence to those he met. Trevor Lockwood was twenty-four years old and living with his parents in their five-bedroom house. He worked part-time at a small marketing firm in San Francisco, but his income was not very high. Trevor Lockwood invited Natalie Harper to sit down on the couch in his living room.

Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper how she liked driving up to his house. She said that she had enjoyed the drive, as it was quiet and peaceful. Trevor Lockwood moved to the edge of the couch and cleared a spot for Natalie Harper. Trevor Lockwood moved closer to Natalie Harper and sat down next to her.

Trevor Lockwood told Natalie Harper that he really enjoyed talking with her online and that he would have much preferred talking with her in person, but circumstances had prevented him from doing so. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand up to Natalie Harper’s shoulder.

Natalie Harper reached for Trevor Lockwood’s hand and placed it on her thigh. She looked at his lips and then smiled at him as she moved her head closer to his mouth. Trevor Lockwood moved his head away from her.

Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper if she had thought of any names for the business venture they were discussing. Trevor Lockwood explained that he had already thought of a name, but he was always willing to listen to suggestions from others. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand slowly up the inside of her thigh and moved it towards her crotch.

Natalie Harper moved Trevor Lockwood’s hand away. She was surprised that Trevor had touched her so soon in their conversation, as they still had so many details to discuss. She told Trevor Lockwood of two possible names that she wanted to consider, and Trevor Lockwood nodded his head.

Trevor Lockwood asked if he could move closer to Natalie Harper on the couch. Natalie Harper agreed and Trevor Lockwood moved next to her on the couch.

Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what she wanted him to do",1
"Shannon meets Luke, a young man who helps her with her second book.","“All right,” said Shannon, taking a sip from her glass of wine. “I’m done.”

She put the first draft of her book on the floor next to her nightstand and took out a piece of paper. She wrote a note to Abby and left it by the computer.

Shannon’s hand shook as she wrote Luke’s phone number on the paper. She set it on the desk next to her computer and picked up her glass of wine. Shannon decided to drink it all, even though she didn’t feel like it, to wash away the taste of failure. With a sigh, she put the glass to her lips. The heat from the wine burned her mouth and throat as it traveled down into her stomach.

“I should have gone dancing with Abby tonight,” she thought. “I should have gotten drunk and made out with some hot guy. That would have been more fun than sitting here, staring at a blank screen.”

It was a warm June evening out in Central Park. Shannon stood on the concrete path that led to the boathouse and leaned against the railing overlooking the water. She closed her eyes and moved her face closer to the sun.

Shannon opened her eyes. Below in the park, a couple passed by holding hands, moving slowly under the shade of trees. They were moving towards the boathouse where she stood leaning on the railing, just like she was doing now.

“Maybe I should move?” Shannon thought. “It will be less awkward if I move.”

She started to move but hesitated for a moment and stopped again. Then she decided that it wouldn’t be a big deal if she stayed there, so she continued leaning against the railing.

The couple moved closer to the boathouse and stopped in front of Shannon.

“Can we take a look at the view over here?” The man said.

“Sure,” Shannon replied. “Be careful though; it gets really slippery out here.”

The couple moved past Shannon and stood close to each other in front of the railing. Then they moved closer to each other and started hugging each other tightly.

“They are moving in for a kiss,” Shannon thought with a smile on her face. “Maybe  now I shouldn’t move after all. It would be nice to watch them kiss.”

She took a sip from the wine glass and heard footsteps coming towards her. She turned around to see Luke walking towards her.

“Hi, I’m Luke,” He said and smiled at her.

“I’m Shannon,” She replied and smiled back.

They shook hands briefly, but Luke soon realized that he should have offered his hand for longer than he did. So they shook hands again, this time for longer. Then they stopped at the coffee shop on the lakeside to have a cup of coffee.

“So, you moved out of your apartment. I hope you are doing ok?” Luke said as they sat down at a table.

“Yeah, I think it will be better to live somewhere else for a while now,” Shannon answered and moved her eyes to a group of three people who were passing them by.

There was a tall, dark-haired woman in the lead. She had moved to another table nearby, where two men were sitting. One was reading a newspaper and the other was drinking coffee from a cup with foam on top. The three of them looked happy together, as if they were enjoying the fact that everything was moving smoothly for them in that moment.

“Have a nice coffee,” The barista said loudly as he walked by. “Have a nice date…”

Shannon moved her eyes to the tall, dark-haired woman again. Shannon turned to Luke and said: “Maybe moving somewhere else will help me clear my head. Maybe I could go somewhere in Europe or Asia. Just move out of my apartment and away from here. Just to have some space for a change.”

“Moving to Europe? Asia? That sounds like a great idea. You should do it,” Luke answered with a wide smile on his face. “When do you want to go?”

“I don’t know yet, but I am moving out of my apartment,” she said.

“I will come over one of these days and help you move your stuff out of your apartment,” Luke said earnestly. “Where are you going to move to? Somewhere closer to work? Closer to school? Or somewhere  completely different?”

Shannon smiled back at him and took a sip of her latte. “I’ll tell you everything when I know myself, but I have to end this relationship first,” Shannon said.

The smile on Luke’s face faded and he asked Shannon, “What happened? Why is it over? What is going on? Things were going quite well for a while.”

Shannon took another sip of her latte. “Things were good for a bit, but I just can’t do this anymore. It was going so well… I started liking him and now I’m moving out of my apartment and thinking about moving to Europe or Asia. Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? What am I going to do there? What will I tell my parents? Or my agent for that matter? Or my best friend, who keeps telling me to move on?” Shannon paused and looked up at the ceiling. “This is just a stupid mistake. I’ve got to end it now before it gets worse—before I make an even bigger fool out of myself,” she said softly. “But I can’t move out tonight.”

Luke put his hand on Shannon’s and said, “Why not move in with me? You don’t have to decide anything tonight. Just give it some thought. Think about what you want to do and decide tomorrow. Why not move in with me for a few days and move your stuff into my place?”

Shannon gave the same reasons she gave her best friend for not moving in with Luke. Shannon was hesitant to let Luke know how serious she had gotten about him, but she knew that if she didn’t move in with him now it would be even more difficult to move on later.

In the apartment, Shannon decided that she wanted to move in with Luke, and so did he. That settled, they went off for pizza and beer and spent the rest of the evening discussing their lives. Shannon told Luke about her childhood, about living with her mother and moving around, about her father dying, and about the failed book.

The next day Shannon moved all of her stuff into Luke’s apartment. She put most of it in his bedroom, where his bed was already set up. She didn’t put his bed together. Instead, she  kept it separate, on some sheets in the middle of the room. She put a few books on his desk, and a few other things in the kitchen.

After Shannon moved her stuff into Luke’s apartment, they spent a lot of time together. Shannon spent long hours at Luke’s apartment, and they often went out together. Shannon’s second book started to take shape with Luke’s help. But the relationship between Shannon and Luke was also beginning to take shape.

Over the next few weeks, they grew closer. Their conversations became more revealing and intimate. The topics shifted from Shannon’s work to her personal life, and Luke told her about growing up in a small town, about his childhood friends and schoolmates. Luke confided in Shannon about his mother and his failed engagement.

The conversations helped both of them move forward with their lives, with Luke helping Shannon with her second book  and Shannon helping Luke to overcome his struggles with women. It was a turning point for both of them, and they were falling in love.

Shannon spent more time at Luke’s apartment than she did at her own place. She was also starting to care for him, and she wanted to spend more time with him.

But this love affair didn’t last long. While Shannon and Luke were falling in love, publishers were already showing interest in Shannon’s second manuscript. She had been a bit distracted while working on her first book, and the result was disappointing. But her second book was different. There wasn’t anything holding her back from getting published.

Publishers were still interested in Shannon’s first book, however. She was invited to meetings with editors at different publishing houses and asked to give them updates on how her second book was coming along. She promised them that she would be moving forward with the publication of her second book next month.

Publishers eventually offered Shannon a deal with one of their publishing houses, and she signed the contract right away.

Shannon moved in with Luke almost immediately after she started working on her second book, because it was close to her new office.",0
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"friends, and she had stopped taking part in the activities she used to enjoy doing in her spare time. Shannon was spending more time alone at home because her father didn’t seem interested in doing anything with her, and so it seemed as though she had no one else to turn to but herself. “She’s trying to cope with her loss, and I don’t think she’s learned to do that yet,” Uncle Jeff said.

Shannon was sitting on the edge of her bed, holding a box of oil paints that was given to her by her mother before she passed away from cancer. She started crying uncontrollably once again upon seeing both her uncle and father approach her room slowly. “What are you doing here?” Shannon asked, wiping the tears from her face and standing up. There were paint stains on her cheeks, nose and hands. Her uncle could see that she had been crying for a while.

“I came to talk to you,” her father said.

“About what?” Shannon asked, turning away from them. She started pacing around the room as she spoke. “You don’t care how I feel, so why should I tell you?” she asked.

Her father stepped inside the room and placed a hand on her shoulder. “I do care about how you feel daughter,” he said softly. Her uncle noticed that there were small tears forming in her father’s eyes.

“Yeah, right. If you did care, you wouldn’t have left us all behind to deal with this grief on our own,” she said, turning to face her father directly now. She looked in his eyes and saw that he had started crying now. “He doesn’t care.” She turned to face her uncle now. “You don’t care either, do you?”

Her uncle sighed and shook his head slowly. He did care, but he knew that she wouldn’t believe him just yet. “No, I do care Shannon,” he said gently.

She looked at him for a few moments while the tears continued to fall from her father’s eyes and then nodded and walked over to sit on her bed. The two men stood nearby, unsure of what to do next. Her father was crying now,  so he didn’t know how to handle this situation.

Shannon saw the box of oil paints on her nightstand. She picked it up and opened it slowly, letting the tears continue to stream down her face as she did so. She stared at the empty canvas in front of her for a few moments before she took out a large brush and dipped it into a small jar of red paint. Then, Shannon started to paint.

She started painting out of her own grief and loneliness, but as she worked, she found that somehow painting helped to ease it. She painted for hours and didn’t eat anything. Shannon’s need to paint became so strong that she decided to clear out her attic and turn it into a studio, so that she could paint there whenever she felt like it.

She turned her old wooden desk into a workbench and filled the walls with canvases, paints, brushes, and other painting materials. Shannon moved her easel to the center of the room and placed two chairs in front of it. She hung some potted plants in the corners of the room for decoration purposes. The attic was small, but she didn’t mind that. It was just right for her. It also reminded  her of the attic in the family’s old barn.

Shannon would spend hours in the studio, painting and listening to music on her headphones. She discovered that drawing people helped her to feel connected with her mother once more, and so she would draw portraits of her mother over and over again. The  act of drawing also helped Shannon to cope with her feelings.

Shannon started to put her own feelings into the paintings, too. She could often be found staring at one of her own unfinished paintings, which had two figures standing in a meadow. The figures were very dark and pale, reflecting Shannon’s feelings of being filled with darkness but also feeling a glimmer of light at the same time.

This painting became an outlet for Shannon and she would often sit and stare at it for long periods of time to try to work some of her pain and confusion out on it. Sometimes, she would cover the painted surface with salt and trace the outlines of her paintings in a faint blue wash. This felt like she was connecting with someone, especially since her own mother could no longer speak to her. Shannon felt as if she were having a conversation with her mother by painting the images over and over again. Shannon started to feel closer to her paintings and knew that they helped her to heal.

Shannon painted for hours every day, with only a short break for lunch which she always ate while standing up. She drank a lot of water so that she wouldn’t feel weak or tired. She felt almost as peaceful as when she was painting and felt that it was her therapy. Shannon painted every night until she finished a painting, and then she would start a new one. Sometimes, she would paint for six hours straight without stopping, and this helped to ease the pain in her heart. Sometimes, while painting, Shannon felt like",1
The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"that she would be more inclined to fight the cancer.

	Today, though, Lisa could feel a headache coming on; she had been working non-stop on the project for Mr. Simpson’s class for over a week and it was finally starting to catch up with her.

	She wanted nothing more than to lie down and take a nap; but she didn’t want to miss out on any of the time she had left with Daisy, so she decided that she would push through it and go to school anyway.

	The headache got worse as the day went on, but she managed to force herself to get through all of her classes in spite of it. When the last bell rang, she couldn’t wait to go home and sleep; but again, she felt guilty about leaving her mom alone.

	Still, there was no way that she could have stayed awake another minute; so she set her books down on her desk in the front of the classroom and went back to her locker to put away her books.

	The hallways were practically deserted; only a few other students were still roaming the halls, and none of them happened to be heading in the direction of Lisa’s locker.She put her books away as quickly as she could and then hurried to her car like a woman possessed. She just wanted to get home to see Daisy; she did not want to be anywhere else right now.

	As soon as Lisa got into the driver’s seat, she felt an overwhelming sense of relief wash over her; but it was shattered by the sight she saw when she got out of her car: a crowd of people surrounding Daisy’s old jalopy, which was parked in front of the Simpson house.

	Lisa approached cautiously, trying to see who was standing around her mother’s car; but by the time she got close enough to identify them, Daisy had already gotten into her own car and driven off. All that was left were a few empty beer cans and a cigarette lying on the ground.

	Lisa couldn’t believe it; she had been so busy with school and work that she forgot it was Friday; it must have been some kind of party that they were having at the diner today.

	She knew that Daisy had been going out alone a lot recently because she didn’t want Maggie to get sick from being exposed to all of the germs at the hospital; but hermother was usually well-rested and alert when she came back, so Lisa thought that she must be in good health.

	Lisa slowly approached the gathering and was surprised to see that almost everyone she knew was there: Mr. Simpson, Evelyn, Joe and Tanya Swanson, Patty and Selma Bouvier, Mary-Lee Johnston, Herb Powell… She suddenly realized that Daisy’s cancer was a town secret and wondered how long it had been before they had invited her to join their group.

	In fact, this secret is shared by almost everyone in Mayberry because Daisy did not want anyone to worry about her or feel sorry for her. In fact, she never wanted anyone to know about it. But lately, she seemed to be less concerned about covering up her condition and was therefore more inclined to spend time outside with her friends.

	Finally, the group dispersed and Lisa found herself alone in front of Daisy’s old jalopy. She looked down at the cigarette butt on the ground and then up at her house. She needed to get inside, so she could go back into her room and check on Daisy.

	Even though it was only four o’clock in the afternoon, it felt like ten o’clock at night. She needed to sleep, but she knew that taking a nap during the day was not normal — especially for someone who had a lot of homework to do. Her eyelids were heavy and her head was pounding. She decided that she should just go inside and lie down on her bed for a while… maybe until Daisy came home from work; she might be able to help Lisa relax.

	But as soon as Lisa stepped into the house, she realized there was no way she could sleep right away. Her brain would not let her relax until she had checked on Daisy. She quickly changed out of her school clothes and put on a pair of jeans. Next, she brushed her teeth and ran a comb through her hair. Then she grabbed her purse and left the house again.

	She walked barefoot down the sidewalk and then across Main Street to the diner. As she entered the restaurant, everyone looked up from their food… shocked that there was someone else in Mayberry besides themselves.

	But when they saw that it was just Lisa, they put down their forks and waited for her to sit down. She nodded as she walked past each table and ordered a piece of raspberry pie.She sat down at the booth next to Daisy’s usual seat. It was right by the window and she saw that it had been left free for her mother.

	She tried to enjoy her meal with all of those townspeople watching her, but she couldn’t concentrate on anything because she was so worried about the cancer. No one had told her anything else since this morning and it was driving her crazy — especially that weird pink thing they took out of Daisy’s stomach. She kept thinking about how nice it was to feel healthy and energetic… just like Daisy did all the time. It was not fair that people got sick. No one should have to go through pain or discomfort.

	As soon as Lisa was done eating, she left the diner. Her legs felt like they were going to collapse underneath her and her head was clouded with fog. She could not believe that she had run so far without realizing it. When she finally reached Daisy’s house, she stopped to catch her breath before knocking on the door.

	She knocked three times and then heard footsteps coming from inside the house. The door opened slowly and Lisa’s mother stood in the doorway wiping her hands on a dish towel.",0
Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"monster forever, right?”

Gregory nodded and stroked her hair lovingly. “It will all be over soon, Jenna. I promise.”

Jenna closed her eyes tightly and tried to calm down. She took deep, ragged breaths as she tried not to break down in front of him. She was a warrior and she had to keep calm. She opened her eyes and stared at him for a moment before asking, “Is there anything I can do for now? Do they have any clothes that I can wear?”

He nodded but said nothing else as he went into his bedroom and started rooting around in one of the drawers. He came back out with a pair of jeans for Jenna to wear and gave them to her. He then took one of his shirts from his closet and gave it to her as well.

	Jenna changed into the clothes, but they were too baggy on her body and fell off of her when she tried to button them up. “Can you help me with these?” she asked him.

He nodded and took the jeans from her hands before starting to button them up for her. He slid his hands all the way up towards her hipsand smiled at her as he worked on fastening the buttons. “You look very nice in my clothes,” he told her as he finished with the buttons.

	Jenna smiled at him and told him, “Thank you…for everything.”

	Gregory smiled back at her before he went into the kitchen and grabbed a pair of shoes for her to wear. He brought them to her and said, “Put these on when you’re done.”

Jenna slipped on the shoes and felt a wave of relief wash over her when Gregory told her that he wanted to keep her in his house for a while longer so that no one else could find her. She would have been mortified if any of her friends had found out what happened to her, seeing as she had told them all that she was going out with one of her friends, but instead she was kidnapped and ended up a vampire.

	Jenna took a deep breath before asking Gregory, “Could you take me somewhere? I need some information on where to go next.”

	Gregory looked taken aback by what she had said and asked, “What do you mean?”Jenna answered him, “I’m looking for my attacker. Do you know who they were? What clan it was? There’s so many things I don’t know yet. I need to find the answer to those questions before I can move forward with my life.”

	Gregory stared at her and thought about telling her that he already knew who her attacker was, but he decided against it because he couldn’t be certain it would be the same person that she was thinking of. Gregory told her instead, “You should go to the castle as soon as possible; they will help you get on your feet again. They will also help you locate your attacker so that you may have them punished for what they did to you.”

	Jenna nodded and said, “Okay then…I’ll go there as soon as I can. Thank you for the information Gregory. You’ve been very helpful. You don’t know how much this means to me.”

	Gregory smiled at her because he was happy that he could help her out after all she had been through. He also found himself strangely attracted to her; it was something that hehadn’t felt in a very long time. He had lost his wife many years ago and hadn’t dated anyone since. Now here was Jenna, a beautiful young woman with soft brown hair, deep blue eyes, and pale skin. She had the body of a goddess and Gregory couldn’t help but picture her naked in his bed.

	As Gregory watched Jenna walk out of the room his thoughts began to wander as he wondered what it would be like to take her into his arms and kiss her softly. He felt himself becoming aroused and he decided that it would be best if he went downstairs and waited for her in the living room rather than risk doing something inappropriate around her. He began to wonder why he hadn’t noticed how attractive this young woman was before; she was a vision of loveliness.

	Jenna exited Gregory’s house and headed towards the bus stop at the end of the block. Her body ached in several places due to her injuries, but she knew that they would heal quickly enough with a little bit of blood. All that really mattered to her was finding out where her attacker was so she could have them punished for what they had done to her. She reached into her purse and took out themoney Gregory had given her. It was a nice change from being poor after all, but she knew that she would need to figure out how to get more money soon. She decided that she would go shopping tomorrow and buy some food before going home.

	Jenna arrived at the bus stop and waited for the next bus to arrive. The bus ride was short and it took Jenna a total of fifteen minutes before she arrived at the castle from Gregory’s house.

	Jenna paid for her entry fee and headed towards the entrance of the castle. She passed by several people who were chatting amongst themselves as they walked through a door that led to a basement bar. There didn’t appear to be any sign of her attacker, but she would have to look around at the different tables in just a moment to make sure. She stopped suddenly when she spotted Liam sitting at a table close by. He appeared very calm as he sat alone eating a plate of food. Jenna smiled when she saw him, but he did not seem to notice her which worried her slightly. She decided that it was best to walk over and talk to him while she had the chance. She took a seat across from him and looked at him with a questioning look on her face.",0
The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,"while pointing over at Julia’s doorway with trembling hands.
	Thelma was shouting, “It’s coming for you, Julia! It’s coming for you!”

	Julia walked into Thelma Bates’ bedroom and sat down on the edge of her bed. It wasn’t like she could do anything to help her grandmother. If there was a monster in the house then there was probably nothing that Julia could do to stop it.
	But before she had time to think about what Thelma was saying, Julia saw something moving by her doorway. It looked like a shadow that seemed to be moving very quickly toward the hall closet and then disappeared into it. As soon as the shadow disappeared, Julia rushed out of the room and headed upstairs to her own bedroom.

	Julia made it up to her room without running into anything else odd, but she still wasn’t completely convinced that there was a monster living in the house with them. In fact, Julia knew that it could have been something else altogether. Julia thought about the first time that she had seen the dark figure standing by her doorway and how she thought that it might have been a shadow until it started moving toward her. But that was only an assumption; there had been no way for Julia to know for sure what she saw at the time. So there was a possibility that it wasn’t actually a monster at all.

	Julia went to her bed and fell asleep, hoping that she would be able to get some of the images out of her head.

	During the morning hours, Julia woke up several times but was still unable to go back to sleep because of the vivid images that kept running through her mind. But Julia was having more trouble with the visions than just being unable to get back to sleep. She was also starting to see things in other places as well.
	The last thing that Julia remembered seeing before she felt herself being pulled into another dream-like state was Joe Wheeler’s face.
	There wasn’t anything special about seeing Joe; he came over to the house often enough for Julia to know what he looked like. But somehow, even though she couldn’t remember what had happened during her vision, Julia knew that something bad was going to happen to Joe.

	Julia could hear Thelma yelling from downstairs, but the words didn’t make much sense to Julia. All of a suddenshe could feel herself being pulled away from the house and into a dark tunnel. Julia tried to resist, but the further she was pulled into her vision, the less control she had over her movements. She realized that it was no use; she would either have to let herself be pulled into whatever dream-like state she was in or allow herself to wake up.

	In the next instant, Julia found herself back in bed and covered by a thin sheet with no recollection of what had happened in between. The first thing that came to her mind when she opened her eyes was that she must have slept through the alarm and overslept for work. She quickly jumped out of bed and started to go into the bathroom. But Julia stopped when she noticed that there was someone standing there in front of the mirror. She knew it wasn’t Thelma Bates because Julia knew that her grandmother always got up at six o’clock every morning and got ready for the day before coming downstairs to eat breakfast.
	Julia turned around and noticed that it was Karen Jones who was standing there, staring at Julie with an expression on her face that Julie had never seen on Karen’s face before. Almost as soon as she saw Karen in the bathroom, Juliapushed past her and into the shower without another thought about what was going on or why it was happening to her.

	It wasn’t until after she had finished getting dressed and gone out to the kitchen that she realized what had happened. Julia remembered seeing Karen in the bathroom, but she also remembered her not being there anymore. At first, she thought that maybe she had imagined it. Maybe a small part of her mind tried to convince her that it couldn’t have happened because there was no possible explanation for what she saw. But Julia couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something very weird going on.
	The urge to ignore it won out, and Julia made her way down the stairs and into Thelma’s room. Her grandmother was still sleeping soundly in bed so Julia went into her own room and sat down at the dining table to have a quiet cup of coffee. As she took a sip of her drink, Julia heard what sounded like someone walking across the floor above her.

	Julia went down the staircase and into Thelma’s room again, just to be sure that she hadn’t imagined it. As soon as Julia entered the room, she noticed that something was wrong withThelma’s wheelchair. It wasn’t in its usual position, propped against the far wall near Thelma’s bed. Instead, it was sitting in the middle of the room and one of the wheels had been deliberately bent and destroyed.

	Julia didn’t hesitate; she immediately called Karen on her cell phone and asked if she had been to Thelma’s room earlier in the morning. Karen said no, but Julia knew that there was a big chance that she was lying about being somewhere else when the crime was committed. There were other people living in the house as well, so there was no reason for Julia to think that everyone who lived in her grandmother’s home on the hill could have been responsible for what happened in the basement.

	Julia hung up the phone and quickly returned to her room to retrieve her car keys. She wanted to go back home and look through some of her grandfather’s old books because she suspected that there might have been more information about what was happening to her in them than what she got from local doctors.

	As Julia walked down towards the car, she suddenly had a vision of herself walking through the forest and ending up in a dark while pointing over at Julia’s doorway with trembling hands.

Julia finally learns the truth about the visions.,"comic book and read it.

	As Julia was reading the comic book, she started to feel really uneasy so she put it down and went out of her bedroom. She walked down the stairs as quietly as she could and then continued in a straight line towards Thelma’s bedroom because she knew that there was someone in there that might be able to help her cope with her hallucinations. She stopped at the front door and listened, trying to make out what was making all the noise. She tried listening for a moment with one ear before putting both ears back in place so that she could hear properly. Then she heard it: the sound of a chainsaw being turned on and off again, then a brief moment of silence before it started up again. Julia walked slowly towards Thelma’s bedroom door with her hands fidgeting with her hair. She took deep breaths to calm herself down but then she started stuttering again, so she stopped in the middle of the hallway and put both hands across her mouth so that she could try to stop herself from stuttering and crying out.

	As Julia was about three feet away from Thelma’s bedroom door, she paused again for a moment to listen but the chainsaw noises were suddenlystopped. Then she heard the sounds of a woman yelling “HELP ME!” over and over again.

Julia took a deep breath and tried to calm herself down, but as soon as she was close enough, she heard the sound of Thelma’s bedroom door being kicked open and a chain saw being turned on. Julia took another deep breath as she braced herself for what would happen next. She slowly opened the door and saw that no one was in the room except for Thelma. Her head was lying on its side on the floor by the bed and blood had begun to pool around her head. Thelma’s feet were sticking out from underneath the covers at one end of the bed, but there weren’t any feet on the other side of it.

	Julia became frightened and started to back away towards her bedroom door, but then she heard a loud thud coming from Thelma’s body as if someone had kicked it. Julia became even more frightened and ran back into her own bedroom.

	She shut her bedroom door tightly and took a deep breath again, trying to calm herself down as she listened to the sound of Thelma’s body beinghit again and again with a blunt object.

	At that point, Julia was so frightened that she didn’t think that she could take another second of it. She ran back out of her bedroom and down the stairs, out of the house, and into the woods before she felt safe enough to take another deep breath.

	It was dark outside, but Julia could make out the outlines of trees all around her. She didn’t know where to go, so she just started walking deeper and deeper into the woods. She kept going until her legs were too tired for her to walk any further. She sat down on a log nearby and leaned back against it, breathing heavily as she tried to regain control of herself. She closed her eyes and began to think about that night’s events as calmly as she could, but then all of the memories from the night before came back to her in a rush and she started crying uncontrollably.

	Julia continued crying until she calmed down enough so that she was able to take another deep breath and start thinking about what was happening with her. She came to the conclusion that it must be some sort of mental illness, but one that only affected her when she slept. She didn’t knowwhat to do about it, though. At least she had the thought that it only happened while she slept to comfort her. Then she fell asleep again, hoping that whatever was happening to her wouldn’t happen again tonight and hoping that if it did, that it wouldn’t cause her any physical harm.

	The next day, Julia woke up early and went to visit Thelma Bates at the hospital. She was so worried about Thelma that she forgot all about her own visions for a while. When Julia got to the hospital, though, she learned that Thelma had died during the night from a stroke caused by a heart attack.

	Julia was shocked and horrified to learn that Thelma had died so suddenly and unexpectedly. She felt guilty about it for a while, even though she knew that there was nothing that anyone could have done to save her. Julia went home after visiting the hospital and spent the rest of the day in bed, trying to keep her mind off of what had happened.

	Later that night while Julia was sleeping, something happened that made her question whether or not her visions were caused by some sort of mental illness or if they were something else entirely. While Julia slept, Mary walked into Thelma’s room. She grabbed a chainsaw and started running the saw over and over again until its motor quit working all together. Just as she went to turn it on for the sixth time, something caught her eye in the corner of the room. She looked up to see a thin dark shadow that seemed to be standing directly over Thelma’s bed. It stood there for a moment looking over Thelma’s unmoving body and then slowly disappeared into thin air.

	Mary’s vision only ended when she woke up screaming from her own bed a short while later. She got up out of bed, but decided that it would be better if she didn’t tell Julia what she had seen at the hospital that night.

	The next day, Julia decided that she wanted to speak with Karen Jones about what had happened at the hospital the night before. Karen was a teenager who lived in the same apartment complex as Julia and she was always friendly when she saw Julia out on one of her walks around town. She agreed to meet with Julia that evening, but only if it was in a public place; she didn’t want to get involved with any of the visions or hauntings that were taking place in town. comic book and read it.

While Julia slept, Mary walked into Thelma’s room. She grabbed a chainsaw and started running the saw over and over again until its motor quit working all together. Just as she went to turn it on for the sixth time, something caught her eye in the corner of the room. She looked up to see a thin dark shadow that seemed to be standing directly over Thelma’s bed. It stood there for a moment looking over Thelma’s unmoving body and then slowly disappeared into thin air.

	Mary’s vision only ended when she woke up screaming from her own bed a short while later. She got up out of bed, but decided that it would be better if she didn’t tell Julia what she had seen at the hospital that night.

	The next day, Julia decided that she wanted to speak with Karen Jones about what had happened at the hospital the night before. Karen was a teenager who lived in the same apartment complex as Julia and she was always friendly when she saw Julia out on one of her walks around town. She agreed to meet with Julia that evening, but only if it was in a public place; she didn’t want to get involved with any of the visions or hauntings that were taking place in town.",0
Daisy ultimately beats cancer and her story inspires hope in her community.,"?” Lisa was really crying now, and Daisy was comforted by her daughter’s tears.

“That will never happen,” she said. “I have faith in the doctors and my own determination not to give up. I know that God won’t let me down. He must have a plan for me. And besides, I’ll still be here with you, and we could get through this together.”

“I know you’re right,” responded Lisa slowly drying her eyes. “Now if you can just get the rest of the town to believe it, everything will be fine.”

Daisy laughed lightly. She then continued, “My friends and neighbors are doing their best to be supportive. But they all seem to have a hard time believing it too. I just wish they would…”

Lisa interrupted her. “What if they had seen what you’ve seen? Your treatments were so painful and debilitating at times that I would literally have to pull you through the house on your stomach so that you wouldn’t fall down. One of the worst days was when they made you stand up after you’d been lying flat on your back all day. I had to hold onto your arms and pull you to your feet. I thought we were going to have a nervous breakdown right there in the hospital room.”

“I remember,” replied Daisy quietly smiling. “But those days are over now, and the only thing that really worries me is whether I’ll be able to work here at the store when my treatments are over with. They’re so complicated and exacting that I just don’t know. But as long as I can take care of my own…”

Daisy paused for a moment. Then she lifted her head and gazed straight at Lisa. “Thank you for being here for me, baby; I couldn’t have made it without you. And it means so much to me that you believe I’ll come back from this. I don’t know how well you know Evelyn Chambers, but she’s the only other person that I can think of who would have such faith in me. She’s got a lot more of it than you do. You should talk to her sometime. She knows I ’ll come back, too.”

Lisa said nothing.

Her mother had become very quiet again, and she stood up slowly, took a few steps across the room, and sat down on the long couch. She picked up the remote control lying next to her glass of iced tea, clicked it on, and watched the TV screen.

Lisa sat down beside her mother. She reached out and took Daisy’s hand. The younger woman was surprised at how hot it felt in her own. As they watched the TV, she said, “Mom, I’m worried about what will happen if you don’t come back. I will be all alone.”

Daisy looked over at her gently and squeezed Lisa’s hand. “I know, baby—it’s so hard on you to have me so sick like this. But I’ll be home on Saturday. You will see.”

Lisa moved her mouth and made noises, but no sound came out of her throat. She couldn’t say anything, not even the things she had been rehearsing in her mind for days on end, but now that she was here, right next to her, she could not make them come out.

She moved her hand from Daisy’s and put it on her own face, feeling the coldness of the skin through the thin cotton of her T-shirt. Her eyes were red; she could just make them out in the dim light. She moved her hand slowly down to the side of her neck, and then she touched the long scar that ran from her collarbone to below her ear. She did not move it away right away, but just traced over its length gently with her fingers.

She moved her hand away to look at it, and then moved her head slightly one way and then the other so she could see it from the left and then from the right.

“It’s so big, honey—it looks like a snake bite. They said the scar would go away in a few months, but it has been a year now, and it looks the same. I think they must have been wrong and that it will always look like that.” She moved her head back to look at her mother and smiled. “But you know what’s weird? I don’t even notice it anymore. It just blends in with everything  else on my body.”

Her mother smiled at her, and then she took Daisy’s hand again. Her skin felt soft and warm, like a rose petal. Daisy closed her eyes for a second and felt the heat rising through her body.

“You know,” she continued, “I was so scared at first. But here I am a year later—cancer free—and that fear has completely disappeared. There are no more shadows on the horizon now that I have beaten the thing that was trying to kill me. And it wouldn’t be possible without all of you.”

She moved her head around in a circle, and everyone in the Mayberry community who had prayed for her or helped in any way stood up from where they were seated and cheered. She stood as well, and the group circled around her with smiles on their faces. Some of them brought their hands together in prayer, while others moved to give Daisy a hug or shake her hand.

“Thank you all so much,” she said when the parade had finally ended and everyone had returned to their seats. “You really don’t know how much this means to me. I am so amazed by all of the support I have gotten from Mayberry.

The townspeople and the people here in this square have helped me in ways that I never thought were possible, and for that I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. And for those of you who haven’t had the chance yet, there is still time to join Mayberry in their fight against cancer. You can join us on May 12th at 11 AM at Mayberry Square as we host Walk-a-Thon, which is a fundraiser for local cancer patients. We will have t-shirts and balloons available for purchase, so be sure to come down and support Mayberry.

The next few days were filled with visitors coming to see Daisy in the Mayberry Square. People came from miles away just to shake her hand and tell her how much they admired her. She happily talked with everyone, and gave each person words of encouragement as she had been doing for the last few days.

Mayberry Square was not the only place that was filled with visitors who had come to see Daisy; her home was also filled with visitors every day. Among the guests were many of those who had prayed for her during her  battle with cancer and were relieved to see that their prayers had been answered. While some of the visitors were there to pay their respects, others came out of curiosity and just wanted to catch a glimpse of Daisy in person.

Daisy Mayberry was truly a hero, an inspiration to millions of people who watched her story with cancer unfold. Her story had become known worldwide, thanks to the internet and television. While she was not the only one in her community who had been stricken with cancer, she was definitely the most popular of them all.

A few years past after Daisy had beaten cancer and things were going as usual. She was happy to be alive, and very proud of herself for beating the disease. She had many ideas about how to help others with their problems, and decided that it was time to put those ideas into action.

The first thing she did was open up her own web site so that people from across the country and around the world could get in touch with her. She often received letters from cancer patients who were seeking advice about how to survive a cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment.

She then established a non profit organization with the goal of providing aid to those in need. At first, the organization was called “Daisy’s Daisy Foundation”, in memory of her deceased pet dog. Over time, the name was changed to “The Mayberry Community Outreach”.

The non profit organization offered a broad range of services. The help that she offered ranged from financial assistance, to emotional counseling, to spiritual guidance. She also taught classes about how to cope with the stress of having cancer and provided educational materials about how to prevent the disease.

Over time, people from all over the world started looking up to her as an inspiration, especially those who had been diagnosed with cancer. As a result of her story they never lost hope and were determined to overcome their illness.

Even though she was not a medical professional by any stretch of the imagination, she was happy to share her own experiences and provide support in whatever way she could. She knew from personal experience how tough it was to deal with cancer on your own. She knew what it was like to lose all hope and become depressed when the fight against cancer seemed hopeless. And she knew that there were not enough resources in her community to help those who needed it.

She also knew firsthand how hard it was for family members to care for a loved one who is going through a long, debilitating illness. She was determined to do whatever she could to ease the burden for those who were struggling.

The Mayberry community was truly blessed to have Daisy Mayberry as their neighbor and friend.",1
"Natalie Harper makes a deal with Trevor Lockwood, a man she met online, to meet him in person in exchange for money so that she can pay her rent .","Natalie Harper hated living at home. But with the economy tanking and her teaching job being cut, there was no other option for her. She had no idea how she was going to make it through the next two years until she finished her teaching degree.
   Natalie often felt like a failure. She had dropped out of high school at eighteen, moved to New York City, and then come back to the suburbs of Westport to live with her mom and dad. Natalie knew that she had been given a golden opportunity by her parents, but she couldn’t help feeling that it had all been wasted.
   She had always dreamed of becoming a writer, but after spending so much time working two jobs to make ends meet, she had never found the time to write anything other than grocery lists.
   Natalie thought that things were going well in her life. She was twenty-two and still young enough to go after what she wanted. But she knew that something was missing—romance in her life. At least that’s what she told herself every night in bed as she stared at the ceiling.
   And since being out of school for nearly three years, Natalie had found herself not meeting any eligible men.There were times when she thought about dating a man her own age, but it never seemed to work out.
   So after talking to some of her girlfriends about how they could make sure they were always meeting someone new, Natalie had decided that she needed to do something wild and crazy, something that would get her noticed and make her stand out from the rest of the women in Westport. One of her friends suggested speed dating, but Natalie didn’t want to do it because she couldn’t imagine getting set up on a date with someone and then having to leave after only twenty minutes.
   Another friend suggested going to a bar and trying to pick up a drunk guy; the problem with that was that she wouldn’t know what she wanted until morning.
   Her other friend hadn’t seen a single available guy in Westport since graduating from college six years ago, and she was convinced that everyone outside of Westport was either gay or married.
   After spending several days trying to figure out what she should do, Natalie decided that the only way to meet someone new would be on her own.
   And after finding people from all over the world on her favorite site for online dating, Natalie knewexactly what she wanted to do. She had talked to a few people through the site, and they had all said that online dating was where it was at. She searched through dozens of profiles of men who were interested in meeting someone new, and she finally decided that she wanted to meet Trevor Lockwood, a 27-year-old advertising executive who lived in New York City. Trevor had sent her several messages online, and she had found his profile intriguing. She knew that he was looking for a woman who wasn’t afraid of a bit of adventure, and she also knew that he hated it when people lied. And Natalie Harper hated being dishonest even more than she loved the idea of meeting a guy from New York City. After receiving a request from Trevor to speak with him on the phone, Natalie agreed to do so because it was finally a chance for her to be honest with someone who might actually get to know her. They talked about everything from their favorite movies and books to their careers and their expectations about dating. When they ended the phone call, Natalie had felt hopeful for the first time in a long time. She understood that there was no guarantee that Trevor wouldn’t turn out to be ajerk, but she also knew that she had to at least give him a chance. However, she didn’t have enough money to travel to New York City for an in-person interview, so she was willing to agree to almost anything that he might ask for. Her monthly rent was more than twice what the average student earned, and she didn’t know what she would do if she couldn’t bring in some additional income. Trevor agreed to pay her $100 for a twenty-minute phone call, so Natalie spent the next few days planning what she would say during their conversation. She figured that since he probably lived in New York, she should bring up some places that she had visited or where she thought that they should go on a date. She didn’t want to waste their twenty minutes babbling about unimportant things like what kind of cereal he liked or how many siblings he had. Still, she also didn’t want to overwhelm him with information about her life and how awesome it was, so she practiced talking about why she wanted to meet someone new—and why he should meet her. Natalie arrived at the coffee shop on West 11th Street fifteen minutes early. After looking around for a few minutes, she spotted a guywho was fiddling with his phone and tried to remember why she had chosen that particular place. The interior of the building made her feel even more anxious about the upcoming conversation, because it was so different from any other coffee shop that she had ever been in. The walls were painted with bright colors, and the furnishings looked like they had all been custom-made. She didn’t recognize any of the students in the cafe—all of them were young and fashionable, and none of them seemed to be drinking coffee or eating pastries. As a result, Natalie was certain that there wasn’t anyone else in the shop who was there to meet someone like her.
When a door across the room opened, Natalie turned around and gasped when she saw Trevor Lockwood striding toward her with a warm smile on his face. He was carrying his phone in one hand and looked like he had just gotten off work, because he was wearing a white button-down shirt and black pants. He had short brown hair that looked as if it hadn’t been combed in a while, and he was wearing black designer glasses. She held out her hand and tried not to look nervous as he shook it, but she couldn’t stop shivering from",0
"Mary Smith, George Smith, Jessica Doe, and John Doe all give testimony in court and John Doe is ultimately convicted and sent to prison.","and called the police.

Karen Wilkinson, a police officer who also previously worked as a therapist, was called to the stand as an expert witness on the effects post-traumatic stress disorder can have on rape survivors. Through Karen’s testimony, the defense lawyer proved that Mary Smith’s behavior on the night she was mugged mirrored symptoms of PTSD, and that while her actions were still within the realm of possibility for someone who had been through something like this, it was possible that she could be mistaken in her recollection of events.

The defense lawyer questioned Melissa Jones next and asked if she had ever been questioned by the police about what happened at the ATM, and Melissa replied that she had. The defense lawyer then asked why she didn’t tell the police about Roger’s phone call, but Melissa refused to answer because her husband had instructed her not to.

The defense lawyer called George Smith as a witness last, and when he took the stand, it was clear that John Doe did not like him. George Smith testified that he moved to Orlando shortly after his 18th birthday, and in his testimony, he seemed more interested in impressing the jury than telling the truth. All of this helped convince the jury of John Doe’s innocence. They found him not guiltyof both counts, and the judge gave him one year of probation as a result of his first offense.

John Doe was released from prison later that same day, and he immediately came to Mary Smith’s house with flowers and a bottle of wine, which he had stolen from the trial room before leaving. He apologized for putting her through the ordeal and she forgave him, but she also reminded him that she was filing charges for violating his probation. He laughed at her, reminding her that she had already forgiven him for everything, and Mary Smith had no response to that except a shrug.

After he left, her father knocked on the door and came in to find out what was going on. He was furious, but Mary Smith stood by everything she said about being robbed at the ATM and although her father wanted her to file charges against John Doe for violating his probation, she refused to listen to him. She told him that she was no longer in danger and that there was nothing John Doe could do to hurt her now.

The next day, Mary Smith met with Mrs. Brown, the owner of a local art gallery that she had been working with since before the incident; Mrs. Brown told her that she had just lost a valuable piece ofartwork because Mary Smith was too shaken up to go back to work. Mrs. Brown was disappointed in Mary Smith’s decision to let John Doe off with nothing more than a slap on the wrist, but Mary Smith didn’t see what she could do about it short of getting police involved again, which she didn’t want to do. Mrs. Brown told Mary Smith that she understood her position and offered her a full time job at the art gallery after she was completely recovered.

Mary Smith was happy to be back at work and started receiving phone calls from George Smith as soon as the news broke of how well he reacted to John Doe’s escape from prison. He bragged about doing such a good job and acted like he was the hero for taking down an entire courtroom of people who were there because they had been robbed by John Doe. He also told Mary Smith that he believed that John Doe would have raped her if she hadn’t decided to run away, but she didn’t believe him. She thought he was only saying that because he didn’t want her to know that John Doe had called him and implied that the only reason Mary Smith had ever gone out with him at all was so she could get abetter job for herself.

George Smith started telling people that Mary Smith had been his girlfriend until she was robbed, but she told Melissa Jones, who then went to Mrs. Brown and told her what George Smith was saying. Mrs. Brown told George Smith to leave Mary Smith and the art gallery alone or she would get the police involved again, which is what he wanted in the first place; he just wasn’t happy about it.

Jessica Doe heard about everything that went down between Mary Smith and John Doe through George Smith, and when she realized what George was implying, she told him that it wasn’t true at all. She said that John Doe had tried to kiss her when they were together, but she was too afraid of what he might do if she rejected him to tell anyone about it.

Jessica Doe contacted Mary Smith soon after and apologized for not believing her before and told her that if John Doe does anything to Jessica or Melissa, she will break every bone in his body. Mary Smith knew how worried about Jessica and Melissa Jones was, so she never held what she did against her.

John Doe was denied parole after his first hearing and has been in prison ever since. Mary Smith hears from Melissa Jones once every fewmonths and always makes sure that Jessica is alright, even though Mary never talks to her directly. She still visits her mother once every couple of weeks until Mrs. Brown passes away a couple years later, and then she goes to see her aunt Louise Spencer every now and then, but Mary doesn’t notice any change in her demeanor.

John Doe is on his way out of prison after being granted an early release. He’s been out for a little while now and he has been going to Mary Smith’s neighborhood and standing outside of the art gallery a lot more often than usual, which is making everyone in the art world nervous.

Mrs. Brown sends Jessica Doe home early tonight because of how nervous she is about John Doe being out of prison, but when she gets to her apartment Jessica gets a call on the intercom. It’s George Smith coming over to apologize for everything he said and make sure that she’s alright while John Doe is out of prison. She agrees to see him and he makes sure she gets home safely after they finish talking.

George Smith wants to make amends with Mary Smith, too, but he doesn’t know how anymore than he knows how to apologize to Jessica Doe.

When John Doe is released from prison, he goes to the art gallery and sees Mary Smith. He tells her that he’s sorry for what happened and that he’s been trying to get his life together. He asks her for a job, but Mrs. Brown tells him that he’s not welcome there.

A few weeks later, John Doe robs a bank and takes hostages. When the police arrive, they find out that one of the hostages is Mary Smith. They try to negotiate with him, but John Doe doesn’t want to let Mary Smith go. He says that if they don’t give him what he wants then he’ll kill her. The police don’t know what to do, so they call in George Smith.

George Smith tries to talk sense into John Doe, but it doesn’t work. John Doe ends up shooting Mary Smith in the leg and George Smith tackles him to the ground.",0
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.","that she would be able to solve this mystery and save the dogs.

	Two hours later, Kitty was sitting in the middle of the cat’s area of the park. The large black Russian Blue was curled up asleep next to her and all of the other cats were sitting calmly together enjoying their lunch. Kitty was trying to think of a way to get them all talking about the dog-nappings because some of them might be able to help her.

	Suddenly, Lulu Laverne, a small black Chihuahua, stood up on her hind legs and shouted, “I know who has been doing it!”

	All of the cats turned their heads to look at Lulu and Kitty shouted out in surprise, “Who? What do you mean? How do you know?”

	Kitty watched as Lulu gave her head a shake, like she was trying to clear it. When she stopped shaking her head and opened her eyes, they were much clearer than they had been when she was sitting down. Lulu looked at Kitty and said, “I know who it is because I have seen his car parked by the entrance to the park.”Kitty jumped out of her seat and ran over to Lulu with her eyes wide open. She tried to get a good look at the small Chihuahua, but the cat in front of her stood between Kitty and Lulu, blocking her view. As Kitty tried to look around him, he nipped at her leg with his teeth and growled at her.

	She stumbled backwards away from the large black cat until she fell onto the ground with a thump. She looked up at him and said, “Alright! Alright! I will move!”

	He stood over her with his head tilted slightly to one side as if he were listening for something. He put his paw on Kitty’s chest and pushed down until she was lying flat on her back.

	He looked into Kitty’s big green eyes and said, “You are in danger of dying here today.” He walked away and sat back down by the other cats without giving them a chance to respond to Kitty.

	Kitty shook her head at the strange black cat, walked over to the Chihuahua, and sat down next to her.

	Lulu Laverne pointed excitedly at Sergei Snipe lyingon the ground and said, “That’s him! That’s him! He’s been killing all of my friends in the park, I know it! I looked around after each one was killed, and I found that cat right there every time!” Her brown eyes were wide with excitement. “I’m sure he has something to do with it. Please help me. You must arrest him for murder.”

	Kitty rubbed her chin as she tried to decide how to proceed. She tried to imagine what kind of dog would take on a black cat twice its size, especially when it was armed with sharp claws and teeth. Even the strongest dogs would run away from such a fight. Thinking this through, she decided that the dog had to be aggressive and have some kind of protection or weapon. It would also need a reason for killing his enemies.

	Kitty said to Lulu, “I’m sure that you are right about this cat being involved in the killings. But why would he kill just dogs? He might be killing them because they are his enemies, but why would he want to kill an enemy who is much smaller than him? There’s a good chancethat the dog would win.”

	“Well, he can kill them because he has sharp claws and teeth, just like a lion does to its prey. And besides, he can kill as many dogs as he wants – they aren’t going to fight back much. He only has to worry about getting caught.”

	Kitty grinned at her. “Yes, I suppose that is true! But what kind of protection or weapons would a dog use against a cat?” She looked around at all the other cats, and saw Sergei staring at her from across the park.

	Betty Beagle stood up and said, “He uses guns! Dog guns! Cats are afraid of loud noises.”

	Kitty looked at Betty with admiration. She was a smart dog. She knew that most cats were afraid of loud noises, because they had been naturally selected by hunters to fear them, so predators wouldn’t hear their prey when they were hunting for it.

	Kitty shouted out, “So what you are saying is that this black cat must have some kind of gun in order to kill all of the dogs in the park without any of them fighting back?”Betty Beagle nodded and ran over to Sergei who was still staring at Kitty. They began to talk, and Betty pointed her nose up in the air at Kitty.

	“I hope you don’t mind that my dog and I were talking about you, Ms. Pawsky. We just think you are a very interesting cat!”

	Kitty laughed and said, “It is no problem! If it will help solve the mystery, then I am happy to be friends with anyone in the park.”

	Betty said, “Yes! We want you to solve our mystery – it has been terrible having all these people killed right in front of our noses. We don’t even have enough time to sniff their hind quarters before we get shot! It has been very scary!”

	Kitty and Betty both looked over at Sergei who had a long white beard and was staring at Kitty with a smile on his face. He didn’t seem bothered by the fact that Betty had called him ‘a cat’ instead of a dog.

	Kitty said, “Well, I want to help you two solve your mystery. And I am going to need",1

The first thing she did was open up her own web site so that people from across the country and around the world could get in touch with her. She often received letters from cancer patients who were seeking advice about how to survive a cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment.

She then established a non profit organization with the goal of providing aid to those in need. At first, the organization was called “Daisy’s Daisy Foundation”, in memory of her deceased pet dog. Over time, the name was changed to “The Mayberry Community Outreach”.

The non profit organization offered a broad range of services. The help that she offered ranged from financial assistance, to emotional counseling, to spiritual guidance. She also taught classes about how to cope with the stress of having cancer and provided educational materials about how to prevent the disease.

Over time, people from all over the world started looking up to her as an inspiration, especially those who had been diagnosed with cancer. As a result of her story they never lost hope and were determined to overcome their illness.

Even though she was not a medical professional by any stretch of the imagination, she was happy to share her own experiences and provide support in whatever way she could. She knew from personal experience how tough it was to deal with cancer on your own. She knew what it was like to lose all hope and become depressed when the fight against cancer seemed hopeless. And she knew that there were not enough resources in her community to help those who needed it.

She also knew firsthand how hard it was for family members to care for a loved one who is going through a long, debilitating illness. She was determined to do whatever she could to ease the burden for those who were struggling.

The Mayberry community was truly blessed to have Daisy Mayberry as their neighbor and friend.",1
Shannon and Brad Barton's marriage is on the rocks due to Brad's infidelity.,"A few months earlier

Shannon Barton was driving home from her job at the college library. She had spent most of the day working on a special project for her boss, and the last thing she wanted to do was go home to Brad. She should have known that he would be there when she came home, but she had hoped that he would have gone out drinking with his friends.
Brad had been calling Shannon all night, and she had been ignoring his calls until finally giving in and picking up. At this point in her marriage, she dreaded the possibility of Brad calling her. She knew that it was only going to be about sex, which was the only way that Brad could communicate with her.  Over the past few months, he had become more and more aggressive towards her sexually, and every time he touched her for the sake of pleasure, she felt degraded. She was at the end of her marriage and wanted nothing more than to leave him.
She walked into their bedroom suite to find Brad sitting on the edge of the bed looking at himself in the full-length mirror. He had his shirt off and looked well-groomed, including the carefully gelled hair on his head.Shannon knew that Brad was trying to look like he was sexy and desirable. He was hoping that she would want to have sex with him, but Shannon just walked into the bedroom without saying a word and stood silently in the doorway. She didn’t even look at Brad as she walked over to her dresser and started getting undressed.
Brad finally noticed Shannon’s presence and said, “Hey Honey! It’s about time you got home! We have got something special planned for tonight, so get a move-on!”
Shannon just frowned at Brad and grabbed her underwear out of the drawer and put them on without saying a word. She had no idea what Brad was talking about when he said they had something special planned, but she was sure it wasn’t anything good.  Shannon turned to face Brad and said, “Brad Barton you are not going to get anything from me tonight! I am done being your nympho slut!”
Brad just laughed out loud and said, “That is so cute!  You really think that you can stop me from getting what I want? You have no power to say no to me anymore.”Shannon just scoffed and said, “Just because I haven’t tried to stop you before doesn’t mean that I can’t do it now! Not another touch, not another kiss or lick from here on out!” Brad didn’t like the way things were going at all. He could tell that Shannon was done with him for good, so he thought it might be time for a little bit of emotional manipulation. Brad said, “That is funny Honey! I know what you really mean when you talk like that! You are just trying to act like a big man instead of showing how much you really love me.” Shannon just rolled her eyes at Brad and said, “No I am not! Like I told you before, if we are going to have a relationship then you need to start treating me right! It looks like you haven’t been able to do that for a while. So goodbye Brad Barton!” Shannon wasn’t afraid of Brad at all. She knew that there was no way he could ever overpower her in a fight or even win an argument against her. He had made his bed and now he would have to lay init. Shannon turned away from Brad and went back into their bedroom to get dressed without paying any attention to him at all.

After Shannon left the room Brad stood up from the bed and walked over to the full-length mirror on the back of his closet door. He looked into the mirror and saw how good he looked with his shirt off and his gel slicked-back hairstyle. Brad decided that it was time to call off his affair, but he wasn’t going to tell Karen Spooner right away. He didn’t want her to get suspicious about something if she seemed like she wanted to spend time with him less than usual. After making up his mind, Brad left the room and went downstairs to eat lunch with his in-laws before they went back out on the mountain to ski for a while.

Shannon’s mother-in-law, Dan Barton, came down from upstairs as soon as the front door closed behind Brad. Dan asked him if Shannon was coming too, but Brad told her that they were having some problems and that Shannon needed some time alone to calm down. Dan looked at Brad for a minute and asked him what was going on between them. Brad told Dan that he didn’t wantto talk about it at the moment and that it would be better if they just got out of there for a little while.

Dan Barton was shocked by Brad’s response because she had never seen the usually-cheerful Brad act so serious before. Dan decided to let their conversation drop then. She didn’t like it when people talked about their personal lives at family get-togethers anyway. She always saw those events as a time when the family could escape from all of their stress and just have a good time together.

A little while later, Brad finished eating the lunch that his mother-in-law had prepared for him and washed his hands at the sink before putting on his ski gear. He figured that maybe he should wait until they got back from skiing to tell Karen Spooner about their relationship. Brad didn’t want to ruin the rest of his weekend if she decided to get mad at him or break off their affair all together.

On the other hand, Karen Spooner was sitting in her house in her robe and slippers while she wrote a very long letter to her husband. Karen was planning on telling him about the affair when she got back from skiing this afternoon. She figured that it would take a",1
Anna Cooper must find a way to stop the darkness from taking over the school and protect the innocent students.,"teacher asks Lily if she has ever had sexual feelings towards another woman, but Lily refuses to answer any of her questions.

- After school, Laura tells Maryanne that she and the other girls now call Anna “the witch” because of her attitude. The two girls agree that they should do something about this problem themselves since no one else will help them. Maryanne suggests that they ask Anna if she can talk to their parents about it; however, Laura refuses to do so because she knows that it will only make things worse for them.

- That night, Anna asks Daniel if he has heard any more stories about Lily’s classmates threatening Maryanne. He confirms this and adds that they have not been acting like normal children either. Daniel is sure that whatever is going on in the town will affect their children as well, so he is very concerned about keeping them safe.

- After Anna has gone to bed, Daniel sits up in bed and thinks about what has been happening at the school. He remembers how his third-grade teacher walked into her classroom with a black eye and broken arm one day after being attacked by a group of boys. He also remembers how she refused to talk about what happened and left right after school was dismissed. This event had a profound effect on him as a child and is still affecting him now, so he decides that he must do something about the situation at the school so that it will not affect his family.

- The next morning, Anna arrives at the school earlier than usual. She goes into the building and heads straight to the principal’s office. As she approaches his door, she sees that it is closed, but she decides to knock anyway just in case he is awake. She knocks once on the door, but there is no answer. She knocks again, but there is still no answer; she begins to wonder whether or not she woke him up. She decides to put her ear up against the door in hopes of hearing some noise coming from inside; however, there is only silence. Anna turns around and leaves the office because she is not trying to disturb him at this early hour. She goes back outside and heads for the school’s main office. As she walks down the hall, she stops by a classroom door that is open; it belongs to Miss Miller’s class. Anna looks inside and sees that all the lights are off, so she decides to go in and check on her.She takes a quick peek inside the room and notices that everything is quiet and still, so she walks in to investigate. She looks around the room for a moment but does not find anyone there; the room is completely vacant, like no one has been there at all. Anna is confused by this and wonders where everyone could have gone. She decides to stand in the doorway for a moment to see if anyone will come out of class soon. Just as she is thinking this, she hears noises coming from behind her. She turns around and finds that Lily Washington has emerged from the classroom door and is walking toward her. Lily waves at Anna and smiles; Anna returns the gesture but keeps her eyes peeled because she does not trust her. Lily asks Anna what she is doing standing there, but Anna ignores Lily’s question and tells her to return to class. Anna reaches out and grabs Lily’s arm, but instead of pulling on it, she pushes it away from her body. She tells Lily to go home because there is no school today. Lily frowns and begins to argue with Anna about this, so Anna drags her toward the doorway and pushes her out into the hallway. As they are walking down the hall together, Lily asks Anna why she thinks that thereis no school today. Anna explains to her that it is Friday and everyone should be at home doing their work. Anna looks over at the clock in the hallway while she is talking; it says 8:59 a.m., and Miss Miller’s class starts at 8:50 a.m., so class must be over by now. They walk outside and Lily begins to run away from Anna, but Anna runs after her until she stops her from attempting to leave the building. She reminds Lily that it is not safe for her to be outside right now because of all the bad things that have been happening at the school and tells her that she should forget about school and just start to work on her homework.

Lily says nothing in response; instead she whines like a little girl who wants something but does not have the money to buy it. Anna explains that working on homework means doing well in school; however, Lily tells her that people who do well in school are not nice people. Anna’s eyes widen at these words and her mouth opens slightly before closing. She tries to explain to Lily that most of the students at the school are very nice; in fact, she thinks that Lily is a very nice girl herself. But before Anna canget any more words out, Lily runs off and runs around the building trying to catch up with her friends from school. Anna has no choice but to watch her flee from the doors of the building and jump into a waiting car that is ready to drive away.

Anna waits for about ten minutes then walks back inside. She hears a crash come from behind the door just as she is about to enter, so she hurries away from it. It must be from one of the boys, she thinks to herself because Maryanne would not have done such a thing. When she gets back inside, she walks down the hallway and looks for Daniel Cooper, but he says nothing when he sees her so Anna walks back down the hall and heads toward Miss Miller’s classroom. She finds all of the chairs pushed in and the room empty, so she follows her instinct and takes a look inside Maryanne’s second grade classroom. It is empty as well so Anna moves on to Miss Miller’s first grade classroom. She finds that it is also empty, but she notices a pile of books on the floor beneath Miss Miller’s desk. She bends down to pick up one of the books in an attempt to read it, but when she does, she feels a sharp pain in her back and everything goes black.",0
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.","that she would be able to solve this mystery and save the dogs.

	Two hours later, Kitty was sitting in the middle of the cat’s area of the park. The large black Russian Blue was curled up asleep next to her and all of the other cats were sitting calmly together enjoying their lunch. Kitty was trying to think of a way to get them all talking about the dog-nappings because some of them might be able to help her.

	Suddenly, Lulu Laverne, a small black Chihuahua, stood up on her hind legs and shouted, “I know who has been doing it!”

	All of the cats turned their heads to look at Lulu and Kitty shouted out in surprise, “Who? What do you mean? How do you know?”

	Kitty watched as Lulu gave her head a shake, like she was trying to clear it. When she stopped shaking her head and opened her eyes, they were much clearer than they had been when she was sitting down. Lulu looked at Kitty and said, “I know who it is because I have seen his car parked by the entrance to the park.”Kitty jumped out of her seat and ran over to Lulu with her eyes wide open. She tried to get a good look at the small Chihuahua, but the cat in front of her stood between Kitty and Lulu, blocking her view. As Kitty tried to look around him, he nipped at her leg with his teeth and growled at her.

	She stumbled backwards away from the large black cat until she fell onto the ground with a thump. She looked up at him and said, “Alright! Alright! I will move!”

	He stood over her with his head tilted slightly to one side as if he were listening for something. He put his paw on Kitty’s chest and pushed down until she was lying flat on her back.

	He looked into Kitty’s big green eyes and said, “You are in danger of dying here today.” He walked away and sat back down by the other cats without giving them a chance to respond to Kitty.

	Kitty shook her head at the strange black cat, walked over to the Chihuahua, and sat down next to her.

	Lulu Laverne pointed excitedly at Sergei Snipe lyingon the ground and said, “That’s him! That’s him! He’s been killing all of my friends in the park, I know it! I looked around after each one was killed, and I found that cat right there every time!” Her brown eyes were wide with excitement. “I’m sure he has something to do with it. Please help me. You must arrest him for murder.”

	Kitty rubbed her chin as she tried to decide how to proceed. She tried to imagine what kind of dog would take on a black cat twice its size, especially when it was armed with sharp claws and teeth. Even the strongest dogs would run away from such a fight. Thinking this through, she decided that the dog had to be aggressive and have some kind of protection or weapon. It would also need a reason for killing his enemies.

	Kitty said to Lulu, “I’m sure that you are right about this cat being involved in the killings. But why would he kill just dogs? He might be killing them because they are his enemies, but why would he want to kill an enemy who is much smaller than him? There’s a good chancethat the dog would win.”

	“Well, he can kill them because he has sharp claws and teeth, just like a lion does to its prey. And besides, he can kill as many dogs as he wants – they aren’t going to fight back much. He only has to worry about getting caught.”

	Kitty grinned at her. “Yes, I suppose that is true! But what kind of protection or weapons would a dog use against a cat?” She looked around at all the other cats, and saw Sergei staring at her from across the park.

	Betty Beagle stood up and said, “He uses guns! Dog guns! Cats are afraid of loud noises.”

	Kitty looked at Betty with admiration. She was a smart dog. She knew that most cats were afraid of loud noises, because they had been naturally selected by hunters to fear them, so predators wouldn’t hear their prey when they were hunting for it.

	Kitty shouted out, “So what you are saying is that this black cat must have some kind of gun in order to kill all of the dogs in the park without any of them fighting back?”Betty Beagle nodded and ran over to Sergei who was still staring at Kitty. They began to talk, and Betty pointed her nose up in the air at Kitty.

	“I hope you don’t mind that my dog and I were talking about you, Ms. Pawsky. We just think you are a very interesting cat!”

	Kitty laughed and said, “It is no problem! If it will help solve the mystery, then I am happy to be friends with anyone in the park.”

	Betty said, “Yes! We want you to solve our mystery – it has been terrible having all these people killed right in front of our noses. We don’t even have enough time to sniff their hind quarters before we get shot! It has been very scary!”

	Kitty and Betty both looked over at Sergei who had a long white beard and was staring at Kitty with a smile on his face. He didn’t seem bothered by the fact that Betty had called him ‘a cat’ instead of a dog.

	Kitty said, “Well, I want to help you two solve your mystery. And I am going to need",1
"Mary Smith, George Smith, Jessica Doe, and John Doe all give testimony in court and John Doe is ultimately convicted and sent to prison.","and called the police.

Karen Wilkinson, a police officer who also previously worked as a therapist, was called to the stand as an expert witness on the effects post-traumatic stress disorder can have on rape survivors. Through Karen’s testimony, the defense lawyer proved that Mary Smith’s behavior on the night she was mugged mirrored symptoms of PTSD, and that while her actions were still within the realm of possibility for someone who had been through something like this, it was possible that she could be mistaken in her recollection of events.

The defense lawyer questioned Melissa Jones next and asked if she had ever been questioned by the police about what happened at the ATM, and Melissa replied that she had. The defense lawyer then asked why she didn’t tell the police about Roger’s phone call, but Melissa refused to answer because her husband had instructed her not to.

The defense lawyer called George Smith as a witness last, and when he took the stand, it was clear that John Doe did not like him. George Smith testified that he moved to Orlando shortly after his 18th birthday, and in his testimony, he seemed more interested in impressing the jury than telling the truth. All of this helped convince the jury of John Doe’s innocence. They found him not guiltyof both counts, and the judge gave him one year of probation as a result of his first offense.

John Doe was released from prison later that same day, and he immediately came to Mary Smith’s house with flowers and a bottle of wine, which he had stolen from the trial room before leaving. He apologized for putting her through the ordeal and she forgave him, but she also reminded him that she was filing charges for violating his probation. He laughed at her, reminding her that she had already forgiven him for everything, and Mary Smith had no response to that except a shrug.

After he left, her father knocked on the door and came in to find out what was going on. He was furious, but Mary Smith stood by everything she said about being robbed at the ATM and although her father wanted her to file charges against John Doe for violating his probation, she refused to listen to him. She told him that she was no longer in danger and that there was nothing John Doe could do to hurt her now.

The next day, Mary Smith met with Mrs. Brown, the owner of a local art gallery that she had been working with since before the incident; Mrs. Brown told her that she had just lost a valuable piece ofartwork because Mary Smith was too shaken up to go back to work. Mrs. Brown was disappointed in Mary Smith’s decision to let John Doe off with nothing more than a slap on the wrist, but Mary Smith didn’t see what she could do about it short of getting police involved again, which she didn’t want to do. Mrs. Brown told Mary Smith that she understood her position and offered her a full time job at the art gallery after she was completely recovered.

Mary Smith was happy to be back at work and started receiving phone calls from George Smith as soon as the news broke of how well he reacted to John Doe’s escape from prison. He bragged about doing such a good job and acted like he was the hero for taking down an entire courtroom of people who were there because they had been robbed by John Doe. He also told Mary Smith that he believed that John Doe would have raped her if she hadn’t decided to run away, but she didn’t believe him. She thought he was only saying that because he didn’t want her to know that John Doe had called him and implied that the only reason Mary Smith had ever gone out with him at all was so she could get abetter job for herself.

George Smith started telling people that Mary Smith had been his girlfriend until she was robbed, but she told Melissa Jones, who then went to Mrs. Brown and told her what George Smith was saying. Mrs. Brown told George Smith to leave Mary Smith and the art gallery alone or she would get the police involved again, which is what he wanted in the first place; he just wasn’t happy about it.

Jessica Doe heard about everything that went down between Mary Smith and John Doe through George Smith, and when she realized what George was implying, she told him that it wasn’t true at all. She said that John Doe had tried to kiss her when they were together, but she was too afraid of what he might do if she rejected him to tell anyone about it.

Jessica Doe contacted Mary Smith soon after and apologized for not believing her before and told her that if John Doe does anything to Jessica or Melissa, she will break every bone in his body. Mary Smith knew how worried about Jessica and Melissa Jones was, so she never held what she did against her.

John Doe was denied parole after his first hearing and has been in prison ever since. Mary Smith hears from Melissa Jones once every fewmonths and always makes sure that Jessica is alright, even though Mary never talks to her directly. She still visits her mother once every couple of weeks until Mrs. Brown passes away a couple years later, and then she goes to see her aunt Louise Spencer every now and then, but Mary doesn’t notice any change in her demeanor.

John Doe is on his way out of prison after being granted an early release. He’s been out for a little while now and he has been going to Mary Smith’s neighborhood and standing outside of the art gallery a lot more often than usual, which is making everyone in the art world nervous.

Mrs. Brown sends Jessica Doe home early tonight because of how nervous she is about John Doe being out of prison, but when she gets to her apartment Jessica gets a call on the intercom. It’s George Smith coming over to apologize for everything he said and make sure that she’s alright while John Doe is out of prison. She agrees to see him and he makes sure she gets home safely after they finish talking.

George Smith wants to make amends with Mary Smith, too, but he doesn’t know how anymore than he knows how to apologize to Jessica Doe.

When John Doe is released from prison, he goes to the art gallery and sees Mary Smith. He tells her that he’s sorry for what happened and that he’s been trying to get his life together. He asks her for a job, but Mrs. Brown tells him that he’s not welcome there.

A few weeks later, John Doe robs a bank and takes hostages. When the police arrive, they find out that one of the hostages is Mary Smith. They try to negotiate with him, but John Doe doesn’t want to let Mary Smith go. He says that if they don’t give him what he wants then he’ll kill her. The police don’t know what to do, so they call in George Smith.

George Smith tries to talk sense into John Doe, but it doesn’t work. John Doe ends up shooting Mary Smith in the leg and George Smith tackles him to the ground.",0
The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"that she would be more inclined to fight the cancer.

	Today, though, Lisa could feel a headache coming on; she had been working non-stop on the project for Mr. Simpson’s class for over a week and it was finally starting to catch up with her.

	She wanted nothing more than to lie down and take a nap; but she didn’t want to miss out on any of the time she had left with Daisy, so she decided that she would push through it and go to school anyway.

	The headache got worse as the day went on, but she managed to force herself to get through all of her classes in spite of it. When the last bell rang, she couldn’t wait to go home and sleep; but again, she felt guilty about leaving her mom alone.

	Still, there was no way that she could have stayed awake another minute; so she set her books down on her desk in the front of the classroom and went back to her locker to put away her books.

	The hallways were practically deserted; only a few other students were still roaming the halls, and none of them happened to be heading in the direction of Lisa’s locker.She put her books away as quickly as she could and then hurried to her car like a woman possessed. She just wanted to get home to see Daisy; she did not want to be anywhere else right now.

	As soon as Lisa got into the driver’s seat, she felt an overwhelming sense of relief wash over her; but it was shattered by the sight she saw when she got out of her car: a crowd of people surrounding Daisy’s old jalopy, which was parked in front of the Simpson house.

	Lisa approached cautiously, trying to see who was standing around her mother’s car; but by the time she got close enough to identify them, Daisy had already gotten into her own car and driven off. All that was left were a few empty beer cans and a cigarette lying on the ground.

	Lisa couldn’t believe it; she had been so busy with school and work that she forgot it was Friday; it must have been some kind of party that they were having at the diner today.

	She knew that Daisy had been going out alone a lot recently because she didn’t want Maggie to get sick from being exposed to all of the germs at the hospital; but hermother was usually well-rested and alert when she came back, so Lisa thought that she must be in good health.

	Lisa slowly approached the gathering and was surprised to see that almost everyone she knew was there: Mr. Simpson, Evelyn, Joe and Tanya Swanson, Patty and Selma Bouvier, Mary-Lee Johnston, Herb Powell… She suddenly realized that Daisy’s cancer was a town secret and wondered how long it had been before they had invited her to join their group.

	In fact, this secret is shared by almost everyone in Mayberry because Daisy did not want anyone to worry about her or feel sorry for her. In fact, she never wanted anyone to know about it. But lately, she seemed to be less concerned about covering up her condition and was therefore more inclined to spend time outside with her friends.

	Finally, the group dispersed and Lisa found herself alone in front of Daisy’s old jalopy. She looked down at the cigarette butt on the ground and then up at her house. She needed to get inside, so she could go back into her room and check on Daisy.

	Even though it was only four o’clock in the afternoon, it felt like ten o’clock at night. She needed to sleep, but she knew that taking a nap during the day was not normal — especially for someone who had a lot of homework to do. Her eyelids were heavy and her head was pounding. She decided that she should just go inside and lie down on her bed for a while… maybe until Daisy came home from work; she might be able to help Lisa relax.

	But as soon as Lisa stepped into the house, she realized there was no way she could sleep right away. Her brain would not let her relax until she had checked on Daisy. She quickly changed out of her school clothes and put on a pair of jeans. Next, she brushed her teeth and ran a comb through her hair. Then she grabbed her purse and left the house again.

	She walked barefoot down the sidewalk and then across Main Street to the diner. As she entered the restaurant, everyone looked up from their food… shocked that there was someone else in Mayberry besides themselves.

	But when they saw that it was just Lisa, they put down their forks and waited for her to sit down. She nodded as she walked past each table and ordered a piece of raspberry pie.She sat down at the booth next to Daisy’s usual seat. It was right by the window and she saw that it had been left free for her mother.

	She tried to enjoy her meal with all of those townspeople watching her, but she couldn’t concentrate on anything because she was so worried about the cancer. No one had told her anything else since this morning and it was driving her crazy — especially that weird pink thing they took out of Daisy’s stomach. She kept thinking about how nice it was to feel healthy and energetic… just like Daisy did all the time. It was not fair that people got sick. No one should have to go through pain or discomfort.

	As soon as Lisa was done eating, she left the diner. Her legs felt like they were going to collapse underneath her and her head was clouded with fog. She could not believe that she had run so far without realizing it. When she finally reached Daisy’s house, she stopped to catch her breath before knocking on the door.

	She knocked three times and then heard footsteps coming from inside the house. The door opened slowly and Lisa’s mother stood in the doorway wiping her hands on a dish towel.",0

	Kitty looked at Betty with admiration. She was a smart dog. She knew that most cats were afraid of loud noises, because they had been naturally selected by hunters to fear them, so predators wouldn’t hear their prey when they were hunting for it.

	Kitty shouted out, “So what you are saying is that this black cat must have some kind of gun in order to kill all of the dogs in the park without any of them fighting back?”Betty Beagle nodded and ran over to Sergei who was still staring at Kitty. They began to talk, and Betty pointed her nose up in the air at Kitty.

	“I hope you don’t mind that my dog and I were talking about you, Ms. Pawsky. We just think you are a very interesting cat!”

	Kitty laughed and said, “It is no problem! If it will help solve the mystery, then I am happy to be friends with anyone in the park.”

	Betty said, “Yes! We want you to solve our mystery – it has been terrible having all these people killed right in front of our noses. We don’t even have enough time to sniff their hind quarters before we get shot! It has been very scary!”

	Kitty and Betty both looked over at Sergei who had a long white beard and was staring at Kitty with a smile on his face. He didn’t seem bothered by the fact that Betty had called him ‘a cat’ instead of a dog.

	Kitty said, “Well, I want to help you two solve your mystery. And I am going to need",1
Paula meets Sally in college and the two become best friends.,"Paula Taylor and Sally Smith met in college. Paula was an English major from a small town in Vermont, just out of high school, and not at all sure she was cut out for the rigors of a competitive university. Sally was already there, having transferred from a community college near her home in Florida. She had come to college with a ready-made group of friends and more confidence than Paula would ever have. She was smart, funny, outgoing, and worldly beyond her years. Sally knew how to talk to boys; she was the only one of Paula’s girlfriends who could manage that without giggling or blushing. Sally and Paula met at a party—Paula had been invited by a friend from high school and Sally had accompanied another—and they immediately bonded over their shared Midwestern origins and their love of the New Yorker cartoons. They were inseparable after that, and spent most of their college years together, meeting for  dinner once a week and going to the movies and plays together whenever they could afford it. After college, Sally moved to the city, got an art-history job at a downtown museum, and married a man named David Smith. They had one young child, Joel. The marriage ended when David cheated on Sally with a colleague, and they divorced. Meanwhile, Paula stuck around her home town, got a job at the local hospital as an administrator in the maternity ward, and married Jack Taylor, a widower also in his early 30s who had moved into town only about six weeks earlier. Jack worked for a commercial construction company that specialized in schools and universities.

They remained close after college, though their lives took different paths — for one thing, Sally married and had a child, while Paula was single. But when they stayed in touch after graduation, the relationship was filled with meaning.

They became close friends and stayed in touch even after  college. When Sally’s marriage ended, she moved back to Chicago to live with her parents for a while, until she was feeling better. She kept in touch with Paula, and they even met up from time to time and ate dinner at the same restaurant. Once Sally wanted to go out for a couple of drinks. She suggested a dive bar that she liked because she could always count on the same bartender. They had fun that night, and they talked about how much they missed being in college and living in their old dorm.

Sally eventually got remarried but the marriage didn’t work out and she moved back to Chicago, where she lived with her parents and Joel. She started nursing school while working as an assistant for a doctor. At the same time, Paula had separated from Jack, and they were going through a difficult divorce. The couple’s son Josh was in his teenage years, and he was acting out after Sally and Paula split up.

Paula kept in touch with Sally when she was going through her divorce, and they talked on the phone often. They went to happy hours together, just as they had done in college. They even renewed their friendship with a trip to Las Vegas. Even after their children raised their own families and moved away, Paula and Sally kept in touch, until one day Sally’s life was unexpectedly cut short. She was 53 years old. She died suddenly. She died very unexpectedly from a heart attack.

Paula was devastated when she heard about Sally’s death, and  she went to the funeral with her family. She returned to Chicago soon after the service and helped to pack up Sally’s house.

During one of her visits to Sally’s house, Paula had a strange experience with David Smith, who had been Sally’s husband. David was the man Sally had briefly dated. He was also a college friend of Sally’s, but he hadn’t been in regular contact with her over the years.

David had moved to Chicago after he and Sally separated, and he was living alone for the first time in his life. He also didn’t have Sally’s children keeping him busy anymore. After the funeral, David moved back to Sally’s house in the suburbs, where he continued to live alone.

With nothing to do, he spent most of his time in the kitchen of Sally’s empty house. Occasionally he would move a few dishes and cups around the shelves, where they had always been stored before. Then one day, after moving some of the dishes around, David stumbled upon a forgotten piece of paper that Sally had written on years before.

It was written on yellowed stationery with “College Days",0
"Shannon's father dies and her first book fails, leading her to doubt her talent.","Shannon Chambers’ eyes were shut tightly. Her lips were pursed together. She was clutching a pillow with one hand while the other was pressed against her forehead. It felt like there was an ice cube on top of her head. She took in a deep breath and released it slowly, trying to relax herself. The pain was gone but the feeling of loss still remained, as it had since her father passed away two months ago.

Shannon squeezed her eyes shut. Tears started to well up in them. She tried desperately to fight them back but they eventually seeped through. She let out a small sob and held her father’s pillow closer.

She was about to cry even more when her mother, who was lying next to her in the bed, opened her eyes. Shannon froze.

“Shannon? Are you crying?”

Shannon nodded, sniffling quietly. Her mother laid her father’s head right on top of Shannon’s body.

Shannon placed both arms around her father’s head and hugged him tightly. His head was still cold to the touch but she welcomed it, hoping that it would keep her warm for a while.  She pressed her cheek against him, sniffling again as she tried to get herself together.

She looked up at her mother and saw a sad smile on her face. Shannon wiped the tears from her eyes and said, “I miss him so much.”

“I know you do, honey. But he’s not in any pain anymore. He’s not suffering. And you will see him again, hopefully sooner than later. You will now have two guides to help you along the way until the day comes when we are all reunited with our loved ones.”

Shannon moved her arms out from around her father’s head but hugged him again. “What guides?”

Her mother kissed her on the cheek and said, “Your books will be your guides now. They will lead you on a path made of words and stories that will provide both comfort and information until the day we are all reunited.”

Now Shannon looked up at her agent and saw that she too was crying softly. “What happened?” Shannon asked, wiping her own tears away with the sleeve of her sweatshirt. “Why are you all crying?”

Her agent took a couple of deep breaths and said, “I’m sorry, Shannon. I really am. I’m so sorry. But the publisher can’t publish your book as is. And they don’t want to make any  changes or adjustments to it.”

Shannon looked at her with a stunned face and said, “What are you talking about?”

Her agent wiped away more of her tears and explained, “I showed the publisher your first draft. And once they read it, they said it was terrible.”

Shannon’s mouth dropped open in shock. “Terrible? What do you mean? Are you saying that it isn’t any good? That I suck as an author? That I should give up and become a waitress?”

Her agent looked Shannon in the eye and said, “No. Of course not! Don’t be silly, Shannon. This is just a bump in the road. You’re going to be fine. You just need to let this one go and move on to the next project. You’ll do great with that one!”

Shannon closed her eyes. She breathed deeply. She opened her eyes again and said, “Move on? Move on to what? What ever happened to my books needing me? What ever happened to their begging me to write them? What happened  to the stories that were desperate to be told?”

Her agent’s eyes widened. “You haven’t talked to them yet? You really do need some rest. I think it might be best if you went home today and rested for a bit. Now, don’t worry about this one. I’m going to talk to the publisher and they will change their minds. You just take care of yourself right now and we’ll get back on track in no time.”

Shannon forced a smile. “Thanks, Sam. I guess I knew that, but I just needed to hear it from you.”

Her agent smiled back. “Of course! Whenever you need me. Just remember that I’m here for you whenever you call.”

Shannon nodded and said, “I know. Thanks. I really do have to go home now.” Shannon stood up and gave her agent a hug. “I’ll get through this,” she said quietly to herself as she walked out of the office.

Her agent said, “Shannon? Shannon! Where are you going? We need to talk about what publisher to approach for your next book.”

Shannon sighed. “I’ll think about it and let you know when I get home later, okay?”

Her agent smiled again. “Alright, honey. Do whatever you want. I have some work",0
Jennifer comes home from work to find her husband in bed with another woman.,"Jennifer Leighton was a middle-aged woman who worked as a secretary for an advertising agency. She had been married to her husband, Andrew, for fifteen years. He was also a man of the ad industry and was working in the same department. Jennifer had been coming home from work early some days and not telling Andrew where she had been going or what she had been doing. Several times, he had caught her talking to a man on her cell phone but he told himself that it was just friend that wanted to speak with her and soon stopped questioning it.

One Thursday night Jennifer came home to find Andrew in bed with his secretary, Rachel Saunders. He refused to admit to anything and told Jennifer that she was overreacting. He then walked out of the bedroom without waiting for her to pack her things and called his mother in Florida and asked her to come and help with Lily. When she arrived, Andrew said he really wanted Jennifer out of the house by the weekend but his mother had other ideas. She told him that it would take time to get rid of Jennifer and maybe it was better just to let her stay until Christmas when she could go back to her mother’s house or find a place of her own.Jennifer did not know what to do, but she knew she needed to stay strong for Lily. So when her mother-in-law came into the room and told her she hated to see anyone suffer as much as Jennifer did, Jennifer told her that she could leave without a fuss if she wanted. She said that it would be better if Linda left since everyone seemed to agree that Jennifer was a terrible person and what was the point of staying in a house where no one liked her. That night when Andrew came back from work, he apologized for how he had been acting towards Jennifer and told her that it was his mother’s fault and not hers. They went to sleep next to each other like nothing had ever happened, but in the middle of the night, Andrew woke up to find that his mother had taken his clothes out of the closet and taken all of his belongings out of the drawers. He was told by his mother that he should pack up while there was still enough light out so he could see what he needed, but Andrew pushed her out of the way and started throwing things on the floor. That is when Linda put him into a choke hold so she could finish packing up his clothes herself.Andrew was unable to breathe and he told Jennifer that Linda had gone too far and that he needed to call the police. He said that he hoped she would be punished for what she had done, but Jennifer told him that the police would not have believed him if he tried to report his mother for assault because of the reputation they had of being a family of bullies.

Lily was crying and telling her parents that she wanted to go home, but Jennifer told her that they were not going anywhere because Andrew wanted her to stay with them for Christmas. Jennifer did not want Lily to see how awful her father was treating their mother because it would just confuse her more. When Lily’s grandparents came in the next morning with a cake for Lily’s birthday, Andrew refused to let Jennifer’s mother have it unless she apologized to Jennifer. She said that she would only do that if Andrew promised to leave Jennifer alone for the rest of the weekend, but he said that he would not be able to control himself if his wife was present and Jennifer’s mother went back upstairs and closed the door behind her.

     In order for Jennifer to get Andrew back into bed, she had to tell him that she would do whatever he wanted herto do. She knew that he was bluffing because there was no way that Andrew could have possibly gotten his secretary to come over while she was still at work.

Andrew told Jennifer that if she did not follow his orders, he would make sure that their daughter never saw her parents together again. He said that he was counting on Jennifer to be a good mother for Lily even though he knew that she hated him so much and thought of him as a monster. He wanted Jennifer to promise that she would never reveal the truth about what happened between them and how much she hated him in front of their daughter.

Jennifer told Andrew that she would keep all of their secrets, but Andrew said that he knew what Lily had heard from listening to them argue and say hurtful things about one another. He said that their daughter had heard her parents say everything they had ever said to one another and Andrew wanted Jennifer to promise never to use their daughter to hurt him the way that he knew she wanted to.
Jennifer promised Andrew that they would have a better relationship with one another if only he would accept responsibility for what he had done. He said that nothing was wrong between them, but Jennifer said that it was because everything in their life was wrong and that Andrew needed to stopblaming her for everything. Jennifer said that she did not blame him for failing his mother with her Alzheimer disease, but Andrew blamed it all on Jennifer, saying that he had been a better son if only she had done more to help.

Andrew then begged Jennifer not to reveal any of his secrets, and Jennifer said that he had no secrets from her because she knew everything about him. She threatened to turn the radio up loud enough so that Lily would hear everything as it happened. Andrew told Jennifer to do whatever she felt was best for their daughter, but Jennifer said that she would never do anything like that and then asked Andrew to promise her once again that he would never use Lily in order to hurt her.

Andrew promised Jennifer once again not to use Lily in that manner and then added that he knew she had done things of her own accord because of how much money she had spent traveling and buying clothes. He said that there was not enough money to cover the debt on all of the credit cards, and he threatened to take Lily away from Jennifer if she continued with her spending habits. He also told Jennifer that she would never be able to go back to the University because they could no longer afford it. He said that he had been planning on sending her back as",0
Jenna Adams meets Brian Johnson and immediately feels drawn to him.,"Jenna Adams was not a normal person. That much was true. She didn’t think like other people and acted in ways that most people did not understand. However, the main reason why she thought that she was not a normal person was because she would never, ever get married. She had made this decision years ago when she was a teenager and had seen how her parents had been miserable together. She quickly decided that it was not something that she wanted to go through herself, so she would rather be alone forever than spend her life with someone who would make her unhappy. This thought made Jenna smile to herself. She had always been one to embrace solitude and find comfort in her own thoughts. In fact, she sometimes felt as though talking to people was a waste of time because they often did not understand what she was talking about. 	Jenna had lived in this small town her entire life, and the community had become so accustomed to her odd behavior that no one thought much of it. It was common knowledge in the town that she would never have anyone close to her, and this didn’t bother Jenna in the least.

   Jenna was currently sitting in a coffee shop just outside of town. She had ordered a double-double andwas reading a book by one of her favorite authors, Ray Bradbury. Her eyes glanced over the page while her mind wandered to other topics. One of these topics was a man who she had seen just a few minutes earlier. He had entered the restaurant and sat down at a table toward the back. He was about six feet tall with dirty blond hair and brown eyes. His face was attractive but not conventionally so, which is why she found him so fascinating. He was dressed in jeans and a t-shirt – not the most attractive thing, but it did not need to be because he carried himself with an air of confidence about him that commanded the respect of others around him. As she watched him sip his coffee and read a book, Jenna could not take her eyes off of him. She wondered who he was and what his life was like. Since she didn’t know him, it seemed wrong to sit at the table and stare at him without even introducing herself, so she decided to get up from her seat and go speak with him. 	Jenna stood up from her table as discreetly as possible so that the man at the back table would not notice her. She tried to come up with something clever or witty to say when she reached histable, but she was a little too excited to think of anything. As she approached him, it became evident that he had seen her walk in and sit down by herself, but was obviously hoping that he would have time to finish his coffee before someone started a conversation with him. When Jenna reached his table, she sat down across from him and looked into his eyes for the first time. His brown eyes stared back at her as if he were trying to discover who this person was seated across from him. Jenna thought he looked like a deer caught in headlights because of this; he had no idea what to do but also did not want to be rude and cut her short. This was another part of what made him so attractive to her – he held himself with such grace and poise that she knew he was a man worthy of being admired.	“Hi, I’m Jenna,” she said somewhat nervously.

	The man stood up from his chair and extended his hand toward her saying, “Hi, I’m Brian.” They shook hands and Jenna felt a pleasant tingle run up her arm.

	“I never thought I would ever meet you,” she said excitedly.“I am such a huge fan.”

	Brian looked confused for a moment before it dawned on him that she had recognized him. With a smile on his face he asked, “Are you talking about me or the band?”

	It was obvious to Jenna that Brian was accustomed to being recognized and adored by women everywhere. He seemed almost giddy at the idea that someone actually knew who he was, and not for his good looks alone. Jenna felt even more drawn to him because of this; there was an innocence in him that most people lacked as they aged. She knew she would have to tread carefully in the situation since there was already a woman in his life, but she had never felt so strongly about anyone before and she was determined to win him over.

	“I’m talking about you of course silly, but I am also a huge fan of your work with the guys,” she said while blushing. 	Brian smiled again and Jenna couldn’t help but notice that he had perfect white teeth. She liked his smile; it made her feel comfortable around him – almost like he was a close friend. He seemed genuinely interested in getting to know her also.“I’m glad you like my music. I would be more than happy to tell you all about it sometime if you’d like,” he said and Jenna found herself nodding her head in eager agreement without thinking about it first.

	He then moved his hand up to her shoulder and squeezed gently as he continued speaking, “But for now let me introduce myself. My name is Brian Johnson, and I’m very pleased to meet you Jenna.”

	Before he went on, Jenna laughed and said, “Oh wait I know who you are! You’re that amazing guitarist from AC/DC right? If you don’t mind me asking, why are you here?”

	Brian laughed also, and grabbed her hand as he took a step closer. “I actually came here tonight to meet someone that I met through some mutual friends, but now that I have met you I don’t think it matters if they ever show up or not. Would you care to dance?”

	Jenna laughed in response and allowed Brian to guide her out onto the dance floor. As they walked, he squeezed her hand gently which caused her to blush even more",0
"With the help of her new friend, Gary, Shannon comes to understand the harsh realities of life in the inner city and learns that sometimes the truth is much more than just a story.",". Shannon eagerly agreed and Mrs. Saunders gave her Gary’s phone number and address. After thanking her, Shannon wrote down all of the information on a small yellow pad and then sat down to do some more research.
She had not been able to talk to Mike the day before, but she had an appointment with him at eight o’clock that very morning. She got up from her desk, logged off of the computer and locked up her notes in her office. She walked out of the building and headed toward the metro station to catch a train downtown.
Shannon rode the metro downtown with a few of her co-workers, who were going to an office party that evening. Shannon had been invited, but she had already made plans with Gary that night and she did not want to back out at last minute. She was sure everything was going to be fine and she would be able to work things out with Mike and his family.
Shannon walked into the office building where The Doyles’ restaurant was located, and handed her driver’s license to the security guard at the front desk. Luckily, there was no wait inside and Mike greeted Shannon warmly when she walked in.She sat down in a booth with him and sipped her coffee as they discussed her writing assignment. Shannon’s mind raced with questions about Mike and his family. She wanted to know everything about him, but she did not want to be overwhelming since they had only just met.
Mike explained that he had started his own business in Rockville because he wanted to move his family out of the city. He did not like the idea of sending his wife and two boys into some of the worst neighborhoods in Baltimore every day for work. When he opened up his restaurant, business was slow at first, but within six months most of the surrounding restaurants shut down and reopened as Doyles’ franchises. His restaurant was the most popular place to eat in Rockville and it had one of the highest ratings on Zagat’s web site. Mr. Doyle seemed proud of his success and was more than happy to talk about his family to Shannon for hours that morning.
Even though she had already spent three hours with him, a lot of Mike’s story remained a mystery to Shannon. She wanted to learn more about him and his family but he seemed reluctant to talk about them further. He changed the subject and started talking about his wife, Elizabeth,and their two boys. Shannon didn’t want to be rude, so she played along and let Mike ramble on about Liz and the kids. He told her that they were all very close and often went on spontaneous trips together.
Shannon asked Mike how old his boys were and he proudly proclaimed that his oldest son, Edward, was fourteen years old and was an excellent student. She smiled when he mentioned that Edward had a knack for math and planned on attending Johns Hopkins University after high school. Shannon’s heart sank as she looked at Mike in disbelief. She knew that in most neighborhoods it was hard to get into college, let alone graduate from one of the best universities in the country.
Mike continued to talk about his oldest son. He told her that Edward volunteered at a local community center and had recently been accepted into a prestigious summer program at Georgetown University. Shannon wanted to scream at him, “What about your younger son? Surely he isn’t living some sad, lonely existence in the inner city while his older brother gets a chance to come to Georgetown?” But she knew that Mike would never volunteer such information unless she asked him directly.
Mike also went on and on about his youngest son, Gary. Before Shannon couldstop herself, her mouth dropped open when she heard him say that Gary was only ten years old. Ten. All of a sudden she knew why Mike struggled to have a conversation about his family; he was lying to make himself seem better than everyone else in the room.
Shannon excused herself from the table and rushed to the ladies’ room where she locked herself into a stall, pulled out her cell phone and called Gary. She had met Gary earlier that evening during her interview with Mike, but they had only spoken on a casual basis. The phone rang four times before it was picked up.
“Hello?” said a high-pitched voice on the other end of the line.
Shannon was confused by the familiar voice because she had just realized that she had been trying to call Mike this entire time and not Gary. She immediately apologized for the mistake and explained that she was trying to contact Mike, not Gary, but when she thought about it, it made perfect sense because both her interview with Mike and her awkward phone call were as confusing as a bad dream.
Gary must have sensed the tension in Shannon’s voice or perhaps he overheard her talking to herself because he told her that everything was okay. Shannon was relieved thatGary was so calm, but she wondered why he wasn’t more concerned that his father had just been caught lying to her. The phone call lasted only a few seconds before Shannon hung up. She had no idea why she called Gary, but at least she felt a little better after speaking to him. She quickly returned to the table where Gary and his mother were waiting patiently for her to return. No one mentioned the phone call and they all seemed to enjoy their dinner after Mike finished telling them about his favorite vacation spots and how he had recently visited Hawaii.
Mike went on for about twenty minutes before Shannon had had enough of his constant chatter. Mike thought he was smooth and charming, but everyone else found him boring. As soon as she felt uncomfortable, Shannon excused herself again and went back upstairs to the hotel lobby. It would be an understatement to say that she was confused by what had just happened. She didn’t know Mike from anyone else, and she wasn’t interested in getting to know him any better because his answers were so unrealistic. She knew he never left Rockville for vacations or anywhere else for that matter, so how could he possibly be an expert on Hawaii? She needed some sleep before she had to go back downstairs and try to act like everything was okay.",0
"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.","“Hello? Liam?” She said as she waved at him.
	He looked over at Jenna with an annoyed expression on his face. “What do you want?” He asked sarcastically.
	The sarcasm irritated her slightly, but she didn’t show it. “I just wanted to say thank you for saving me when I was being attacked a few weeks ago. I couldn’t have done it without your help.”
	Liam looked taken aback by the compliment and paused for a few seconds before answering. “Don’t mention it, I don’t know what came over me when I saw that you were in trouble, but I just had to help you. It might have been a bad decision on my part since now I am being hunted by some guy because of it.”
	Jenna frowned when she heard this and looked down in shame. “I am sorry Liam, I didn’t think that it would come to this. I will do anything that I can to help you get rid of your attacker... please don’t kill me!”
	Liam laughed a little at the request that Jenna made and said,“I don’t think that I would ever want to kill you Jenna. You are much too pretty, but if your attacker gets past me I can’t guarantee that my next move is going to be as kind.”
	Jenna smiled brightly at him and said, “I will do whatever it takes to stay out of trouble. I don’t want anyone else getting hurt because of my actions.”
	Liam looked at her and smiled back, “I know you will Jenna. You are a good girl and your attacker is lucky to have you as an enemy.”
	Jenna blushed when she heard this compliment and then grew concerned again when she saw that two men were approaching Liam. “You should go now Liam, this is not your problem, I will be fine!”
	Liam shook his head, “I don’t think so Jenna. Besides these guys look harmless enough, but I will let you see them from a safe distance before you make up your mind about them.”
	The two men stopped when they saw Liam standing in front of the two of them and said in unison, “Good evening Mr. Cross;are you enjoying your night?”
	Liam laughed at their corny line and replied, “Yeah I am having a great time. How about you guys, did you come here to have fun tonight?”
	The two men smiled at each other and replied simultaneously, “No, we came to protect you Mr. Cross!”
	Jenna frowned at this response and said in disgust, “You mean you came here to keep me safe from danger?”
	The two men nodded their heads at her with a smile and continued to follow Liam closely as he walked away.
	Jenna followed them closely until they went through a black curtain into what appeared to be another room inside of the castle. When she saw that Liam was still unharmed she breathed a sigh of relief and continued to walk towards the entrance where there wasn’t any sign of her attacker. This made Jenna wonder if they had just been sent by Gregory to be there as a precautionary measure or if they were there because someone was threatening him. Either way Jenna didn’t want to cause any trouble for Gregory, so she quickly walked past his table to head towards the dance floor where there were many people having fun anddancing.
	Music played loudly and the crowd danced wildly to every beat. Jenna took off her coat and put it on the nearest chair so that she could dance freely while still being able to keep an eye on her surroundings at all times. After seeing that none of the people around her were a threat she began to have some fun herself and started dancing with some of the men who asked, but none of them could match up to Liam’s dancing style. He was her hero and savior after all so he deserved a special treat in honor of his name day.
	For the next hour Jenna enjoyed herself by dancing and mingling with some of the other guests while keeping an eye on Liam who remained stationary at his seat with a smile on his face watching her. She saw that he winked at her once in a while and continued to drink from his glass every time it got low without getting up. She knew that he was waiting for her to make some kind of move on him even though she was supposed to be the shy and helpless girl because that’s what he wanted to feel powerful.
	When one of the girls who had asked her for a dance had gotten drunk, Jenna decided that it was time to leave before she ended up being accusedof something that she would never do. She started to make her way through the crowd but Liam stood up before she could reach him and walked toward her.
	“What are you doing here?” Jenna asked while pulling away from the man who had been dancing with her.
	“I thought I told you that I would come and visit you. It wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t at least say happy name day, right?”
	“Happy name day? Is it your birthday or something? I can’t believe I wasted all this time on you when I should have been at home by now,” she said while turning towards the entrance of the club.
	Liam grabbed her arm and held on to it tightly before walking with her through the crowd and out of the club. He stopped only to open the door for her and then they were outside in the parking lot, standing in front of his car.
	“What are you doing? You just told me that it was your name day not even five minutes ago!”
	He ignored her and stood in front of her blocking all of her attempts to move past him. “I am not leaving until you come with me,” he said in a serious voice.",0

They went to sleep next to each other like nothing had ever happened, but in the middle of the night, Andrew woke up to find that his mother had taken his clothes out of the closet and taken all of his belongings out of the drawers. He was told by his mother that he should pack up while there was still enough light out so he could see what he needed, but Andrew pushed her out of the way and started throwing things on the floor. That is when Linda put him into a choke hold so she could finish packing up his clothes herself.Andrew was unable to breathe and he told Jennifer that Linda had gone too far and that he needed to call the police. He said that he hoped she would be punished for what she had done, but Jennifer told him that the police would not have believed him if he tried to report his mother for assault because of the reputation they had of being a family of bullies.

Lily was crying and telling her parents that she wanted to go home, but Jennifer told her that they were not going anywhere because Andrew wanted her to stay with them for Christmas. Jennifer did not want Lily to see how awful her father was treating their mother because it would just confuse her more. When Lily’s grandparents came in the next morning with a cake for Lily’s birthday, Andrew refused to let Jennifer’s mother have it unless she apologized to Jennifer. She said that she would only do that if Andrew promised to leave Jennifer alone for the rest of the weekend, but he said that he would not be able to control himself if his wife was present and Jennifer’s mother went back upstairs and closed the door behind her.

     In order for Jennifer to get Andrew back into bed, she had to tell him that she would do whatever he wanted herto do. She knew that he was bluffing because there was no way that Andrew could have possibly gotten his secretary to come over while she was still at work.

Andrew told Jennifer that if she did not follow his orders, he would make sure that their daughter never saw her parents together again. He said that he was counting on Jennifer to be a good mother for Lily even though he knew that she hated him so much and thought of him as a monster. He wanted Jennifer to promise that she would never reveal the truth about what happened between them and how much she hated him in front of their daughter.

Jennifer told Andrew that she would keep all of their secrets, but Andrew said that he knew what Lily had heard from listening to them argue and say hurtful things about one another. He said that their daughter had heard her parents say everything they had ever said to one another and Andrew wanted Jennifer to promise never to use their daughter to hurt him the way that he knew she wanted to.
Jennifer promised Andrew that they would have a better relationship with one another if only he would accept responsibility for what he had done. He said that nothing was wrong between them, but Jennifer said that it was because everything in their life was wrong and that Andrew needed to stopblaming her for everything. Jennifer said that she did not blame him for failing his mother with her Alzheimer disease, but Andrew blamed it all on Jennifer, saying that he had been a better son if only she had done more to help.

Andrew then begged Jennifer not to reveal any of his secrets, and Jennifer said that he had no secrets from her because she knew everything about him. She threatened to turn the radio up loud enough so that Lily would hear everything as it happened. Andrew told Jennifer to do whatever she felt was best for their daughter, but Jennifer said that she would never do anything like that and then asked Andrew to promise her once again that he would never use Lily in order to hurt her.

Andrew promised Jennifer once again not to use Lily in that manner and then added that he knew she had done things of her own accord because of how much money she had spent traveling and buying clothes. He said that there was not enough money to cover the debt on all of the credit cards, and he threatened to take Lily away from Jennifer if she continued with her spending habits. He also told Jennifer that she would never be able to go back to the University because they could no longer afford it. He said that he had been planning on sending her back as",0
A group of survivors find themselves in a strange new world where they must band together to survive the perils that await them.,"most others. It would be the blood moon tonight, and that meant things would be different from now on. It meant that he would have the power to fulfill his life’s purpose and take over the world. He looked at his watch again and got up; it was time to go home.

	The man walked back into the woods, and after a few minutes of walking, he reached his cabin. He had built it himself when the world had been different; before everything went wrong. At first, he lived in a cave in the forest until he decided to build something better, stronger and permanent. It had been a big undertaking to build it all by himself, but he was proud of what he’d done. With one final kick of his foot against the dirt floor, he sat down and looked at where the deer had died.

	Suddenly, there was a bright light shining through the cabin’s window; instantly, everything became dark and quiet. The man looked around with his eyes wide open; he could hear people moving around in his cabin. His heart began to pound as he got up and tried to quietly walk over to the door in hopes of finding out who these intruders were. He reached the door and turned the handlequietly, trying not to make a sound that might alert them to his presence. The door opened easily, and when he looked inside, all he saw was a long hallway covered with darkness on either side.

	He took a few steps forward and nearly fell over when he felt someone grab hold of his arm tightly. He looked behind him, but he was alone. He looked ahead and saw a stairway that led up to a hallway; as he went up the stairs, more light seemed to come from inside of the cabin. He reached the top of the stairs, turned left and slowly walked down the hallway; he felt as though there were people all around him, watching him intently.

	He stopped for a moment because he could hear whispering coming from behind the door on his left. He looked through the small window in front of him at what was behind it, but it was too dark to see anything. He slowly walked closer to it and then quickly opened it quickly when he heard one of the strangers say, “He’s here!”

	He did not know what came over him, but he felt like he had to protect himself from them; maybe it was their size or their loud voices that disturbed him. He kicked oneof them in the head and then quickly ran away towards the stairway. As he turned around and looked down, he saw someone else come up behind him with a knife; he quickly threw something at the man’s face and then ran away down the stairs with the rest of the man’s friends chasing after him.

	As they all reached the bottom of the stairs, one of them shouted, “Hey you! Stop right there!” It was a woman, and she had a gun pointed at him. He turned around for just a second to see how many people were with her; there were three others behind her. The woman yelled again at him in a loud voice, “Stop right there, and drop your weapon!” The man stood there watching them carefully while holding onto the knife tightly. After he saw that they were all prepared for him, he decided to run away again.

	The man ran away as fast as he could down the hallway, but the woman with the gun was able to stay close behind him. “Don’t move!” she told him in a loud voice again, but he kept running away anyway. She began to chase after him, firing her gun at his sidewhenever she got close enough.

	After running for a few minutes, the man turned around and saw that he was starting to get further away from the people chasing after him. He knew they would never give up looking for him, so he needed to hide someplace until they gave up. He looked around nervously and tried to think where he could go. There was an office door down the hallway that had some papers stacked up against it; there was no one there, so he figured it might be a good place to hide. He walked over there slowly and tried to peek inside; the light was on in the room and he could see that there were some papers on the desk and in boxes on the floor. He slowly opened the door all the way so they couldn’t see him coming inside, and then crawled into the room quietly while holding onto his knife with both hands. The people outside were still yelling for him to stop, but he ignored them as much as he could. As he crawled into the room and began laying on his stomach, he could hear someone outside say that they should keep looking for him and not give up so easily; the man smiled and thought to himself that this might be the day that he finally got away from all of them.The only problem was that when the man raised himself up on his knees, he saw something on the floor in front of him that caught his eye; it was a pair of large metal claws attached to some kind of stick, and when he looked closer at them, he saw that they were attached to a large pair of steel-toed boots. From where he came into the room, the man had been crawling over what looked like a pile of dirty clothes, but now that he was on his knees he could see that they weren’t really clothes at all; they were pieces of dried meat dangling from the ceiling on some kind of weird meat hooks. The man was too shocked to move or yell out; he didn’t know what was going on, but it was obvious that he wasn’t where he wanted to be.

The man carefully stood up and backed away from the boots as far as he could, and as he did so, they began to move towards him. The man tried to move faster backwards but his foot got caught on a piece of clothing and he tripped, falling backwards onto the ground. Before the man could get up to run away again, he felt a burning pain in his calf and looked down;",0
"Shannon's father dies and her first book fails, leading her to doubt her talent.","Shannon Chambers’ eyes were shut tightly. Her lips were pursed together. She was clutching a pillow with one hand while the other was pressed against her forehead. It felt like there was an ice cube on top of her head. She took in a deep breath and released it slowly, trying to relax herself. The pain was gone but the feeling of loss still remained, as it had since her father passed away two months ago.

Shannon squeezed her eyes shut. Tears started to well up in them. She tried desperately to fight them back but they eventually seeped through. She let out a small sob and held her father’s pillow closer.

She was about to cry even more when her mother, who was lying next to her in the bed, opened her eyes. Shannon froze.

“Shannon? Are you crying?”

Shannon nodded, sniffling quietly. Her mother laid her father’s head right on top of Shannon’s body.

Shannon placed both arms around her father’s head and hugged him tightly. His head was still cold to the touch but she welcomed it, hoping that it would keep her warm for a while.  She pressed her cheek against him, sniffling again as she tried to get herself together.

She looked up at her mother and saw a sad smile on her face. Shannon wiped the tears from her eyes and said, “I miss him so much.”

“I know you do, honey. But he’s not in any pain anymore. He’s not suffering. And you will see him again, hopefully sooner than later. You will now have two guides to help you along the way until the day comes when we are all reunited with our loved ones.”

Shannon moved her arms out from around her father’s head but hugged him again. “What guides?”

Her mother kissed her on the cheek and said, “Your books will be your guides now. They will lead you on a path made of words and stories that will provide both comfort and information until the day we are all reunited.”

Now Shannon looked up at her agent and saw that she too was crying softly. “What happened?” Shannon asked, wiping her own tears away with the sleeve of her sweatshirt. “Why are you all crying?”

Her agent took a couple of deep breaths and said, “I’m sorry, Shannon. I really am. I’m so sorry. But the publisher can’t publish your book as is. And they don’t want to make any  changes or adjustments to it.”

Shannon looked at her with a stunned face and said, “What are you talking about?”

Her agent wiped away more of her tears and explained, “I showed the publisher your first draft. And once they read it, they said it was terrible.”

Shannon’s mouth dropped open in shock. “Terrible? What do you mean? Are you saying that it isn’t any good? That I suck as an author? That I should give up and become a waitress?”

Her agent looked Shannon in the eye and said, “No. Of course not! Don’t be silly, Shannon. This is just a bump in the road. You’re going to be fine. You just need to let this one go and move on to the next project. You’ll do great with that one!”

Shannon closed her eyes. She breathed deeply. She opened her eyes again and said, “Move on? Move on to what? What ever happened to my books needing me? What ever happened to their begging me to write them? What happened  to the stories that were desperate to be told?”

Her agent’s eyes widened. “You haven’t talked to them yet? You really do need some rest. I think it might be best if you went home today and rested for a bit. Now, don’t worry about this one. I’m going to talk to the publisher and they will change their minds. You just take care of yourself right now and we’ll get back on track in no time.”

Shannon forced a smile. “Thanks, Sam. I guess I knew that, but I just needed to hear it from you.”

Her agent smiled back. “Of course! Whenever you need me. Just remember that I’m here for you whenever you call.”

Shannon nodded and said, “I know. Thanks. I really do have to go home now.” Shannon stood up and gave her agent a hug. “I’ll get through this,” she said quietly to herself as she walked out of the office.

Her agent said, “Shannon? Shannon! Where are you going? We need to talk about what publisher to approach for your next book.”

Shannon sighed. “I’ll think about it and let you know when I get home later, okay?”

Her agent smiled again. “Alright, honey. Do whatever you want. I have some work",0
"Shannon commits suicide, leaving her husband and young son behind.","few days for Brad to realize that she was gone, so he would probably be distraught and miserable by the time he got home. She thought that it was only fair. Brad had ruined her life for the past three years, and now it was her turn to ruin his.

In addition, Karen figured that Dan Barton and Brad’s father Jeremy Barton wouldn’t mind it if their son were to suffer a bit considering everything he had done to them. After all, they were still upset with Brad about the accident that had killed their daughter Shannon and injured their grandson Jeremy. They would probably be even more unhappy with him if they knew about his affair.

Meanwhile, Dan was walking through the airport parking lot and trying to find Brad’s car. As she was browsing through the rows of cars, she heard another voice say her name. She turned around and saw a man who appeared to be in his mid-twenties standing in front of her. Dan had never met the man before, so she was surprised to see him here at the airport with her.

The man walked up to Dan and held out his hand for her to shake. “I’m sorry for your loss,” he said to her. “My name is Jeremy Barton. I’m Sarah’s husband.” The moment Karen saw the man, she realized that Sarah was Brad’s mistress. She had been trying to keep the fact that Shannon had killed herself a secret from everyone, so she didn’t know how Sarah was involved. To change the subject, Karen asked Jeremy what he was doing at the airport so early in the morning. He explained that he had flown to Chicago yesterday because he hadn’t wanted to wait until today to come home. He had been sitting at home for too long, wondering why Brad hadn’t called him with any news regarding his wife Shannon and son Jeremy. He said that when he finally decided to come home, Sarah had convinced him that it was better if he didn’t make the drive alone. Karen agreed with him that driving long distances by yourself could be boring, so she started walking with him towards the parking lot exit. After they left the airport, Jeremy asked Karen about the accident and if she had read any newspaper articles about it yet. Karen told him that she preferred to stay out of the media spotlight because she didn’t like talking about her husband’s affair. Jeremy apologized for asking her personal questions, but he was just trying to be a good friend. They talked about some other things until they got outside the airport, then Jeremy suddenly remembered that he had promised to give Karen a ride home. He assured her that it wasn’t a problem and offered to drive them both home since she was wearing so many layers of clothes. After driving for a while, they realized that they were quite hungry, so they stopped at a fast food restaurant for breakfast. Jeremy and Karen talked about their families as they ate their food. When their conversation took an awkward turn, Karen asked Jeremy to take a detour on the way home so she could get rid of the rest of her breakfast in a McDonald’s bathroom. When they were finished, Jeremy drove them both back to Sarah’s house.

	When he stepped into the house, Jeremy noticed Sarah and Brad sitting on the couch. It looked like they were having an argument about some personal issues. Brad was pacing around the room and gesturing while Sarah just sat there quietly listening to him. It seemed like Brad was angry with something Sarah had said, so Jeremy decided not to approach them until they were finished talking. He sat down on the couchand began reading a newspaper that was lying on the table in front of him. It took Brad and Sarah about ten minutes to calm down and finally start talking again. Jeremy could tell that both of them were still very upset, so he let them be. He had a feeling that it would be best to let them talk about things in private for as long as it took for them to calm down.

	After an hour or so, Brad and Sarah started talking about Shannon’s death again. Jeremy was surprised at how easily he could start crying again just by thinking about it. He had never cried over a death before, but he couldn’t get past the fact that his own mother had been driving when Shannon walked out into the road. He didn’t want to tell that to Karen and Sarah, though, so he just sat there quietly and listened to them talk about it. It was starting to become clear that this wasn’t the first time that Brad had cheated on Shannon with Sarah. She admitted that she’d been having an affair with him for almost six months now, but she had no idea why Brad would kill himself over her. She said that she didn’t have any feelings for him anymore and even though they’d had sex more than once since Shannon died, their relationship was purely physical. She hadn’t told Brad that she no longer loved him, either.

	When Brad and Sarah were finally done talking about the time leading up to Shannon’s death, Jeremy knew it was probably time to go home. He also knew that he didn’t want to hear about what happened after she killed herself ever again. It was too disturbing for him to hear about how her body had been mangled and then set on fire by the firefighters when they found her by the road.

	Brad and Sarah asked if he wanted to stay at their house for a few days, but he told them that he had to get back to Colorado so he could get some sleep, and because he felt guilty about lying to his mother about staying with them in the first place.

	After saying goodbye to Karen and Sarah, Jeremy got into his car and drove back to Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport.

	His mother was waiting for him at the airport in her own car. She had been there since she dropped Jeremy off at ‘The Field’ that morning, so she was glad to finally see her son again. When Jeremy",0
Sally unexpectedly dies and Paula must deal with the guilt of her secret and the possibility of what could have been.,"Paula told Jack no again and again until she had to tell him to stop calling. She was angry with Jack for what he had done and she wanted nothing to do with him or the kids. She did not want to be involved in their lives ever again. At that point, Jack called Sally’s parents and told them that she was sick and in the hospital. She needed them more than ever, he said. He told them to go see their daughter and check up on her, even though they had only seen her in months or years.

	So the parents went to see Sally in the hospital and she made Jack promise that he would never mention Paula’s name while they were there. She asked him not to make any mention of what had happened between them or that she was involved in some kind of scandal or something. She said she would handle it herself when they left and she was ready to come home again because she didn’t want anyone else knowing about what was happening behind closed doors. So Sally’s parents went home and Jack went back to his life.

	Paula continued living her own life, doing all the things which Sally used to do as well. She went out shopping with Sally’smother, who talked about getting another dog, just like Sally had wanted. She watched the kids, even though it was hard for her to keep them from being around Jack. She drove the little ones to preschool and she cooked dinner for her husband after work, just like Sally used to do.

	And one night she felt a sharp stabbing pain in her head and then she saw blood on the dark floor of her bedroom. It was leaking from between her legs and it was dripping onto the carpet like water from an open faucet. She sat up in bed and screamed for help but the pain was so bad that she fainted before anyone could hear her cries for help.

	When she woke up again, she saw Sally sitting on the edge of her bed. She had never seen Sally look so sick, but then again she never really looked sick to begin with. Her skin was yellow and her eyes looked sunken in and Paula wondered if it was just because of how pale Sally had always been or if maybe there was another reason for it. Her hair was long and blond, falling over her shoulders in soft waves down to her waist. Sally kept looking down at the floor, not meeting Paula’s eyes, and she held a thin piece of paperin her hands. The sight made Paula’s stomach hurt but she couldn’t stop staring at Sally. She knew that this was the moment where things would change forever. She found it funny that the moment was so peaceful and quiet; Sally, sitting on her bed, holding a piece of white paper in her hands.

	Sally was speaking but Paula couldn’t understand what she was saying because of all the blood that seemed to be rushing past her ears. She thought that maybe it was just too quiet in her room so she turned up the volume on the stereo but then there was still no sound coming from Sally’s mouth. She reached out her hand to touch Sally and pull her towards her but when she touched Sally’s face it was icy cold and hard.

	Paula fell back onto the bed in shock but then the next second she jumped up as fast as she could and stared at Sally, who was standing over her. She opened her mouth to speak but all that came out of her mouth was blood. It dripped from her lips and onto the white paper which Sally clutched in one hand as it turned a dark red color like fresh blood. She began to scream again but no sound came out of hermouth.

	She began to feel faint and she couldn’t pull her eyes away from Sally’s face, which appeared to be frozen in time. She was wearing a bright red lipstick, with lines of black mascara and foundation drawn over top of it. Her eyes were outlined in black eye-liner and her hair was full of hairspray with strands sticking up everywhere.

	One strand in particular hung down over the bridge of Sally’s nose and it became increasingly clear to Paula that Sally was dead.

	The door flew open and Paula saw Jack and Lily standing there. They ran over to Sally’s bedside, but before they were able to touch her, she disappeared from the bed and they were left standing alone in the room.

	Jack looked behind him at Paula on the bed and said, “Paula? What happened?”

	Paula didn’t respond because she couldn’t think of what to say. She looked down at the white sheets that were now soaked with Sally’s blood. She didn’t want to look too closely at her friend who lay dead on the white sheets because she knew that it was going to remind her of what she had done.

Paula wondered if Jack knew what happened, but she didn’t ask him because she didn’t want to talk about it. She looked up at her son and he was crying in the corner, holding a bottle of nail polish.

She reached out and took his hand.

	“Mama? What happened?” Josh asked as he looked up into Paula’s face with wide-eyes.

	Paula tried to form words, but couldn’t get the words out because it was all too much to process. Lily brought a small pillow and placed it over her mother’s face. Lily was crying and Josh looked helplessly at them both, but he wasn’t able to do anything about it.

	Paula heard a knock on the door and expected it to be one of their older kids coming home from school or something, but when she pulled back the covers, she saw Sally standing there with David.

	Sally walked over to Jack and put her arm around him and then looked at Paula as if something were about to happen. The next thing Paula knew, the pillow that Lily was holding smashed into her face and then everything became darkness again.",0
Julia Martin starts to experience terrifying visions.,"Julia Martin has always been curious.

	She is an artist, painting in a style that is both abstract and realistic. Some of her paintings are ethereal, with bright colors in strange shapes that don’t seem to make sense. Other of her paintings are realistic, depicting actual scenes and objects. Julia paints the people she sees on the streets during her walks home from school one block away from her house, or the plants she sees hanging from trees along the way. But Julia always paints herself into her paintings; she rarely depicts herself as a child, but more often as an adult woman.
	And to add to her curiosity, Julia has never known a day of her life without suffering from seizures. At first they were simple, and took place so often that she stopped paying attention to them altogether. But then her seizures started becoming more frequent and more intense, until just a couple of months ago she began experiencing them every single day.

	Julia’s seizures also affect her creativity; often, after experiencing a seizure, Julia will not be able to paint for at least a week. She has even been in and out of hospital care because of the severity of her seizures. Her doctors have told her that there is very little hope infinding any sort of cure for her condition, and that they can only offer her pain management when she is having a seizure.
	But the worst part about Julia’s condition is not the pain or the disability. The worst part of all is that it’s making Julia go crazy.

	Julia has been suffering from seizures since she was just a child, but everything changed when she went to college.

	She had always been a social person, but something about the students at her college just didn’t connect with her. She tried to make friends, but every time she did things seemed to go terribly wrong. She suffered from constant ridicule by other students, who sometimes used their words to bully her, and sometimes used physical force. Once they even made a video of themselves throwing food at her while she was having a seizure.

	The night that the video was made Julia had just gotten home from college feeling awful about herself. She hadn’t been able to paint since her last seizure, and she had no idea what was going on with her artwork. It felt like all of the beauty from her paintings had disappeared, and they had become dull and lifeless.

	She began to think that this was why she was havingseizures. That the seizure itself was affecting her artwork, and making it less beautiful.

	Julia knew that something terrible was happening to her, but she didn’t know how to stop it or what to do about it.

	Suddenly, Julia started having a severe seizure. Her entire body began to shake, and she fell face first onto her bed. The whole world went black for a few minutes as her body continued shaking and convulsing uncontrollably. Julia was afraid that something terrible would happen to her at this moment. Who knows what damage could be done to an epileptic person while they were convulsing on their bed?

	When Julia came to, she opened her eyes and looked around the room. The world was still black, but she could see shapes moving in front of her. She thought it sounded like someone was trying to talk to her, but she couldn’t hear anything. Then, suddenly, the shadows came together and formed a being. A creature with a black face and white eyes. The creature made an inhuman sound as it looked down at Julia while she laid on the bed convulsing. The monster reached down and grabbed Julia by the throat, lifting her up off of the bed. The monster started screamingas it began to drag her across the room in the dark.

	Julia wasn’t sure what was happening, but she knew that it was something terrible. All she could do now is pray that someone would come save her from this monstrous nightmare.

	Suddenly, everything went back to normal. Julia was left lying on the bed still having a seizure. It took another few seconds for Julia to come back from the shock of what just happened. She looked around expecting to see someone standing over her with a worried look on their face. But there was no one there. She was alone on her dark bedroom floor still convulsing uncontrollably.

	After another minute or so of shaking, Julia’s body finally calmed down. When she knew that she was done convulsing, she sat up on the floor and tried to catch her breath. She felt like there were needles stuck in her throat making it hard for her to breath. Her whole body ached from the recent seizure, and she had trouble getting herself off of the floor. It was even hard for Julia to speak, but she managed to say “No more” out loud.

	For Julia, this was just the most recent in a series of seizures that hadplagued her since she was a little girl. But this time was different from all the other times. She knew that whatever just happened had to do with what she saw in her vision.

	Julia got up on her feet and headed toward the other end of the hallway. She wanted to get away from the dark bedroom and take a look out each of her windows hoping for some kind of sign that someone was going to save her, but there was nothing out there except for darkness. So instead, Julia decided to take a shower so that she could at least feel clean again.

	When Julia came back downstairs and walked into the kitchen, she decided to walk by Thelma Bates’ room before going upstairs to her own room. As she was walking by Thelma’s door, there was a loud scream coming from inside the room. For a moment, Julia thought that Thelma Bates had just started having another major stroke.
	But then, Julia heard the sound of one of her grandmother’s medicine cups falling to the floor behind her bedroom door. When Julia turned around and looked at Thelma’s room, she saw her grandmother sitting in her wheelchair rocking back and forth. Thelma was crying hysterically Julia Martin has always been curious.

The monster reached down and grabbed Julia by the throat, lifting her up off of the bed. The monster started screamingas it began to drag her across the room in the dark.

	Julia wasn’t sure what was happening, but she knew that it was something terrible. All she could do now is pray that someone would come save her from this monstrous nightmare.

	Suddenly, everything went back to normal. Julia was left lying on the bed still having a seizure. It took another few seconds for Julia to come back from the shock of what just happened. She looked around expecting to see someone standing over her with a worried look on their face. But there was no one there. She was alone on her dark bedroom floor still convulsing uncontrollably.

	After another minute or so of shaking, Julia’s body finally calmed down. When she knew that she was done convulsing, she sat up on the floor and tried to catch her breath. She felt like there were needles stuck in her throat making it hard for her to breath. Her whole body ached from the recent seizure, and she had trouble getting herself off of the floor. It was even hard for Julia to speak, but she managed to say “No more” out loud.

	For Julia, this was just the most recent in a series of seizures that hadplagued her since she was a little girl. But this time was different from all the other times. She knew that whatever just happened had to do with what she saw in her vision.

	Julia got up on her feet and headed toward the other end of the hallway. She wanted to get away from the dark bedroom and take a look out each of her windows hoping for some kind of sign that someone was going to save her, but there was nothing out there except for darkness. So instead, Julia decided to take a shower so that she could at least feel clean again.

	When Julia came back downstairs and walked into the kitchen, she decided to walk by Thelma Bates’ room before going upstairs to her own room. As she was walking by Thelma’s door, there was a loud scream coming from inside the room. For a moment, Julia thought that Thelma Bates had just started having another major stroke.
	But then, Julia heard the sound of one of her grandmother’s medicine cups falling to the floor behind her bedroom door. When Julia turned around and looked at Thelma’s room, she saw her grandmother sitting in her wheelchair rocking back and forth. Thelma was crying hysterically Julia Martin has always been curious.

	She is an artist, painting in a style that is both abstract and realistic. Some of her paintings are ethereal, with bright colors in strange shapes that don’t seem to make sense. Other of her paintings are realistic, depicting actual scenes and objects. Julia paints the people she sees on the streets during her walks home from school one block away from her house, or the plants she sees hanging from trees along the way. But Julia always paints herself into her paintings; she rarely depicts herself as a child, but more often as an adult woman.
	And to add to her curiosity, Julia has never known a day of her life without suffering from seizures. At first they were simple, and took place so often that she stopped paying attention to them altogether. But then her seizures started becoming more frequent and more intense, until just a couple of months ago she began experiencing them every single day.

	Julia’s seizures also affect her creativity; often, after experiencing a seizure, Julia will not be able to paint for at least a week. She has even been in and out of hospital care because of the severity of her seizures. Her doctors have told her that there is very little hope infinding any sort of cure for her condition, and that they can only offer her pain management when she is having a seizure.
	But the worst part about Julia’s condition is not the pain or the disability. The worst part of all is that it’s making Julia go crazy.

	Julia has been suffering from seizures since she was just a child, but everything changed when she went to college.

	She had always been a social person, but something about the students at her college just didn’t connect with her. She tried to make friends, but every time she did things seemed to go terribly wrong. She suffered from constant ridicule by other students, who sometimes used their words to bully her, and sometimes used physical force. Once they even made a video of themselves throwing food at her while she was having a seizure.

	The night that the video was made Julia had just gotten home from college feeling awful about herself. She hadn’t been able to paint since her last seizure, and she had no idea what was going on with her artwork. It felt like all of the beauty from her paintings had disappeared, and they had become dull and lifeless.

	She began to think that this was why she was havingseizures. That the seizure itself was affecting her artwork, and making it less beautiful.

	Julia knew that something terrible was happening to her, but she didn’t know how to stop it or what to do about it.

	Suddenly, Julia started having a severe seizure. Her entire body began to shake, and she fell face first onto her bed. The whole world went black for a few minutes as her body continued shaking and convulsing uncontrollably. Julia was afraid that something terrible would happen to her at this moment. Who knows what damage could be done to an epileptic person while they were convulsing on their bed?

	When Julia came to, she opened her eyes and looked around the room. The world was still black, but she could see shapes moving in front of her. She thought it sounded like someone was trying to talk to her, but she couldn’t hear anything. Then, suddenly, the shadows came together and formed a being. A creature with a black face and white eyes. The creature made an inhuman sound as it looked down at Julia while she laid on the bed convulsing.

A group of survivors find themselves in a strange new world where they must band together to survive the perils that await them.,"most others. It would be the blood moon tonight, and that meant things would be different from now on. It meant that he would have the power to fulfill his life’s purpose and take over the world. He looked at his watch again and got up; it was time to go home.

	The man walked back into the woods, and after a few minutes of walking, he reached his cabin. He had built it himself when the world had been different; before everything went wrong. At first, he lived in a cave in the forest until he decided to build something better, stronger and permanent. It had been a big undertaking to build it all by himself, but he was proud of what he’d done. With one final kick of his foot against the dirt floor, he sat down and looked at where the deer had died.

	Suddenly, there was a bright light shining through the cabin’s window; instantly, everything became dark and quiet. The man looked around with his eyes wide open; he could hear people moving around in his cabin. His heart began to pound as he got up and tried to quietly walk over to the door in hopes of finding out who these intruders were. He reached the door and turned the handlequietly, trying not to make a sound that might alert them to his presence. The door opened easily, and when he looked inside, all he saw was a long hallway covered with darkness on either side.

	He took a few steps forward and nearly fell over when he felt someone grab hold of his arm tightly. He looked behind him, but he was alone. He looked ahead and saw a stairway that led up to a hallway; as he went up the stairs, more light seemed to come from inside of the cabin. He reached the top of the stairs, turned left and slowly walked down the hallway; he felt as though there were people all around him, watching him intently.

	He stopped for a moment because he could hear whispering coming from behind the door on his left. He looked through the small window in front of him at what was behind it, but it was too dark to see anything. He slowly walked closer to it and then quickly opened it quickly when he heard one of the strangers say, “He’s here!”

	He did not know what came over him, but he felt like he had to protect himself from them; maybe it was their size or their loud voices that disturbed him. He kicked oneof them in the head and then quickly ran away towards the stairway. As he turned around and looked down, he saw someone else come up behind him with a knife; he quickly threw something at the man’s face and then ran away down the stairs with the rest of the man’s friends chasing after him.

	As they all reached the bottom of the stairs, one of them shouted, “Hey you! Stop right there!” It was a woman, and she had a gun pointed at him. He turned around for just a second to see how many people were with her; there were three others behind her. The woman yelled again at him in a loud voice, “Stop right there, and drop your weapon!” The man stood there watching them carefully while holding onto the knife tightly. After he saw that they were all prepared for him, he decided to run away again.

	The man ran away as fast as he could down the hallway, but the woman with the gun was able to stay close behind him. “Don’t move!” she told him in a loud voice again, but he kept running away anyway. She began to chase after him, firing her gun at his sidewhenever she got close enough.

	After running for a few minutes, the man turned around and saw that he was starting to get further away from the people chasing after him. He knew they would never give up looking for him, so he needed to hide someplace until they gave up. He looked around nervously and tried to think where he could go. There was an office door down the hallway that had some papers stacked up against it; there was no one there, so he figured it might be a good place to hide. He walked over there slowly and tried to peek inside; the light was on in the room and he could see that there were some papers on the desk and in boxes on the floor. He slowly opened the door all the way so they couldn’t see him coming inside, and then crawled into the room quietly while holding onto his knife with both hands. The people outside were still yelling for him to stop, but he ignored them as much as he could. As he crawled into the room and began laying on his stomach, he could hear someone outside say that they should keep looking for him and not give up so easily; the man smiled and thought to himself that this might be the day that he finally got away from all of them.The only problem was that when the man raised himself up on his knees, he saw something on the floor in front of him that caught his eye; it was a pair of large metal claws attached to some kind of stick, and when he looked closer at them, he saw that they were attached to a large pair of steel-toed boots. From where he came into the room, the man had been crawling over what looked like a pile of dirty clothes, but now that he was on his knees he could see that they weren’t really clothes at all; they were pieces of dried meat dangling from the ceiling on some kind of weird meat hooks. The man was too shocked to move or yell out; he didn’t know what was going on, but it was obvious that he wasn’t where he wanted to be.

The man carefully stood up and backed away from the boots as far as he could, and as he did so, they began to move towards him. The man tried to move faster backwards but his foot got caught on a piece of clothing and he tripped, falling backwards onto the ground. Before the man could get up to run away again, he felt a burning pain in his calf and looked down;",0
"Kitty confronts Sergei and eventually solves the case, bringing the murderer to justice.","sit around and stay quiet!”

The two dogs turned around to look at Kitty, and then shook their heads in unison.

“Oh boy, that doesn’t look good. What is it that you don’t want to tell me, boys?”

“Kitty, I got to ask you a question. Did you know that the park used to be like a regular dog park, with lots of dogs and all playing together? And that it wasn’t like this before the killer came along – he started killing all the dogs who would come here.”

“That seems awful! Did you know who did it?”

“Well, I did! It was the black-and-white cat named Sergei Snipe, you know him right?”

Kitty was shocked by this information. “But that must mean he moved to our neighbourhood. Where is he now?”

Simon Bones moved closer to the park entrance, where he could see the traffic passing by and a few people walking their dogs.

“I saw him running around here before moving on elsewhere, I think. Let me tell you that killing those ten dogs was a big achievement for him. He moved to this area just to get more opportunities at dog murder.”

“Murder? Wait a minute, how did you know all of this?”

“Because I was there, remember. I saw it all happen with my own eyes.”

Kitty moved closer and leaned her head against his shoulder. “I’m sorry I didn’t believe you right away! It was so shocking when you told me that someone killed those dogs by throwing cats at them.”

Simon moved his right paw, trying to get Kitty’s attention. “The murders were even more shocking than that!” he said quietly. “They weren’t all killed by throwing cats at them. In fact, only one of the dogs was hit by a cat. Some were killed by a stone, which Sergei dropped from above. Others were killed with poisoned meatballs. The last one was bashed to death with a hammer.”

Kitty moved closer to him and looked up at his face. She put her left paw on his right shoulder and moved it slightly, indicating  that he was looking at the floor between his feet. “You’re right, my mistake! It was so shocking that I don’t remember everything exactly as it happened. I’m sorry!”

Sergei moved his left paw and rested it on Kitty’s shoulders. He moved it slightly to let her know that he was trying to tell her something. “It’s all right,” he said quietly. “I don’t mind you making mistakes as long as you don’t make them again! My head is still spinning from the shock of it.”

Kitty moved her right paw over Sergei’s left paw, then moved it to his face and pushed him gently, indicating that he should stop moving her paws around as she was talking to him.

Sergei moved his left paw off Kitty’s shoulders and moved it towards the door. “I think I’d better go home, I’m tired and hungry.” He moved his right paw towards the door as well, indicating that he wanted to go home with Sergei. “Me too, I need to eat; I haven ’t had dinner yet.” Kitty indicated to her left tummy with a short nod of her head, the universal signal for food.

Sergei pulled out a plastic bag from under the couch and made quick work of pulling out two cans of green food, which he handed over to Kitty. “I don’t like green food,” Kitty said. Sergei didn’t reply. He just kept moving his fingers in front of her face, indicating that he thought she should eat. She could tell that he was really hungry but knew that she would be even more hungry later if she didn’t enjoy her meal.

Kitty opened her mouth and took the food from Sergei’s extended paw, then quickly swallowed it once it was in her mouth. “You like green food, don’t you? You enjoyed your dinner, didn’t you?” Sergei said. Kitty nodded her head to confirm that he was right. Sergei gave a satisfied nod of his head and then turned around to look at the dogs. They were all staring directly at him, wondering why he killed their friends when they were just playing. They wondered why he threw them so hard that they went flying down  the hill. Kitty knew how they felt because she had been one of the dogs that Sergei threw down the hill and she had fallen into a pit filled with sharp sticks and metal spikes. She was lucky that she wasn’t killed or seriously injured, but she still had trouble walking every day because of her wounds.

Kitty didn’t say anything. She just kept looking at Sergei, waiting for him to explain why he did what he did. Sergei didn’t say anything either, but rather just stared at Kitty, wondering why she was staring at him so intently. Kitty then asked the question that had been bothering her for a long time. “Why did you do it? Why did you kill the dogs? Why couldn’t you just play with them, like the rest of the dogs did?” Sergei just looked at Kitty for a long time without saying anything.  Then he turned around and started walking away, thinking that he didn’t have to answer Kitty’s questions if he didn’t want to.

Kitty wasn’t happy about this answer. She wanted to know why Sergei killed the dogs, but now she knew that he just wasn’t going to tell her for some reason. It was obvious that he wasn’t going to say anything. He was just going to keep walking, and leave Kitty all alone again.

Fortunately for Kitty, however, Sergei hadn’t gone very far before he realized that there was something strange about his home. It felt different and smelled different than when he had been there earlier, and the door seemed to be closed. Sergei stopped walking at this point, but after a brief moment of thought, he decided to turn around and go back to the park because he didn’t know what else to do. All he really knew was that something was wrong, and that he didn’t really want to spend too much time in Sergei’s house by himself right now.

What Kitty didn’t know was that when she turned around to go home, she witnessed Captain Kiddo and the other policemen entering the park. They were all carrying their guns, and were very serious. They were all moving very quickly, and not even stopping to talk to any of the other dogs. They just walked right through the park in a straight line, headed for the dog houses on either side of it. The dogs didn’t like the looks of this at all, and moved away from them to get as far away as possible.

Sergei moved back very quickly, trying to get out of the park, too, but it was already too late for him. There was a loud noise and then Kitty  heard a gunshot, and she saw Sergei dropping to the ground. He didn’t move again. He was dead.

Kitty was very upset by this and began to move towards Sergei’s body, but Captain Kiddo ordered her to stop moving so she wouldn’t be hurt. He told Kitty to go back to her house right away, which she did.

She didn’t even look back for very long before she turned around and ran home as fast as she could. She didn’t tell anyone what had happened, either, because the police would be sure to find out soon enough anyway, and she didn’t think it was important that they know right away, either.

Kitty had been a very good detective in this case and she’d solved it all by herself, which made her very proud. Now she was just going to go home for the day so that she could rest and relax before her next big adventure. Kitty knew that she had to move on and be brave enough to accept her next case, and deal with whatever challenges it offered her, because that was what being a detective was all about. She knew that if she could do this, then she could be the best detective in the entire world and there couldn’t possibly be anything that could stop her.

Kitty’s house was very good for rest and relaxation, though, so she didn’t really mind being there at all. Kitty curled up on her favourite chair and just relaxed for a while, but before long she started to doze off, and before Kitty knew it, she was fast asleep.

Kitty’s sleep was filled with peaceful dreams, but they were soon interrupted by the sound of loud barking and she soon woke up. She opened her eyes and glanced around to see where she was, and then Kitty suddenly realised that she was home. She wasn’t in her favourite chair at all. In fact, Kitty had never even been in this chair before. She was at home, but her favourite chair was nowhere to be seen. It wasn’t anywhere else in the house either, and Kitty suddenly started to feel confused.

Kitty’s confusion soon turned to worry when she noticed that her house seemed smaller than it normally was, and that everything seemed to be a bit too far away. Kitty moved around the room and found that it was just as she had suspected; her house was smaller.",1

But then her seizures started becoming more frequent and more intense, until just a couple of months ago she began experiencing them every single day.

	Julia’s seizures also affect her creativity; often, after experiencing a seizure, Julia will not be able to paint for at least a week. She has even been in and out of hospital care because of the severity of her seizures. Her doctors have told her that there is very little hope infinding any sort of cure for her condition, and that they can only offer her pain management when she is having a seizure.
	But the worst part about Julia’s condition is not the pain or the disability. The worst part of all is that it’s making Julia go crazy.

	Julia has been suffering from seizures since she was just a child, but everything changed when she went to college.

	She had always been a social person, but something about the students at her college just didn’t connect with her. She tried to make friends, but every time she did things seemed to go terribly wrong. She suffered from constant ridicule by other students, who sometimes used their words to bully her, and sometimes used physical force. Once they even made a video of themselves throwing food at her while she was having a seizure.

	The night that the video was made Julia had just gotten home from college feeling awful about herself. She hadn’t been able to paint since her last seizure, and she had no idea what was going on with her artwork. It felt like all of the beauty from her paintings had disappeared, and they had become dull and lifeless.

	She began to think that this was why she was havingseizures. That the seizure itself was affecting her artwork, and making it less beautiful.

	Julia knew that something terrible was happening to her, but she didn’t know how to stop it or what to do about it.

	Suddenly, Julia started having a severe seizure. Her entire body began to shake, and she fell face first onto her bed. The whole world went black for a few minutes as her body continued shaking and convulsing uncontrollably. Julia was afraid that something terrible would happen to her at this moment. Who knows what damage could be done to an epileptic person while they were convulsing on their bed?

	When Julia came to, she opened her eyes and looked around the room. The world was still black, but she could see shapes moving in front of her. She thought it sounded like someone was trying to talk to her, but she couldn’t hear anything. Then, suddenly, the shadows came together and formed a being. A creature with a black face and white eyes. The creature made an inhuman sound as it looked down at Julia while she laid on the bed convulsing. The monster reached down and grabbed Julia by the throat, lifting her up off of the bed. The monster started screamingas it began to drag her across the room in the dark.

	Julia wasn’t sure what was happening, but she knew that it was something terrible. All she could do now is pray that someone would come save her from this monstrous nightmare.

	Suddenly, everything went back to normal. Julia was left lying on the bed still having a seizure. It took another few seconds for Julia to come back from the shock of what just happened. She looked around expecting to see someone standing over her with a worried look on their face. But there was no one there. She was alone on her dark bedroom floor still convulsing uncontrollably.

	After another minute or so of shaking, Julia’s body finally calmed down. When she knew that she was done convulsing, she sat up on the floor and tried to catch her breath. She felt like there were needles stuck in her throat making it hard for her to breath. Her whole body ached from the recent seizure, and she had trouble getting herself off of the floor. It was even hard for Julia to speak, but she managed to say “No more” out loud.

	For Julia, this was just the most recent in a series of seizures that hadplagued her since she was a little girl. But this time was different from all the other times. She knew that whatever just happened had to do with what she saw in her vision.

	Julia got up on her feet and headed toward the other end of the hallway. She wanted to get away from the dark bedroom and take a look out each of her windows hoping for some kind of sign that someone was going to save her, but there was nothing out there except for darkness. So instead, Julia decided to take a shower so that she could at least feel clean again.

	When Julia came back downstairs and walked into the kitchen, she decided to walk by Thelma Bates’ room before going upstairs to her own room. As she was walking by Thelma’s door, there was a loud scream coming from inside the room. For a moment, Julia thought that Thelma Bates had just started having another major stroke.
	But then, Julia heard the sound of one of her grandmother’s medicine cups falling to the floor behind her bedroom door. When Julia turned around and looked at Thelma’s room, she saw her grandmother sitting in her wheelchair rocking back and forth. Thelma was crying hysterically",0
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,"side door. She stood behind the reception desk for several seconds, listening closely, trying to determine whether she could hear anyone inside. There was the murmur of voices in the background and maybe even some faint music, but she couldn’t make out any actual words.

	With that information, she slowly made her way to the back of the desk where there was a small supply closet and waited there in complete silence for several minutes. She didn’t really care that she had snuck into her own building through an unlocked door or that she was hiding in a supply closet – it seemed appropriate in some way – but she did want to make sure she wasn’t being followed. She made no noise except for the soft padding of her feet on the carpet flooring, trying to keep them quiet enough that they couldn’t be heard from within the room.

	After what seemed like an eternity, and was probably only a few minutes, she saw someone come out of the bathroom and into view near the reception desk. It was Kyle. He smiled at her when he saw her and motioned for her to come out of the closet and follow him.

	She stood up from behind the desk and walked towards him. She took a deepbreath as she tried to steady her nerves, but as soon as she passed the threshold of the closet, her anxiety shot through the roof. The voices in the other room were talking and laughing loudly, music was playing loudly as well, and there were several people crowded near the counter; one of them even had their arm around Kyle’s waist.

	The only thing that kept her from running out of there was the look on Kyle’s face – he looked so happy to see her. The thought of disappointing him, or hurting his feelings, held her in place as she walked towards him; it also helped that he was blocking everyone else from the closet so they couldn’t see her.

	“Hey!” he said excitedly as she came around the corner, and pulled her in for a big hug. She returned his embrace with one of her own, happy to see him as well, even if this wasn’t how she wanted to see him. He kissed her cheek and put his arm around her, letting it linger there for a moment before letting go again. His attention was already on someone else, on a woman who was standing not too far from them; it seemed like she was trying to get his attention, and Kyle was happy to oblige.

	“Hi,” he said as they separated. “This is Aimee.”

	Aimee smiled as she shook Kyle’s hand, and then looked up to smile at him as well. He had a boyish charm about him that she couldn’t help but find endearing, but he didn’t seem the least bit interested in her. She felt a pang of hurt inside at the thought of being rejected so easily, but Kyle was already saying something else to her that caught her attention.

	“I wanted you to meet someone. This is Patricia; we work together at the hospital. This is Aimee.”

	Kyle did not go into any further explanation about Patricia or what she does at the hospital, and although Aimee felt hurt she decided not to push the issue; there were other things that were much more pressing at the moment.

	“Have you come here to join us?” Patricia asked Aimee, moving close enough for them to touch and smiling warmly at her.

	Aimee smiled back, feeling comfortable in Patricia’s company. “Kyleinvited me over because I haven’t been going to the club since my divorce. He told me I should come hang out with people who understand me.”

	Patricia put her arm around Aimee and squeezed her gently.

	“We do understand you, don’t we?” Patricia said gently, and her eyes locked on Aimee’s for a moment before turning back to Kyle. “You told me about her at the club. I thought it was very noble of you to offer her a home away from home... or a place to belong or whatever it was you said.”

	Aimee could feel herself blushing at the praise, and she looked over toward Kyle. He seemed to be in a world of his own as he smiled at Patricia while listening to Aimee talk about herself.

	“Thank you,” she said to Kyle after a moment, smiling shyly at him. “I think your club really is a good idea for me. I think I can offer some of the younger people there something they might not have experienced yet and that could be very beneficial for their growth as young adults.”“My pleasure,” Kyle said as he looked up from the television and shifted his attention toward Aimee. “I think you’ll be a great help to us with the youth group here. The kids are dying for someone their own age to talk to, and I think you can fill that void.”

	Aimee nodded enthusiastically. “I never had anyone my age to talk to when I was growing up,” she said, “and it definitely stunted my development socially... but I think talking to them is the least I can do... and what better way than by sharing my experiences with them?”

	Aimee felt like she was rambling because she had run out of things to say, but Kyle just smiled at her and raised his glass in a toast. Patricia followed suit, but it seemed to Aimee that there was more meaning in her gesture than Kyle’s.

	“Here’s to helping the kids,” Kyle said with a smile, and both Aimee and Patricia responded by raising their glasses as well.

	“Speaking of which,” Aimee said once she had set her glass down",0
"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.","“Hello? Liam?” She said as she waved at him.
	He looked over at Jenna with an annoyed expression on his face. “What do you want?” He asked sarcastically.
	The sarcasm irritated her slightly, but she didn’t show it. “I just wanted to say thank you for saving me when I was being attacked a few weeks ago. I couldn’t have done it without your help.”
	Liam looked taken aback by the compliment and paused for a few seconds before answering. “Don’t mention it, I don’t know what came over me when I saw that you were in trouble, but I just had to help you. It might have been a bad decision on my part since now I am being hunted by some guy because of it.”
	Jenna frowned when she heard this and looked down in shame. “I am sorry Liam, I didn’t think that it would come to this. I will do anything that I can to help you get rid of your attacker... please don’t kill me!”
	Liam laughed a little at the request that Jenna made and said,“I don’t think that I would ever want to kill you Jenna. You are much too pretty, but if your attacker gets past me I can’t guarantee that my next move is going to be as kind.”
	Jenna smiled brightly at him and said, “I will do whatever it takes to stay out of trouble. I don’t want anyone else getting hurt because of my actions.”
	Liam looked at her and smiled back, “I know you will Jenna. You are a good girl and your attacker is lucky to have you as an enemy.”
	Jenna blushed when she heard this compliment and then grew concerned again when she saw that two men were approaching Liam. “You should go now Liam, this is not your problem, I will be fine!”
	Liam shook his head, “I don’t think so Jenna. Besides these guys look harmless enough, but I will let you see them from a safe distance before you make up your mind about them.”
	The two men stopped when they saw Liam standing in front of the two of them and said in unison, “Good evening Mr. Cross;are you enjoying your night?”
	Liam laughed at their corny line and replied, “Yeah I am having a great time. How about you guys, did you come here to have fun tonight?”
	The two men smiled at each other and replied simultaneously, “No, we came to protect you Mr. Cross!”
	Jenna frowned at this response and said in disgust, “You mean you came here to keep me safe from danger?”
	The two men nodded their heads at her with a smile and continued to follow Liam closely as he walked away.
	Jenna followed them closely until they went through a black curtain into what appeared to be another room inside of the castle. When she saw that Liam was still unharmed she breathed a sigh of relief and continued to walk towards the entrance where there wasn’t any sign of her attacker. This made Jenna wonder if they had just been sent by Gregory to be there as a precautionary measure or if they were there because someone was threatening him. Either way Jenna didn’t want to cause any trouble for Gregory, so she quickly walked past his table to head towards the dance floor where there were many people having fun anddancing.
	Music played loudly and the crowd danced wildly to every beat. Jenna took off her coat and put it on the nearest chair so that she could dance freely while still being able to keep an eye on her surroundings at all times. After seeing that none of the people around her were a threat she began to have some fun herself and started dancing with some of the men who asked, but none of them could match up to Liam’s dancing style. He was her hero and savior after all so he deserved a special treat in honor of his name day.
	For the next hour Jenna enjoyed herself by dancing and mingling with some of the other guests while keeping an eye on Liam who remained stationary at his seat with a smile on his face watching her. She saw that he winked at her once in a while and continued to drink from his glass every time it got low without getting up. She knew that he was waiting for her to make some kind of move on him even though she was supposed to be the shy and helpless girl because that’s what he wanted to feel powerful.
	When one of the girls who had asked her for a dance had gotten drunk, Jenna decided that it was time to leave before she ended up being accusedof something that she would never do. She started to make her way through the crowd but Liam stood up before she could reach him and walked toward her.
	“What are you doing here?” Jenna asked while pulling away from the man who had been dancing with her.
	“I thought I told you that I would come and visit you. It wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t at least say happy name day, right?”
	“Happy name day? Is it your birthday or something? I can’t believe I wasted all this time on you when I should have been at home by now,” she said while turning towards the entrance of the club.
	Liam grabbed her arm and held on to it tightly before walking with her through the crowd and out of the club. He stopped only to open the door for her and then they were outside in the parking lot, standing in front of his car.
	“What are you doing? You just told me that it was your name day not even five minutes ago!”
	He ignored her and stood in front of her blocking all of her attempts to move past him. “I am not leaving until you come with me,” he said in a serious voice.",0
A group of survivors find themselves holed up in an old house in the middle of nowhere.,"The year was 2020, and the place was a small town named Newberry, Ohio. A few
   weeks earlier, the entire world had been hit by a deadly pandemic. The virus
   first attacked the lungs and led to pneumonia. From there it attacked the rest of
   the body, killing every human on the planet within a month.

   A few weeks after the world had been infected, some people began to show
   immunity to the virus. They were immune because they had been exposed to it
   once before, during a minor outbreak ten years earlier.

   The few people who were immune were called “the immune” by the remaining
   humans. These immune humans took over the government and ordered the human
   race to rebuild and repopulate the earth.

   They told everyone else to stay in their homes and remain calm, as there
   was no need to panic anymore. They reassured people that help was on the
   way, and that any remaining humans would be picked up by helicopters and
   taken to a nearby field hospital.

   Unfortunately, all of this was a lie; the immune had their ownagenda,
   which they were keeping secret.

   The immune were a small group of affluent people who had been secretly
   funding medical research and acquiring patents for new biochemical weapons
   for years. They knew far more about the virus than anyone else, and had
   deliberately infected the entire population with it to create an army of
   slaves and soldiers for them to rule over.

   It would take them years to build up their numbers, but once they had an
   army of millions they considered themselves invincible.

   The army they were building was called “The Swarm”. Once it was large enough,
   they planned to raid the fields hospital and wipe out the rest of the human
   race.

   They also planned to kidnap a small group of children and raise them in their
   image; brainwashed, emotionally numb robots who would do whatever they were
   told without hesitation. The children were being kidnapped from their parents
   and homes all over the United States, while their families slept in blissful
   ignorance.

   The kidnapped children were taken to a place called “The Hive”, where theywere being conditioned to be perfect servants. They were living in small,
   cramped rooms and barely fed enough food to stay alive. Their hair was shorn
   off, and a tracking device was implanted in each of them.

   If any of them tried to escape they would face the same fate as Jennifer
   Lopez and her friends. They would be captured and dragged back to the Hive
   for punishment.

   When Jennifer’s group discovered the abandoned house they tried to make it
   into a home sweet home. They spent the next few weeks scavenging for food
   and supplies, trying to find some sort of life among the rubble of society.

  The only one who seemed genuinely happy was Jennifer Lopez. She loved
  being outside, even though it was extremely cold. It reminded her of when she
  had been a child, riding her bicycle through the park with her mother and
  father.

 Everyone else just tried to stay as warm as possible and made sure not to go
  too far from the houses. The worst thing they could imagine was getting lost
  out here in the darkness of night.Jennifer had a feeling that the Swarm, her captors, were hunting them,
  but she never let it get to her. She didn’t want to stress herself out with
  something like that when there was nothing she could do about it.

  One day, as Jennifer was walking around outside, she heard someone call
  her name. She spun around to see who it was, but when she turned back around
  to face the voice, there was nobody there. But Jennifer knew that it had been
  Johnathan Hill calling for her. He was dead; he’d been shot by security guards
  before Jennifer was captured.

 “Johnathan?”, she asked herself aloud. “Is that you?”

 She heard his voice again and started walking towards where she had heard it.

 “Johnathan?”, she asked again as she made her way over to a large boulder.

 “Come alone and no one gets hurt,” Johnathan’s voice called from behind it.

  Jennifer turned around and there he was, leaning against the rock with his
  arms folded across his chest. For a moment her heart skipped a beat,but then
  Jennifer regained her composure and asked, “What are you doing here?”

 He just smiled at her and said, “You know what I’m doing here. Do you want to
  join me inside?”

 She hesitated for a moment and looked around the area to make sure no one was
  watching, then nodded her head.

 “Meet me at the park in two days time. Don’t bring anyone,” he said with a sly
  smile on his face.

 Jennifer gave him another nod and turned around to leave so that she wouldn’t be
  seen talking to anyone.

 As she left the area, she felt someone watching her, but by the time she had
  reached her destination, lost sight of whoever it might have been.

 She returned to the house that she had been hiding in for over two weeks and
  told Willow about what had just happened. Willow was shocked at first, but then
  she went straight into action mode. They had almost been caught before and
  they wouldn’t be careless enough to let that happen again.

 Jennifer wasn’t very happy about leaving the house either, but",1
"Kitty confronts Sergei and eventually solves the case, bringing the murderer to justice.","sit around and stay quiet!”

The two dogs turned around to look at Kitty, and then shook their heads in unison.

“Oh boy, that doesn’t look good. What is it that you don’t want to tell me, boys?”

“Kitty, I got to ask you a question. Did you know that the park used to be like a regular dog park, with lots of dogs and all playing together? And that it wasn’t like this before the killer came along – he started killing all the dogs who would come here.”

“That seems awful! Did you know who did it?”

“Well, I did! It was the black-and-white cat named Sergei Snipe, you know him right?”

Kitty was shocked by this information. “But that must mean he moved to our neighbourhood. Where is he now?”

Simon Bones moved closer to the park entrance, where he could see the traffic passing by and a few people walking their dogs.

“I saw him running around here before moving on elsewhere, I think. Let me tell you that killing those ten dogs was a big achievement for him. He moved to this area just to get more opportunities at dog murder.”

“Murder? Wait a minute, how did you know all of this?”

“Because I was there, remember. I saw it all happen with my own eyes.”

Kitty moved closer and leaned her head against his shoulder. “I’m sorry I didn’t believe you right away! It was so shocking when you told me that someone killed those dogs by throwing cats at them.”

Simon moved his right paw, trying to get Kitty’s attention. “The murders were even more shocking than that!” he said quietly. “They weren’t all killed by throwing cats at them. In fact, only one of the dogs was hit by a cat. Some were killed by a stone, which Sergei dropped from above. Others were killed with poisoned meatballs. The last one was bashed to death with a hammer.”

Kitty moved closer to him and looked up at his face. She put her left paw on his right shoulder and moved it slightly, indicating  that he was looking at the floor between his feet. “You’re right, my mistake! It was so shocking that I don’t remember everything exactly as it happened. I’m sorry!”

Sergei moved his left paw and rested it on Kitty’s shoulders. He moved it slightly to let her know that he was trying to tell her something. “It’s all right,” he said quietly. “I don’t mind you making mistakes as long as you don’t make them again! My head is still spinning from the shock of it.”

Kitty moved her right paw over Sergei’s left paw, then moved it to his face and pushed him gently, indicating that he should stop moving her paws around as she was talking to him.

Sergei moved his left paw off Kitty’s shoulders and moved it towards the door. “I think I’d better go home, I’m tired and hungry.” He moved his right paw towards the door as well, indicating that he wanted to go home with Sergei. “Me too, I need to eat; I haven ’t had dinner yet.” Kitty indicated to her left tummy with a short nod of her head, the universal signal for food.

Sergei pulled out a plastic bag from under the couch and made quick work of pulling out two cans of green food, which he handed over to Kitty. “I don’t like green food,” Kitty said. Sergei didn’t reply. He just kept moving his fingers in front of her face, indicating that he thought she should eat. She could tell that he was really hungry but knew that she would be even more hungry later if she didn’t enjoy her meal.

Kitty opened her mouth and took the food from Sergei’s extended paw, then quickly swallowed it once it was in her mouth. “You like green food, don’t you? You enjoyed your dinner, didn’t you?” Sergei said. Kitty nodded her head to confirm that he was right. Sergei gave a satisfied nod of his head and then turned around to look at the dogs. They were all staring directly at him, wondering why he killed their friends when they were just playing. They wondered why he threw them so hard that they went flying down  the hill. Kitty knew how they felt because she had been one of the dogs that Sergei threw down the hill and she had fallen into a pit filled with sharp sticks and metal spikes. She was lucky that she wasn’t killed or seriously injured, but she still had trouble walking every day because of her wounds.

Kitty didn’t say anything. She just kept looking at Sergei, waiting for him to explain why he did what he did. Sergei didn’t say anything either, but rather just stared at Kitty, wondering why she was staring at him so intently. Kitty then asked the question that had been bothering her for a long time. “Why did you do it? Why did you kill the dogs? Why couldn’t you just play with them, like the rest of the dogs did?” Sergei just looked at Kitty for a long time without saying anything.  Then he turned around and started walking away, thinking that he didn’t have to answer Kitty’s questions if he didn’t want to.

Kitty wasn’t happy about this answer. She wanted to know why Sergei killed the dogs, but now she knew that he just wasn’t going to tell her for some reason. It was obvious that he wasn’t going to say anything. He was just going to keep walking, and leave Kitty all alone again.

Fortunately for Kitty, however, Sergei hadn’t gone very far before he realized that there was something strange about his home. It felt different and smelled different than when he had been there earlier, and the door seemed to be closed. Sergei stopped walking at this point, but after a brief moment of thought, he decided to turn around and go back to the park because he didn’t know what else to do. All he really knew was that something was wrong, and that he didn’t really want to spend too much time in Sergei’s house by himself right now.

What Kitty didn’t know was that when she turned around to go home, she witnessed Captain Kiddo and the other policemen entering the park. They were all carrying their guns, and were very serious. They were all moving very quickly, and not even stopping to talk to any of the other dogs. They just walked right through the park in a straight line, headed for the dog houses on either side of it. The dogs didn’t like the looks of this at all, and moved away from them to get as far away as possible.

Sergei moved back very quickly, trying to get out of the park, too, but it was already too late for him. There was a loud noise and then Kitty  heard a gunshot, and she saw Sergei dropping to the ground. He didn’t move again. He was dead.

Kitty was very upset by this and began to move towards Sergei’s body, but Captain Kiddo ordered her to stop moving so she wouldn’t be hurt. He told Kitty to go back to her house right away, which she did.

She didn’t even look back for very long before she turned around and ran home as fast as she could. She didn’t tell anyone what had happened, either, because the police would be sure to find out soon enough anyway, and she didn’t think it was important that they know right away, either.

Kitty had been a very good detective in this case and she’d solved it all by herself, which made her very proud. Now she was just going to go home for the day so that she could rest and relax before her next big adventure. Kitty knew that she had to move on and be brave enough to accept her next case, and deal with whatever challenges it offered her, because that was what being a detective was all about. She knew that if she could do this, then she could be the best detective in the entire world and there couldn’t possibly be anything that could stop her.

Kitty’s house was very good for rest and relaxation, though, so she didn’t really mind being there at all. Kitty curled up on her favourite chair and just relaxed for a while, but before long she started to doze off, and before Kitty knew it, she was fast asleep.

Kitty’s sleep was filled with peaceful dreams, but they were soon interrupted by the sound of loud barking and she soon woke up. She opened her eyes and glanced around to see where she was, and then Kitty suddenly realised that she was home. She wasn’t in her favourite chair at all. In fact, Kitty had never even been in this chair before. She was at home, but her favourite chair was nowhere to be seen. It wasn’t anywhere else in the house either, and Kitty suddenly started to feel confused.

Kitty’s confusion soon turned to worry when she noticed that her house seemed smaller than it normally was, and that everything seemed to be a bit too far away. Kitty moved around the room and found that it was just as she had suspected; her house was smaller.",1
Brad realizes the error of his ways and comes to appreciate Shannon for the wonderful woman she was.,"found out from his mother that his father had been released from the hospital and was doing okay, he started to feel guilty for lying to her about where he was going this past week.

	Brad had told him that it wasn’t a big deal to lie to someone in his or her own family, but Jeremy didn’t agree with him. He knew he would have never forgiven himself if something had happened to his dad while Jeremy was lying to him and didn’t know about it.

	He also figured that he deserved the lecture his mother was going to give him when they got home because of his lying...he just hoped it wasn’t going to be too bad. He knew that lying was wrong, even though Brad told him it wasn’t.

	When they pulled into their driveway, Jeremy felt really tired. He sat in the driveway while his mother parked her car in the garage and took her bag out of the trunk. He leaned forward on his seat and rested his head against the headrest as he stared up into space for a moment, trying to imagine how Brad must have felt just before he had learned that Shannon was dead.

	He wondered if Brad had ever loved Shannon sincerely, or if he hadjust been using her for his own purposes. He wondered if he would ever be able to love anyone as much as Brad had loved Shannon, or even half as much...maybe not even a quarter of that. He wondered if Brad truly realized what an incredible woman she was and had been, and how he would have felt if he had died knowing that his wife was dead because she couldn’t bear the thought of going on without him.

	Jeremy sighed as he looked up at the dark sky and saw a shooting star go by over his head. He closed his eyes and wished that things were different between him and his mom, and between him and his dad. He wished that he could see Brad again, but he knew it wasn’t going to happen for a very long time – maybe not for several years.

	Finally, when he thought about it that way, he began to realize how much guilt really would have eaten him up if something bad had happened while he was away. And at the same time, he realized that his mother might never forgive him if something did happen to Jeremy while she knew where he was but kept quiet about it.

	So in the end, Jeremy decided that maybe what Brad said about lying wasn’t sobad. But only a little bit. Still, he was glad to be back home, no matter how much it would take him to get used to his old routine again.

Brad Barton did not understand why his son felt guilty about having lied to him. He had lied to Shannon too and, once upon a time, to his father and mother too – and they had forgiven him for all of them. He figured he would eventually be able to forgive Jeremy too. He certainly hoped he would, because it grieved him to think of his son suffering as he had suffered when his first wife had died.

	He remembered how good Shannon was in bed, and how she could always make him feel better when he was upset. She was a true friend too and no matter what problem he came to her with, she always seemed to find a way of making it better.

He also remembered how sweet she smelled when he first went to her bed at night...like honey and flowers mixed together. He had missed those things a lot, but he figured if they were still too painful for Jeremy to deal with, he would wait until later to ask him about them.

They both needed some time away from each other first anyway. They had been through toomuch together in such a short time, and it was bound to take them some time to settle back into their old routine. He did not mind waiting a little while longer for Jeremy to share his secrets with him. In the meantime, he hoped that he would be able to make Shannon proud of him by regaining the respect of his son.

Brad could see that it would take some time for his son to get used to having him around again and that was fine by Brad, because being around was all he wanted at the moment.

	He made a bee-line for the liquor cabinet where he kept his old bottle of scotch. He poured himself a stiff drink and took a long sip from the glass. 	“That’s good,” he said, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand in an attempt to catch some of the dribble that had escaped onto his chin.

He was glad that Jeremy had stayed behind to take care of the house while he was gone because otherwise Brad might have gotten too drunk to notice what was going on around him – and there were a lot of things that needed his attention.

	First, he checked the answering machine to see if anyone had called while he was away. There were two messages from Shannon’s mother Karen, who was still trying to get in touch with him. Brad hit the delete button and decided that he would rather not talk to her, at least for the time being.

His next stop was the kitchen where he went through all of the drawers looking for anything that belonged to Shannon. He found some pictures from their wedding and other random photographs that brought back so many memories for him. His favorites were the ones of Shannon and Jeremy together because they made him realize how much he missed them both. When he saw a picture of himself holding Shannon in his arms on their wedding day, all of the anger and resentment that had built up inside of him dissipated and he began to feel like himself again.

Tears ran freely down his face as he picked up Shannon’s picture from their wedding day, kissed it gently on her lips, and then held it next to his heart. Brad cried until there were no more tears left in him. The tears flowed unashamedly because he knew that there would be no one watching him this time as he wept over the death of his beloved wife.

When he finally stopped crying, Brad took a long look at himself in the mirrorand realized that he had been a fool. Shannon was the best thing that had ever happened to him and he had taken her for granted. He now knew that he would never find another woman who loved him as much as Shannon had and he vowed to never take her love for granted again.

Brad went into Jeremy’s room and found him fast asleep in his bed. He sat down on the edge of the bed and watched his son sleep for a few minutes before gently kissing him on the forehead and tucking him in. Brad then went into his own bedroom, undressed, and got into bed where he finally allowed himself to fall asleep.",1
"Shannon's father dies and her first book fails, leading her to doubt her talent.","Shannon Chambers’ eyes were shut tightly. Her lips were pursed together. She was clutching a pillow with one hand while the other was pressed against her forehead. It felt like there was an ice cube on top of her head. She took in a deep breath and released it slowly, trying to relax herself. The pain was gone but the feeling of loss still remained, as it had since her father passed away two months ago.

Shannon squeezed her eyes shut. Tears started to well up in them. She tried desperately to fight them back but they eventually seeped through. She let out a small sob and held her father’s pillow closer.

She was about to cry even more when her mother, who was lying next to her in the bed, opened her eyes. Shannon froze.

“Shannon? Are you crying?”

Shannon nodded, sniffling quietly. Her mother laid her father’s head right on top of Shannon’s body.

Shannon placed both arms around her father’s head and hugged him tightly. His head was still cold to the touch but she welcomed it, hoping that it would keep her warm for a while.  She pressed her cheek against him, sniffling again as she tried to get herself together.

She looked up at her mother and saw a sad smile on her face. Shannon wiped the tears from her eyes and said, “I miss him so much.”

“I know you do, honey. But he’s not in any pain anymore. He’s not suffering. And you will see him again, hopefully sooner than later. You will now have two guides to help you along the way until the day comes when we are all reunited with our loved ones.”

Shannon moved her arms out from around her father’s head but hugged him again. “What guides?”

Her mother kissed her on the cheek and said, “Your books will be your guides now. They will lead you on a path made of words and stories that will provide both comfort and information until the day we are all reunited.”

Now Shannon looked up at her agent and saw that she too was crying softly. “What happened?” Shannon asked, wiping her own tears away with the sleeve of her sweatshirt. “Why are you all crying?”

Her agent took a couple of deep breaths and said, “I’m sorry, Shannon. I really am. I’m so sorry. But the publisher can’t publish your book as is. And they don’t want to make any  changes or adjustments to it.”

Shannon looked at her with a stunned face and said, “What are you talking about?”

Her agent wiped away more of her tears and explained, “I showed the publisher your first draft. And once they read it, they said it was terrible.”

Shannon’s mouth dropped open in shock. “Terrible? What do you mean? Are you saying that it isn’t any good? That I suck as an author? That I should give up and become a waitress?”

Her agent looked Shannon in the eye and said, “No. Of course not! Don’t be silly, Shannon. This is just a bump in the road. You’re going to be fine. You just need to let this one go and move on to the next project. You’ll do great with that one!”

Shannon closed her eyes. She breathed deeply. She opened her eyes again and said, “Move on? Move on to what? What ever happened to my books needing me? What ever happened to their begging me to write them? What happened  to the stories that were desperate to be told?”

Her agent’s eyes widened. “You haven’t talked to them yet? You really do need some rest. I think it might be best if you went home today and rested for a bit. Now, don’t worry about this one. I’m going to talk to the publisher and they will change their minds. You just take care of yourself right now and we’ll get back on track in no time.”

Shannon forced a smile. “Thanks, Sam. I guess I knew that, but I just needed to hear it from you.”

Her agent smiled back. “Of course! Whenever you need me. Just remember that I’m here for you whenever you call.”

Shannon nodded and said, “I know. Thanks. I really do have to go home now.” Shannon stood up and gave her agent a hug. “I’ll get through this,” she said quietly to herself as she walked out of the office.

Her agent said, “Shannon? Shannon! Where are you going? We need to talk about what publisher to approach for your next book.”

Shannon sighed. “I’ll think about it and let you know when I get home later, okay?”

Her agent smiled again. “Alright, honey. Do whatever you want. I have some work",0
The world ends in a cataclysmic event.,"In a dark and grimy room, ten people huddled together on a dirty, old and worn-out mattress. The room was not much bigger than a prison cell. It was so small that it was hard to move around without bumping into the others.
	The ten people were dressed in rags and they all looked to be tired and hungry.  Their clothes were black or brown from the dirty marks that were all over them and their hair was dirt-covered and greasy.
	The people were all male, except for one woman. They were all middle-aged or older men. All of the men had tough and rugged faces that showed their years of hard work in the sun and wind. Most of their faces also showed cuts, scrapes, bruises, burns, cuts and scars from being beaten by other people.
	Two of the men had their right hands held tightly in a grip of iron from a wooden stick that was behind their backs.  These two men looked different than the others in the dirty room. They were clearly rich and important men before the apocalypse from what their clothes showed.
	Their clothes were expensive and well crafted. One of the men had on a full suit made out of black cloth with a darkbrown vest and a light gray tie. The other man had on a white coat that was torn at the shoulders, revealing his brown chest, which was covered in dirt and dirt-filled cuts.
	The ten people were huddled together in the small room to hide from the dangerous outside world. Their weapons were close by to protect them from any danger that would threaten their lives. The room was filled with several buckets that were used for collecting water leaks and one large barrel for storing water. The room also had several wooden crates that were used as beds. The group of survivors used the top of the barrels as a table where they ate and did their work from.
	The room was located deep underground in an old cave. The small door that they came in through was heavily guarded by iron bars and had a locked padlock on it to keep wild animals out.
	But worst of all, there was no sunlight in the room and it was dark and depressing.  There wasn’t even a single candle to give off some light for them to see by.
	The people didn’t know if they would ever be able to escape from the underground prison that they were trapped in.
	The world had changed but this group of survivors livedin harmony with nature. They depended on the forest to survive, and were completely oblivious to what was going on in the outside worl. They were happy and content with their lives, even though they didn’t have any idea what was happening in the outside world with all the chaos that was going on around them.
	It was a beautiful day outside and all the animals came out into the forest to enjoy it. The birds sang their merry song, bees buzzed around catching pollen from flowers, deer walked in the meadows eating flowers.  But this day of peace and joy was about to end as a man with red eyes showed up among the animals of nature. He grabbed a young fawn that was playing with its mother and ripped it open like a piece of paper. He swallowed its blood like it was a sweet delicacy to him.
	He went around looking for more food for himself, hunting every animal he could find that would get in his way. He ate their hearts, livers, kidneys and everything else that he could get his hands on. He killed young deer and ate their blood and entrails. He had no mercy for any creature that crossed his path; they were all in danger by the man with red eyes.The animals didn’t have a chance against him, they ran and squealed to their deaths; he killed them all without batting an eye. He was unstoppable. The end of the animals in the forest was near. The man with red eyes laughed as he watched each one of them die for him; he loved killing and torturing animals and this was his heaven on earth.
	However, there were some that had a chance of escaping him, but only if they acted quickly.
 	Once he was through with the forest, he marched into the woods. The leaves danced merrily as he walked across them; he didn’t disturb anything in his path because it was so perfect. Everything was exactly as it should be in this forest. He wanted to stay here forever and never have to leave it again, but he knew that wasn’t possible for him because a special day was coming soon.
 	He walked on until he reached a small cabin in the woods near a stream. It looked like a decent place to stay so he went inside and found what he needed for shelter from the elements, along with some food. He went outside and put up tarps to cover the windows of the cabin so no one couldsee him inside. Then he sat down beside the stream and ate his dinner. He noticed a deer in the distance; it was too far for him to shoot, but he didn’t need to worry about that because it was almost time.
	He looked at his watch and saw that a few minutes had passed since he had last checked; it was now time. He picked up his rifle and stood in front of the deer. It was staring at him with frightened eyes; he took aim and shot it in the head, killing it instantly. It fell onto its side as blood began to spill out. The man smiled as he watched the animal’s life leave its body; it was beautiful. Quickly, he went over and tore open the animal’s stomach with his bare hands. He scooped out its entrails and ate them before drinking its blood. The taste was fresh and sweet; he loved doing this because it gave him strength and power over other animals. He drank every drop of it until the animal was finished. Then he rested and waited for nightfall.
	The moon rose high into the sky as night approached; it was a beautiful sight to see every time he saw it, but this night was more special than In a dark and grimy room, ten people huddled together on a dirty, old and worn-out mattress.

"Shannon commits suicide, leaving her husband and young son behind.","few days for Brad to realize that she was gone, so he would probably be distraught and miserable by the time he got home. She thought that it was only fair. Brad had ruined her life for the past three years, and now it was her turn to ruin his.

In addition, Karen figured that Dan Barton and Brad’s father Jeremy Barton wouldn’t mind it if their son were to suffer a bit considering everything he had done to them. After all, they were still upset with Brad about the accident that had killed their daughter Shannon and injured their grandson Jeremy. They would probably be even more unhappy with him if they knew about his affair.

Meanwhile, Dan was walking through the airport parking lot and trying to find Brad’s car. As she was browsing through the rows of cars, she heard another voice say her name. She turned around and saw a man who appeared to be in his mid-twenties standing in front of her. Dan had never met the man before, so she was surprised to see him here at the airport with her.

The man walked up to Dan and held out his hand for her to shake. “I’m sorry for your loss,” he said to her. “My name is Jeremy Barton. I’m Sarah’s husband.” The moment Karen saw the man, she realized that Sarah was Brad’s mistress. She had been trying to keep the fact that Shannon had killed herself a secret from everyone, so she didn’t know how Sarah was involved. To change the subject, Karen asked Jeremy what he was doing at the airport so early in the morning. He explained that he had flown to Chicago yesterday because he hadn’t wanted to wait until today to come home. He had been sitting at home for too long, wondering why Brad hadn’t called him with any news regarding his wife Shannon and son Jeremy. He said that when he finally decided to come home, Sarah had convinced him that it was better if he didn’t make the drive alone. Karen agreed with him that driving long distances by yourself could be boring, so she started walking with him towards the parking lot exit. After they left the airport, Jeremy asked Karen about the accident and if she had read any newspaper articles about it yet. Karen told him that she preferred to stay out of the media spotlight because she didn’t like talking about her husband’s affair. Jeremy apologized for asking her personal questions, but he was just trying to be a good friend. They talked about some other things until they got outside the airport, then Jeremy suddenly remembered that he had promised to give Karen a ride home. He assured her that it wasn’t a problem and offered to drive them both home since she was wearing so many layers of clothes. After driving for a while, they realized that they were quite hungry, so they stopped at a fast food restaurant for breakfast. Jeremy and Karen talked about their families as they ate their food. When their conversation took an awkward turn, Karen asked Jeremy to take a detour on the way home so she could get rid of the rest of her breakfast in a McDonald’s bathroom. When they were finished, Jeremy drove them both back to Sarah’s house.

	When he stepped into the house, Jeremy noticed Sarah and Brad sitting on the couch. It looked like they were having an argument about some personal issues. Brad was pacing around the room and gesturing while Sarah just sat there quietly listening to him. It seemed like Brad was angry with something Sarah had said, so Jeremy decided not to approach them until they were finished talking. He sat down on the couchand began reading a newspaper that was lying on the table in front of him. It took Brad and Sarah about ten minutes to calm down and finally start talking again. Jeremy could tell that both of them were still very upset, so he let them be. He had a feeling that it would be best to let them talk about things in private for as long as it took for them to calm down.

	After an hour or so, Brad and Sarah started talking about Shannon’s death again. Jeremy was surprised at how easily he could start crying again just by thinking about it. He had never cried over a death before, but he couldn’t get past the fact that his own mother had been driving when Shannon walked out into the road. He didn’t want to tell that to Karen and Sarah, though, so he just sat there quietly and listened to them talk about it. It was starting to become clear that this wasn’t the first time that Brad had cheated on Shannon with Sarah. She admitted that she’d been having an affair with him for almost six months now, but she had no idea why Brad would kill himself over her. She said that she didn’t have any feelings for him anymore and even though they’d had sex more than once since Shannon died, their relationship was purely physical. She hadn’t told Brad that she no longer loved him, either.

	When Brad and Sarah were finally done talking about the time leading up to Shannon’s death, Jeremy knew it was probably time to go home. He also knew that he didn’t want to hear about what happened after she killed herself ever again. It was too disturbing for him to hear about how her body had been mangled and then set on fire by the firefighters when they found her by the road.

	Brad and Sarah asked if he wanted to stay at their house for a few days, but he told them that he had to get back to Colorado so he could get some sleep, and because he felt guilty about lying to his mother about staying with them in the first place.

	After saying goodbye to Karen and Sarah, Jeremy got into his car and drove back to Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport.

	His mother was waiting for him at the airport in her own car. She had been there since she dropped Jeremy off at ‘The Field’ that morning, so she was glad to finally see her son again. When Jeremy",0

He drank every drop of it until the animal was finished. Then he rested and waited for nightfall.
	The moon rose high into the sky as night approached; it was a beautiful sight to see every time he saw it, but this night was more special than In a dark and grimy room, ten people huddled together on a dirty, old and worn-out mattress. The room was not much bigger than a prison cell. It was so small that it was hard to move around without bumping into the others.
	The ten people were dressed in rags and they all looked to be tired and hungry.  Their clothes were black or brown from the dirty marks that were all over them and their hair was dirt-covered and greasy.
	The people were all male, except for one woman. They were all middle-aged or older men. All of the men had tough and rugged faces that showed their years of hard work in the sun and wind. Most of their faces also showed cuts, scrapes, bruises, burns, cuts and scars from being beaten by other people.
	Two of the men had their right hands held tightly in a grip of iron from a wooden stick that was behind their backs.  These two men looked different than the others in the dirty room. They were clearly rich and important men before the apocalypse from what their clothes showed.
	Their clothes were expensive and well crafted. One of the men had on a full suit made out of black cloth with a darkbrown vest and a light gray tie. The other man had on a white coat that was torn at the shoulders, revealing his brown chest, which was covered in dirt and dirt-filled cuts.
	The ten people were huddled together in the small room to hide from the dangerous outside world. Their weapons were close by to protect them from any danger that would threaten their lives. The room was filled with several buckets that were used for collecting water leaks and one large barrel for storing water. The room also had several wooden crates that were used as beds. The group of survivors used the top of the barrels as a table where they ate and did their work from.
	The room was located deep underground in an old cave. The small door that they came in through was heavily guarded by iron bars and had a locked padlock on it to keep wild animals out.
	But worst of all, there was no sunlight in the room and it was dark and depressing.  There wasn’t even a single candle to give off some light for them to see by.
	The people didn’t know if they would ever be able to escape from the underground prison that they were trapped in.
	The world had changed but this group of survivors livedin harmony with nature. They depended on the forest to survive, and were completely oblivious to what was going on in the outside worl. They were happy and content with their lives, even though they didn’t have any idea what was happening in the outside world with all the chaos that was going on around them.
	It was a beautiful day outside and all the animals came out into the forest to enjoy it. The birds sang their merry song, bees buzzed around catching pollen from flowers, deer walked in the meadows eating flowers.  But this day of peace and joy was about to end as a man with red eyes showed up among the animals of nature. He grabbed a young fawn that was playing with its mother and ripped it open like a piece of paper. He swallowed its blood like it was a sweet delicacy to him.
	He went around looking for more food for himself, hunting every animal he could find that would get in his way. He ate their hearts, livers, kidneys and everything else that he could get his hands on. He killed young deer and ate their blood and entrails. He had no mercy for any creature that crossed his path; they were all in danger by the man with red eyes.The animals didn’t have a chance against him, they ran and squealed to their deaths; he killed them all without batting an eye. He was unstoppable. The end of the animals in the forest was near. The man with red eyes laughed as he watched each one of them die for him; he loved killing and torturing animals and this was his heaven on earth.
	However, there were some that had a chance of escaping him, but only if they acted quickly.
 	Once he was through with the forest, he marched into the woods. The leaves danced merrily as he walked across them; he didn’t disturb anything in his path because it was so perfect. Everything was exactly as it should be in this forest. He wanted to stay here forever and never have to leave it again, but he knew that wasn’t possible for him because a special day was coming soon.
 	He walked on until he reached a small cabin in the woods near a stream. It looked like a decent place to stay so he went inside and found what he needed for shelter from the elements, along with some food. He went outside and put up tarps to cover the windows of the cabin so no one couldsee him inside. Then he sat down beside the stream and ate his dinner. He noticed a deer in the distance; it was too far for him to shoot, but he didn’t need to worry about that because it was almost time.
	He looked at his watch and saw that a few minutes had passed since he had last checked; it was now time. He picked up his rifle and stood in front of the deer. It was staring at him with frightened eyes; he took aim and shot it in the head, killing it instantly. It fell onto its side as blood began to spill out. The man smiled as he watched the animal’s life leave its body; it was beautiful. Quickly, he went over and tore open the animal’s stomach with his bare hands. He scooped out its entrails and ate them before drinking its blood. The taste was fresh and sweet; he loved doing this because it gave him strength and power over other animals.

"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","Jenna Riley stood in the doorway of her family’s blue bungalow, sipping on a cold glass of milk. The air was warm and humid, and Jenna felt heavy in the muggy heat. She had worked the midnight shift at the diner all night long, and it was now four in the morning. Jenna was exhausted from working, and she wished that she could go home to her apartment soon. She passed a few other people on the sidewalk on her way home. They all wore clothes that were too warm for how humid it was outside that early in the morning. Jenna stopped to chat with one of her coworkers. Jenna wished that she worked during the day shift, like him. It would be easier on her body and easier for her to do errands during the day, rather than at night. She would have to wait until after ten thirty before she could go home and rest. She had time for a quick nap  before she had to leave for work again.

Jenna was carrying a big brown bag of books in one hand and her keys in the other as she walked down the street. She stopped to look at a flyer about a community event. As she was looking through the pages, someone grabbed her shoulder and spun her around behind her. The mugger pressed his hand over her mouth and pulled out a gun.

“Do anything stupid,” he warned, “and I’ll shoot you in the head and leave you in this alley, just like your friend.”

He was talking about the poor girl who had been found murdered in the alley behind the diner a few weeks ago. Jenna had often walked through that same alley on her way home from work. She wished that she hadn’t been too tired this morning to walk a different route.

Jenna tried to scream, but the mugger clamped his hand tighter over her mouth. When he let go of her shoulder, Jenna took advantage and ran for the doors of the library across the street. There were several people inside, working on their laptops or sitting in cozy chairs reading magazines.

“Help!” Jenna shouted, but the people either looked up from their work or kept reading. No one bothered to come out and help her.

The mugger ran up to her, grabbed at the bag of books she was holding, and screamed, “Give me your stupid books! Now!”

Jenna dropped the plastic-wrapped books, but the mugger tripped on his own feet, allowing Jenna to escape. As he stood up, he pulled out a gun and pointed it at Jenna.

Jenna knew that she couldn’t outrun him.

“Get over here or I’ll blow your brains out,” the mugger barked.

Jenna stepped closer to the man, giving him no other choice but to pull the trigger. When a shot rang out, Jenna instinctively ducked and found herself on the ground. It felt like her cheek was burning, but she couldn’t be sure.

The mugger laughed and knelt down next to her. “You made it easy for me, bitch,” he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette lighter. He looked down at Jenna  and smiled. “When I’m done with you, you won’t be able to walk home from your shift at the diner anymore.”

The mugger stood up and ignited the lighter. Jenna closed her eyes and felt a sharp pain in her face as the mugger pressed the hot end of the lighter against Jenna’s cheek. She heard a sizzle and when she opened her eyes, she saw the mugger staring at her.

Jenna sat up and coughed, blood spewing out of her mouth. She looked around and saw the mugger lighting another cigarette;  he was still sitting on the ground next to her. Jenna screamed as loud as she could and lunged forward at the mugger, knocking him off balance. The mugger fell backwards and screamed in pain as he fell onto some broken glass.

Jenna stood up, but was too weak to get very far. She stumbled to the other side of the alley and collapsed against a wall. She looked down at her hands and saw that they were covered in blood. Her shirt was also stained with blood, and she could feel it slowly seeping into her jeans.

The mugger got back to his feet and turned around; he was holding the lighter as if preparing for another attack. Jenna’s vision started to go dark, and she stumbled forward, trying to reach the diner. She reached her arms out as if to brace herself against the wall, but all she hit were cold bricks.

Jenna then felt a sharp sting in her side; she looked down and saw that she was bleeding profusely. She slowly sank to the ground, and began coughing up more blood. The mugger walked out of the alley after he saw that Jenna was lying motionless on the ground. He picked up his sunglasses from the ground and put them back on his face.

Jenna suddenly came to, and forced herself onto her knees. She heard sirens just outside the alley, and tried to crawl in the direction of the diner’s entrance. It was hard going, but she managed to make it to the door. She was about to use her hands to open it when she realized that her hand was completely covered in blood.

She then heard a voice, “It’s okay, just lean on me.” When she looked up, Damian Henchman was helping Jenna out behind the diner. Jenna coughed and spat out some blood onto the ground. She began coughing again, and then collapsed on the ground.

Jenna came to again, and this time, she found herself in a white-walled hospital room with a man in his mid twenties standing at her bedside. Jenna looked up at him, and noticed that he had long blond hair and blue eyes. His face was covered with deep, red scars. He wore a white shirt and pants that were tucked into black combat boots. He was holding Jenna’s hand, and stared back at her.",1
A group of survivors find themselves in a strange new world where they must band together to survive the perils that await them.,"most others. It would be the blood moon tonight, and that meant things would be different from now on. It meant that he would have the power to fulfill his life’s purpose and take over the world. He looked at his watch again and got up; it was time to go home.

	The man walked back into the woods, and after a few minutes of walking, he reached his cabin. He had built it himself when the world had been different; before everything went wrong. At first, he lived in a cave in the forest until he decided to build something better, stronger and permanent. It had been a big undertaking to build it all by himself, but he was proud of what he’d done. With one final kick of his foot against the dirt floor, he sat down and looked at where the deer had died.

	Suddenly, there was a bright light shining through the cabin’s window; instantly, everything became dark and quiet. The man looked around with his eyes wide open; he could hear people moving around in his cabin. His heart began to pound as he got up and tried to quietly walk over to the door in hopes of finding out who these intruders were. He reached the door and turned the handlequietly, trying not to make a sound that might alert them to his presence. The door opened easily, and when he looked inside, all he saw was a long hallway covered with darkness on either side.

	He took a few steps forward and nearly fell over when he felt someone grab hold of his arm tightly. He looked behind him, but he was alone. He looked ahead and saw a stairway that led up to a hallway; as he went up the stairs, more light seemed to come from inside of the cabin. He reached the top of the stairs, turned left and slowly walked down the hallway; he felt as though there were people all around him, watching him intently.

	He stopped for a moment because he could hear whispering coming from behind the door on his left. He looked through the small window in front of him at what was behind it, but it was too dark to see anything. He slowly walked closer to it and then quickly opened it quickly when he heard one of the strangers say, “He’s here!”

	He did not know what came over him, but he felt like he had to protect himself from them; maybe it was their size or their loud voices that disturbed him. He kicked oneof them in the head and then quickly ran away towards the stairway. As he turned around and looked down, he saw someone else come up behind him with a knife; he quickly threw something at the man’s face and then ran away down the stairs with the rest of the man’s friends chasing after him.

	As they all reached the bottom of the stairs, one of them shouted, “Hey you! Stop right there!” It was a woman, and she had a gun pointed at him. He turned around for just a second to see how many people were with her; there were three others behind her. The woman yelled again at him in a loud voice, “Stop right there, and drop your weapon!” The man stood there watching them carefully while holding onto the knife tightly. After he saw that they were all prepared for him, he decided to run away again.

	The man ran away as fast as he could down the hallway, but the woman with the gun was able to stay close behind him. “Don’t move!” she told him in a loud voice again, but he kept running away anyway. She began to chase after him, firing her gun at his sidewhenever she got close enough.

	After running for a few minutes, the man turned around and saw that he was starting to get further away from the people chasing after him. He knew they would never give up looking for him, so he needed to hide someplace until they gave up. He looked around nervously and tried to think where he could go. There was an office door down the hallway that had some papers stacked up against it; there was no one there, so he figured it might be a good place to hide. He walked over there slowly and tried to peek inside; the light was on in the room and he could see that there were some papers on the desk and in boxes on the floor. He slowly opened the door all the way so they couldn’t see him coming inside, and then crawled into the room quietly while holding onto his knife with both hands. The people outside were still yelling for him to stop, but he ignored them as much as he could. As he crawled into the room and began laying on his stomach, he could hear someone outside say that they should keep looking for him and not give up so easily; the man smiled and thought to himself that this might be the day that he finally got away from all of them.The only problem was that when the man raised himself up on his knees, he saw something on the floor in front of him that caught his eye; it was a pair of large metal claws attached to some kind of stick, and when he looked closer at them, he saw that they were attached to a large pair of steel-toed boots. From where he came into the room, the man had been crawling over what looked like a pile of dirty clothes, but now that he was on his knees he could see that they weren’t really clothes at all; they were pieces of dried meat dangling from the ceiling on some kind of weird meat hooks. The man was too shocked to move or yell out; he didn’t know what was going on, but it was obvious that he wasn’t where he wanted to be.

The man carefully stood up and backed away from the boots as far as he could, and as he did so, they began to move towards him. The man tried to move faster backwards but his foot got caught on a piece of clothing and he tripped, falling backwards onto the ground. Before the man could get up to run away again, he felt a burning pain in his calf and looked down;",0
The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,"while pointing over at Julia’s doorway with trembling hands.
	Thelma was shouting, “It’s coming for you, Julia! It’s coming for you!”

	Julia walked into Thelma Bates’ bedroom and sat down on the edge of her bed. It wasn’t like she could do anything to help her grandmother. If there was a monster in the house then there was probably nothing that Julia could do to stop it.
	But before she had time to think about what Thelma was saying, Julia saw something moving by her doorway. It looked like a shadow that seemed to be moving very quickly toward the hall closet and then disappeared into it. As soon as the shadow disappeared, Julia rushed out of the room and headed upstairs to her own bedroom.

	Julia made it up to her room without running into anything else odd, but she still wasn’t completely convinced that there was a monster living in the house with them. In fact, Julia knew that it could have been something else altogether. Julia thought about the first time that she had seen the dark figure standing by her doorway and how she thought that it might have been a shadow until it started moving toward her. But that was only an assumption; there had been no way for Julia to know for sure what she saw at the time. So there was a possibility that it wasn’t actually a monster at all.

	Julia went to her bed and fell asleep, hoping that she would be able to get some of the images out of her head.

	During the morning hours, Julia woke up several times but was still unable to go back to sleep because of the vivid images that kept running through her mind. But Julia was having more trouble with the visions than just being unable to get back to sleep. She was also starting to see things in other places as well.
	The last thing that Julia remembered seeing before she felt herself being pulled into another dream-like state was Joe Wheeler’s face.
	There wasn’t anything special about seeing Joe; he came over to the house often enough for Julia to know what he looked like. But somehow, even though she couldn’t remember what had happened during her vision, Julia knew that something bad was going to happen to Joe.

	Julia could hear Thelma yelling from downstairs, but the words didn’t make much sense to Julia. All of a suddenshe could feel herself being pulled away from the house and into a dark tunnel. Julia tried to resist, but the further she was pulled into her vision, the less control she had over her movements. She realized that it was no use; she would either have to let herself be pulled into whatever dream-like state she was in or allow herself to wake up.

	In the next instant, Julia found herself back in bed and covered by a thin sheet with no recollection of what had happened in between. The first thing that came to her mind when she opened her eyes was that she must have slept through the alarm and overslept for work. She quickly jumped out of bed and started to go into the bathroom. But Julia stopped when she noticed that there was someone standing there in front of the mirror. She knew it wasn’t Thelma Bates because Julia knew that her grandmother always got up at six o’clock every morning and got ready for the day before coming downstairs to eat breakfast.
	Julia turned around and noticed that it was Karen Jones who was standing there, staring at Julie with an expression on her face that Julie had never seen on Karen’s face before. Almost as soon as she saw Karen in the bathroom, Juliapushed past her and into the shower without another thought about what was going on or why it was happening to her.

	It wasn’t until after she had finished getting dressed and gone out to the kitchen that she realized what had happened. Julia remembered seeing Karen in the bathroom, but she also remembered her not being there anymore. At first, she thought that maybe she had imagined it. Maybe a small part of her mind tried to convince her that it couldn’t have happened because there was no possible explanation for what she saw. But Julia couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something very weird going on.
	The urge to ignore it won out, and Julia made her way down the stairs and into Thelma’s room. Her grandmother was still sleeping soundly in bed so Julia went into her own room and sat down at the dining table to have a quiet cup of coffee. As she took a sip of her drink, Julia heard what sounded like someone walking across the floor above her.

	Julia went down the staircase and into Thelma’s room again, just to be sure that she hadn’t imagined it. As soon as Julia entered the room, she noticed that something was wrong withThelma’s wheelchair. It wasn’t in its usual position, propped against the far wall near Thelma’s bed. Instead, it was sitting in the middle of the room and one of the wheels had been deliberately bent and destroyed.

	Julia didn’t hesitate; she immediately called Karen on her cell phone and asked if she had been to Thelma’s room earlier in the morning. Karen said no, but Julia knew that there was a big chance that she was lying about being somewhere else when the crime was committed. There were other people living in the house as well, so there was no reason for Julia to think that everyone who lived in her grandmother’s home on the hill could have been responsible for what happened in the basement.

	Julia hung up the phone and quickly returned to her room to retrieve her car keys. She wanted to go back home and look through some of her grandfather’s old books because she suspected that there might have been more information about what was happening to her in them than what she got from local doctors.

	As Julia walked down towards the car, she suddenly had a vision of herself walking through the forest and ending up in a dark while pointing over at Julia’s doorway with trembling hands.

As soon as the shadow disappeared, Julia rushed out of the room and headed upstairs to her own bedroom.

	Julia made it up to her room without running into anything else odd, but she still wasn’t completely convinced that there was a monster living in the house with them. In fact, Julia knew that it could have been something else altogether. Julia thought about the first time that she had seen the dark figure standing by her doorway and how she thought that it might have been a shadow until it started moving toward her. But that was only an assumption; there had been no way for Julia to know for sure what she saw at the time. So there was a possibility that it wasn’t actually a monster at all.

	Julia went to her bed and fell asleep, hoping that she would be able to get some of the images out of her head.

	During the morning hours, Julia woke up several times but was still unable to go back to sleep because of the vivid images that kept running through her mind. But Julia was having more trouble with the visions than just being unable to get back to sleep. She was also starting to see things in other places as well.
	The last thing that Julia remembered seeing before she felt herself being pulled into another dream-like state was Joe Wheeler’s face.
	There wasn’t anything special about seeing Joe; he came over to the house often enough for Julia to know what he looked like. But somehow, even though she couldn’t remember what had happened during her vision, Julia knew that something bad was going to happen to Joe.

	Julia could hear Thelma yelling from downstairs, but the words didn’t make much sense to Julia. All of a suddenshe could feel herself being pulled away from the house and into a dark tunnel. Julia tried to resist, but the further she was pulled into her vision, the less control she had over her movements. She realized that it was no use; she would either have to let herself be pulled into whatever dream-like state she was in or allow herself to wake up.

	In the next instant, Julia found herself back in bed and covered by a thin sheet with no recollection of what had happened in between. The first thing that came to her mind when she opened her eyes was that she must have slept through the alarm and overslept for work. She quickly jumped out of bed and started to go into the bathroom. But Julia stopped when she noticed that there was someone standing there in front of the mirror. She knew it wasn’t Thelma Bates because Julia knew that her grandmother always got up at six o’clock every morning and got ready for the day before coming downstairs to eat breakfast.
	Julia turned around and noticed that it was Karen Jones who was standing there, staring at Julie with an expression on her face that Julie had never seen on Karen’s face before. Almost as soon as she saw Karen in the bathroom, Juliapushed past her and into the shower without another thought about what was going on or why it was happening to her.

	It wasn’t until after she had finished getting dressed and gone out to the kitchen that she realized what had happened. Julia remembered seeing Karen in the bathroom, but she also remembered her not being there anymore. At first, she thought that maybe she had imagined it. Maybe a small part of her mind tried to convince her that it couldn’t have happened because there was no possible explanation for what she saw. But Julia couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something very weird going on.
	The urge to ignore it won out, and Julia made her way down the stairs and into Thelma’s room. Her grandmother was still sleeping soundly in bed so Julia went into her own room and sat down at the dining table to have a quiet cup of coffee. As she took a sip of her drink, Julia heard what sounded like someone walking across the floor above her.

	Julia went down the staircase and into Thelma’s room again, just to be sure that she hadn’t imagined it. As soon as Julia entered the room, she noticed that something was wrong withThelma’s wheelchair. It wasn’t in its usual position, propped against the far wall near Thelma’s bed. Instead, it was sitting in the middle of the room and one of the wheels had been deliberately bent and destroyed.

	Julia didn’t hesitate; she immediately called Karen on her cell phone and asked if she had been to Thelma’s room earlier in the morning. Karen said no, but Julia knew that there was a big chance that she was lying about being somewhere else when the crime was committed. There were other people living in the house as well, so there was no reason for Julia to think that everyone who lived in her grandmother’s home on the hill could have been responsible for what happened in the basement.

	Julia hung up the phone and quickly returned to her room to retrieve her car keys. She wanted to go back home and look through some of her grandfather’s old books because she suspected that there might have been more information about what was happening to her in them than what she got from local doctors.

	As Julia walked down towards the car, she suddenly had a vision of herself walking through the forest and ending up in a dark",0
"Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.","else where it is warm and has green fields?”

Jack shrugged his shoulders. “It’s just the first place that came to mind, Eliza. I don’t want to be here anymore. It reminds me of you too much, and I can’t stand the thought of that.”

Eliza moved closer to him again.

“It reminds you of me? You know, Jack, I may be dead, but I can still feel your touch on my skin. I can still feel our bodies pressing together and how strong you were when you made love to me.”

Jack moved closer to her again, as close as the grave would allow him, and looked into her eyes.

Jack stared at her for a long moment before saying anything to her. He could feel his heart beat faster as he looked into her beautiful blue eyes and listened to her soft voice.

“I moved to this place because of you, Eliza. I can’t be here anymore because it is where you died, and that is where I will always remember you. That is where everyone will remember you, and nothing could be more painful than that.”

Eliza moved her cheek to Jack’s hand while he was still speaking, and she moved her body so that they were pressed against each other.

“Moving to a new place won’t lessen the pain of losing me, Jack. It won’t make our memories fade away. Moving to a new place – anywhere – will only be a way for you to forget me.”

Jack moved his hand away from Eliza’s cheek and he placed it on the top of her gravestone. “Moving will be a way for me to get my life back,” he said as he moved his other hand to the gravestone on the other side of Eliza’s grave. “Moving is a way for us to be together again.”

Eliza could tell that Jack was getting upset with her and she moved her head away from his hand so that she could move to the other side of the gravestone. “It will never be like it used to be,” she said.

Jack moved closer to Eliza so that they were standing right next to each other once again. “Moving will make it better,” he said as  he reached out to hold her hand.

Eliza could feel the warmth coming from Jack’s body as his hand reached for hers and she pulled away from him before they touched. “I don’t want you to forget me, Jack,” she said. “I love you and I need you.”

Jack tried to talk to Eliza once again, but she didn’t say anything and he turned his head so that he could see her face as she looked at him coldly.

“You just need to get on with your life, Jack,” she said as she took a step away from him. “This is all I can do for you now.”

Jack tried to talk to her again but Eliza didn’t say anything and she disappeared before he could get a good look at her face. Jack tried to grasp for her hand but she was gone and he stared at the spot where she had stood, trying to understand what was going on.

Eliza’s ghost had been standing right next to Jack in the graveyard when she spoke to him, but there was no sign of her when he looked  around. He knew that she had gone somewhere because he could feel her presence, but he couldn’t see her any longer.

Jack walked around the gravestones and looked carefully amongst the grass as if Eliza would suddenly appear and tell him that none of this was real and that he had been dreaming all of it. He couldn’t find Eliza anywhere and she didn’t say anything as he searched, but she did nothing to stop him either.

It was clear to him that she couldn’t see him any more either. She looked like a ghost to everyone else, but her eyes were open and her ghostly appearance wasn’t accompanied by a translucent white glow like what he had seen in Halloween movies. She was just invisible to everyone except for Jack.

Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack walked around the graveyard, but he could tell that she was happy with how things had turned out. Eliza’s ghost had been one of the nicest ghosts that he ever knew, and it was wonderful to see her again. She deserved a happy ending and so did he. She didn’t say anything at all during their time in the graveyard. 

Jack watched her for a while longer and then he went over to his car. There was a lot that he wanted to do in the days ahead, but there was also a lot of unfinished business that had to be taken care of before that could happen. Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack got into his car, but she was looking at him again.

Jack wanted to tell her how much he appreciated what she had done for him after he had lost her. He wanted to thank her and ask her if there was any way that she could finish the job so that he wouldn’t have to let go. Jack wanted to tell her that she had done enough and that it was time for him to move on with the rest of his life. He wanted Eliza’s ghost to know that she didn’t have to be invisible any longer, and that she didn’t have to let go.

Jack said to her, “Eliza, please don’t leave me alone. Let go of me!”

Eliza said nothing at all.

Jack said to her, “Let go of me! Let me go! Let go! Please let me go!”

Jack tried to hold on to her, but she was gone.

Eliza’s ghost told him not to fight it and asked Jack to let go of what he was holding onto and then move on with his life. Jack asked her why, and Eliza told Jack that she wanted him to let go so that she could finally let go of him.

Jack’s ghost told Eliza that he didn’t want to move on. He didn’t want to let go of her. He didn’t want to live his  life without her. Eliza asked Jack what he would do if she stayed.

Jack said to her, “I want you to stay.” He wanted some sort of assurance that the ghost in front of him was really there, and so he asked her to repeat the question.  More quietly this time, she asked again if he wanted her to stay. When Eliza repeated the question a third time, Jack said that he did want her to stay, and so she told him that if he really wanted her to stay then she would.

Jack took a step toward the gravestone and then stopped. Eliza’s grave, Jack thought with the sudden realization of what he was doing. He was going to visit Eliza’s grave. He wasn’t visiting her body; he was visiting her grave. He was burying her all over again, this time without a body to bury. Jack took another step toward Eliza’s grave and started to weep. “Please don’t go,” he said choking on his words. “Please don’t leave me. Please stay with me. Don’t go away again. Please don’t go away .”

Eliza said that she wouldn’t leave him and that she would never go away again, but Jack was already moving toward the gravestone. He stopped when he got there and slowly walked around the gravestone looking for her whistle, which Eliza always wore around her neck. With each whistle he blew, Jack felt a hole opening up in his chest.

Jack found Eliza’s whistle under a rose bush that grew by the gravestone. He picked the rose petals off of it and blew the whistle several times, but when he stopped blowing, he felt empty again. 

Jack blew the whistle one last time and put it in his pocket. The whistle was cold in his hand, and it felt heavy with Eliza’s absence. Jack wiped the tears from his face, put on his coat and left the graveyard feeling as if all hope had been drained from him. He sat down on a park bench and looked up at the winter sky. Jack couldn’t stop thinking about Eliza, but he knew that she was right. It was time for him to let go of his past and move on with his life. But it didn’t mean that he had to like it.

Jack blew the whistle one more time, and then he put it in his pocket and left the park. He walked for a few blocks until he came to a small flower shop on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street and went inside. Jack bought mums, gardenias, geraniums, and roses and took them back to Eliza’s grave. He arranged the flowers around the base of the headstone and then sat down on the ground and leaned against it.

Jack stayed there until it started to get dark, and then he got up and brushed the dirt off of his hands. He looked at the headstone one last time and then turned and walked away.",1
"John Doe, the serial killer, tells Valerie that she must escape the basement before dawn or else she will become his next trophy.","well as the sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor. She was lying on her side and tried to curl up into a ball, but had nowhere to go. The footsteps stopped near her left side, and she heard something being placed on the ground. She closed her eyes tightly, trying to hold back a scream, and waited for John Doe to come back. The footsteps began moving again and moved towards the basement door. They became even louder and more frequent until they abruptly stopped, followed by the sound of a bolt sliding across a lock.

Then it got quiet. Very quiet. Valerie opened her eyes only to see that the light in the room was on, and she could see John Doe standing up at the top of the stairs, holding a very large hunting knife in his right hand. He told her to stay still and walked down the stairs slowly, making sure to drag his feet a bit so he would make noise. When he got about halfway down the stairs, he raised one arm and made a stabbing motion towards Valerie’s head with the knife. She screamed and tried to curl even tighter into a ball, but it was too late; she felt the sharp blade slice across her throat just barely missing her jugular vein. Blood poured out ofthe sliced wound as she lost consciousness, collapsing onto her side and sliding down to the cold concrete floor.

John Doe climbed down the rest of the stairs quickly and knelt beside Valerie’s head. His eyes were filled with a mixture of bloodlust and rage that frightened Valerie even more than his knife had. He dragged Valerie up off the ground and moved her onto her stomach, where he quickly duct taped her wrists together behind her back and then to a pipe near the corner of the room. Valerie again lost consciousness as John Doe left the room with no sign of returning.

 At long last, Valerie woke up again. She was still lying on her stomach on the concrete floor, but this time without being bound or gagged. She could tell that it was daylight outside because she could see through a small crack in one of the duct tape strips that covered her eyes. The space under her cheek still throbbed from the deep wound John Doe had inflicted, but it felt much better than it had last night.

Valerie slowly rolled over onto her back and lay there for a moment, trying to decide what to do. She knew it would be in her best interests to try and escape while John Doe was still gone, but she didn’tknow how far away he was or when he would be returning. Valerie decided that there was nothing for it: she had to take her chances and run for it.

Taking several deep breaths, she began to work on the duct tape that held her wrists together. It took some effort and persistence, but eventually she got it unwrapped enough so that she could slip her hands out of the strips without tearing them all off. With the tape mostly off, Valerie then moved onto trying to get out of the duct tape that had been wrapped around her mouth.

Valerie struggled with the strip of duct tape covering her mouth for a few minutes before finally tearing it loose from her face. As soon as she did, Valerie started screaming for help at the top of her lungs. The sound echoed around from every direction, bouncing off the walls and concrete floor and off neighboring buildings in all directions.  Valerie didn’t care if anyone heard or not—she would be damned if she was going to let John Doe kill her down here without putting up a fight.

While Valerie continued to scream for help, John slowly made his way back down into the basement from his room on the second floor. His eyes were wild and his face was twisted into a feralexpression of sheer rage. Valerie watched as he slowly made his way towards her, with the knife in one hand and a metal baseball bat in the other.

When he reached her, Valerie could tell by the look in John’s eyes that he was intent on killing her. And there was no possible way that she could fight him off—she was weak and injured after her recent brush with death at his hands only an hour earlier. With John just inches away from her, Valerie knew that there was nothing she could do to fight him off and survive this time around.

Out of desperation, Valerie kicked out as hard as she could with her right foot, hitting John square in the groin. He doubled over in pain and let go of the knife. Valerie quickly reached down and picked up the metal bat before John could recover enough to notice what she had done. She swung it hard with as much force as possible at the side of John’s head as he was recovering from her kick.

The sound of the bat hitting John’s skull was sickeningly loud, but at least it stunned him long enough for Valerie to make her getaway and escape to safety. As soon as she got out of the basement door, Valerie ranat full speed until she reached the highway. But as soon as she stepped out onto the road, John was there waiting for her, knife in hand.

He pulled her back into the basement where he proceeded to tie her up again and gag her with duct tape. Then he took Valerie over to a large wooden table and tied her arms and legs to it in a spreader bar fashion. He secured the table so that Valerie couldn’t move at all while he left the basement and went upstairs. As soon as he was gone, Valerie tried to loosen her restraints as quickly as possible.

Valerie heard a car pull into the driveway outside, one that sounded suspiciously like John’s car. She had no idea what time it was, but knew that she could not stay in the basement much longer or she would be killed by morning if John found her still alive. She needed to escape now before he returned to find her missing from the basement.

Valerie tried pulling against the restraints with every last ounce of strength she had, but it was no use. She needed to find a way out of here now before it was too late. When she looked around, Valerie noticed that there were various implements hanging by strings from the ceiling with",0
Julia finally learns the truth about the visions.,"comic book and read it.

	As Julia was reading the comic book, she started to feel really uneasy so she put it down and went out of her bedroom. She walked down the stairs as quietly as she could and then continued in a straight line towards Thelma’s bedroom because she knew that there was someone in there that might be able to help her cope with her hallucinations. She stopped at the front door and listened, trying to make out what was making all the noise. She tried listening for a moment with one ear before putting both ears back in place so that she could hear properly. Then she heard it: the sound of a chainsaw being turned on and off again, then a brief moment of silence before it started up again. Julia walked slowly towards Thelma’s bedroom door with her hands fidgeting with her hair. She took deep breaths to calm herself down but then she started stuttering again, so she stopped in the middle of the hallway and put both hands across her mouth so that she could try to stop herself from stuttering and crying out.

	As Julia was about three feet away from Thelma’s bedroom door, she paused again for a moment to listen but the chainsaw noises were suddenlystopped. Then she heard the sounds of a woman yelling “HELP ME!” over and over again.

Julia took a deep breath and tried to calm herself down, but as soon as she was close enough, she heard the sound of Thelma’s bedroom door being kicked open and a chain saw being turned on. Julia took another deep breath as she braced herself for what would happen next. She slowly opened the door and saw that no one was in the room except for Thelma. Her head was lying on its side on the floor by the bed and blood had begun to pool around her head. Thelma’s feet were sticking out from underneath the covers at one end of the bed, but there weren’t any feet on the other side of it.

	Julia became frightened and started to back away towards her bedroom door, but then she heard a loud thud coming from Thelma’s body as if someone had kicked it. Julia became even more frightened and ran back into her own bedroom.

	She shut her bedroom door tightly and took a deep breath again, trying to calm herself down as she listened to the sound of Thelma’s body beinghit again and again with a blunt object.

	At that point, Julia was so frightened that she didn’t think that she could take another second of it. She ran back out of her bedroom and down the stairs, out of the house, and into the woods before she felt safe enough to take another deep breath.

	It was dark outside, but Julia could make out the outlines of trees all around her. She didn’t know where to go, so she just started walking deeper and deeper into the woods. She kept going until her legs were too tired for her to walk any further. She sat down on a log nearby and leaned back against it, breathing heavily as she tried to regain control of herself. She closed her eyes and began to think about that night’s events as calmly as she could, but then all of the memories from the night before came back to her in a rush and she started crying uncontrollably.

	Julia continued crying until she calmed down enough so that she was able to take another deep breath and start thinking about what was happening with her. She came to the conclusion that it must be some sort of mental illness, but one that only affected her when she slept. She didn’t knowwhat to do about it, though. At least she had the thought that it only happened while she slept to comfort her. Then she fell asleep again, hoping that whatever was happening to her wouldn’t happen again tonight and hoping that if it did, that it wouldn’t cause her any physical harm.

	The next day, Julia woke up early and went to visit Thelma Bates at the hospital. She was so worried about Thelma that she forgot all about her own visions for a while. When Julia got to the hospital, though, she learned that Thelma had died during the night from a stroke caused by a heart attack.

	Julia was shocked and horrified to learn that Thelma had died so suddenly and unexpectedly. She felt guilty about it for a while, even though she knew that there was nothing that anyone could have done to save her. Julia went home after visiting the hospital and spent the rest of the day in bed, trying to keep her mind off of what had happened.

	Later that night while Julia was sleeping, something happened that made her question whether or not her visions were caused by some sort of mental illness or if they were something else entirely. While Julia slept, Mary walked into Thelma’s room. She grabbed a chainsaw and started running the saw over and over again until its motor quit working all together. Just as she went to turn it on for the sixth time, something caught her eye in the corner of the room. She looked up to see a thin dark shadow that seemed to be standing directly over Thelma’s bed. It stood there for a moment looking over Thelma’s unmoving body and then slowly disappeared into thin air.

	Mary’s vision only ended when she woke up screaming from her own bed a short while later. She got up out of bed, but decided that it would be better if she didn’t tell Julia what she had seen at the hospital that night.

	The next day, Julia decided that she wanted to speak with Karen Jones about what had happened at the hospital the night before. Karen was a teenager who lived in the same apartment complex as Julia and she was always friendly when she saw Julia out on one of her walks around town. She agreed to meet with Julia that evening, but only if it was in a public place; she didn’t want to get involved with any of the visions or hauntings that were taking place in town. comic book and read it.

"Kitty begins her investigation by speaking to the various dogs in the park, but none of them seem to be very helpful.","very far with the investigation because she only found one body. She spent most of the time playing with all the dogs instead.

    She liked Harry Houndstooth because he was so big and strong and yet he was also very gentle with her. He let her climb all over him and tickle his neck with her whiskers. She thought he smelled a little funny but she liked him anyway because he had such a kind face.

    She also had fun playing with Betty Beagle, who was very quick and clever, but sometimes she just wanted to have a nap even more than she wanted to play a game.

    Sergei Snipe was funny because he tried to run away from her but he could never do it properly because his legs were so short and fat. She liked the way his feet looked even though they were very weird because they were covered in thick fur instead of paws. She tried to chase him but he was too fast for her so she gave up trying to catch him.

    The other dog that Kitty liked a lot was Captain Kiddo because she liked the way that his ears flopped backwards and she thought his very shiny coat would make a great blanket. She liked to have a rest on his bigback but he wasn’t very cuddly so she didn’t stay there for as long as she wanted to.

    To Kitty, all the dogs had their own special qualities and she loved to spend time with them all because they were her friends. She didn’t like any one of them more than the others even though none of them were anything like her. She liked it when they all played together because they were all so different yet they got along well together.

	In between playing with the dogs, Kitty also tried to ask them if they had seen anything suspicious that day but none of them seemed to know anything about it. They all said that they hadn’t seen a thing so she decided that maybe she would have to go somewhere else for information.

	Once all the dogs had been walked and fed, Kitty got ready to leave because she had more investigating to do. She didn’t want any of the dogs accompanying her so Betty Beagle stayed behind with Harry Houndstooth and Sergei Snipe while Lulu Laverne went back with Captain Kiddo and Simon Bones was taken home by his owner.

	Kitty walked out of the gate with Kitty Pawsky still on her back, who was a good detective.Kitty Pawsky had very keen eyes and could pick up tiny details that most dogs couldn’t even see. They had been together for so long that they knew exactly what the other was thinking.

	Kitty and Kitty Pawsky began their walk to the park and then around it, checking every dog they saw until they were satisfied that nobody was hiding away as part of the investigation. They had been around twice when Kitty noticed something on a path she had never seen before. There were bits of paper spread all over the floor and it looked like someone had stepped in some cat food as well as other things like breadcrumbs. It looked like somebody had been looking for information or clues with the cat food but Kitty didn’t understand what had happened because it was such a small amount of it. Kitty knew that she would have to look deeper into things in order to get any more information out of these clues.

	When they walked passed the path with the mystery paper trail, Kitty bent down to see if she could spot anything that might give her any information but there wasn’t much there apart from some feathers and a few other small things like cigarette butts and other things that might have been dropped accidentally by the previous owner of the trail.

	Kitty felt sure that there must be something else she could find on her next walk because whoever left this trail had come back to look for it again.

	Kitty started walking around the trail in order to try and find some more bits of paper because there was obviously something important about them. She looked under every rock and behind every bush in case there were more pieces of the puzzle hidden away. Kitty’s plan worked though when she found a little piece of paper with paw prints on it near one of the trees. There was only one person who would have been walking their dog in this trail and that was Simon Bones, Harry Houndstooth’s owner. Kitty knew that he would talk to her about what had happened so she decided to speak to him next.

	Simon Bones wasn’t hard to find because he was one of the largest dogs in the park and everybody knew who he was. He would be easy to find because his owner had left a piece of paper which would lead her straight to him. When Kitty found Simon he was resting in one of his favorite spots. It was under a large tree where he liked to hide away from everybody else and think about all the problems he had. He was lying on hisback with his head resting on a big branch. His long white beard was spread out around him and his bright red eyes were closed.

	“Hello there Simon,” Kitty said when she found him, “I just wanted to have a quick chat with you because I am trying to solve a mystery and I don’t know what else to do.”

	Simon Bones looked up from the branch without opening his eyes and asked, “What is it that is causing so many problems?”

	Kitty went over to Simon and sat down beside him. She rubbed against him and said, “There’s been a series of dog-nappings in this park and Kitty Pawsky has been asked to help her friend solve them. Do you have any idea how we can make progress?”

	Simon Bones shook his head and replied, “I have not heard about any of the dog-nappings but it sounds as though they could be dangerous. I am sorry that I cannot help you with your investigation but I just wanted to tell you that.”

	Kitty gave Simon a friendly pat and thanked him for listening to her anyway before she left the park. She felt sure",1
"Shannon's second book becomes a success, making her a published author.","The only problem was that they didn’t have enough privacy. They spent too much time around each other and needed space. Shannon wanted to find another place, a place of her own, so that she could be alone when she needed to work on her second book. 

She found a small apartment on the third floor of a building near Samantha’s office. After she packed all of her belongings, she moved into her new place. If she needed anything, Sam was just a few minutes away and would come over with groceries or take her out for lunch.

After settling into her new place, Shannon called Samantha to tell her about her decision to move. “The apartment is comfortable and close to your office,” Shannon explained, “so I thought you might like it.”

“It sounds perfect. Are you ready to start working on your second book?”

“Yes,” she said, “and I already have a great editor. Her name is Rebecca Saunders. She used to work at Samhain, but now she works at HarperCollins and has agreed to edit my book.”

Sam was silent for a few seconds and then said, “She’s a great editor. She really knows what she’s doing. Her edits are brilliant and always precise.”

Shannon nodded in agreement and said, “I think this editing process is going to be much smoother than the last one.”

Sam agreed, “I’m sure it will be. You’re moving in the right direction, Shannon.”

Shannon smiled, “Are you coming over?”

“Definitely. I will come and move your things in.”

“Thank you, Sam, I really appreciate it. Bye.” She hung up the phone and ran to her computer desk. She opened her email account and typed the subject line for her email: Move In with Samantha. She typed a quick message into the email body and hit send.

She moved back to her desk and sat down. She started working on revising her manuscript, but then suddenly felt exhausted and decided to take a break for lunch. She closed her laptop and left her desk.

She moved into the living room and sat down on the couch. She was about to turn on the television when she heard her front door open. She walked into the hallway and saw Sam setting down her bags.

Sam turned around to face Shannon and said, “Moving your stuff in? ”

Shannon smiled, “I thought you might be moving in.”

“I am. Are you ready to go now?” Sam asked.

“Yes, I am. I have a lot of boxes to pack up, but I don’t want to take too much time. It’s going to be a long day.” Shannon grabbed the keys from the key hook by the entry door and held them out for Sam.

“Want me to carry anything?” Sam asked.

Shannon looked up at her, “No, I’m okay. Thank you though.”

Sam and Shannon walked out to their cars. They both got into their cars and buckled up for the drive to Rebecca Saunders’ offices. It took about forty minutes for them to move everything. Sam moved her clothes and books into the guest bedroom and Shannon moved her clothes into the master bedroom.

Rebecca’s office was located in an old Victorian-style mansion. It had been converted into a boutique publishing company. The old-fashioned mahogany woodwork, high ceilings and large windows made it feel more like a home than an office building.

When Sam and Shannon arrived Rebecca was in her office, talking to a tall woman with long straight brown hair. She wore a green dress with matching pumps and carried a yellow purse. She looked familiar to Shannon but she couldn’t place her.

Rebecca looked up and smiled at them, “Hey girls! I presume you are here about your book? Come on in!” She pointed toward the office door.

The three women entered Rebecca’s office and sat at the conference table across from each other. Rebecca had a pad of paper in front of her. The tall woman slid the yellow purse to the floor, turned to face them and extended her hand, “Hi, I am Susan. I am here to discuss the details of your book signing next week. Let me give you some background information on myself before we move onto business.”

Rebecca glanced at Shannon, “Susan and I go way back. We met in college. We decided to move to Seattle and start our own publishing company together instead of going out into the world and trying our luck in an already crowded job market.” 

Susan smiled, “Well it worked out for us! We now run one of the most successful publishing houses in the Pacific Northwest. Don’t you think so, Rebecca?”

Rebecca nodded, “Yes it did. So how was your trip to Los Angeles, Susan?”

Susan laughed, “It was … ummm … interesting. I went with Shannon to her agent’s offices and we signed a two-book deal with them. Shannon’s second book will debut in a few months. I think we should probably go with the old standby location for Shannon’s book signing. We have had great success there.”

Shannon looked at Susan, “I thought we were going to move the signing to Central Park?”

Susan smiled, “That is where we had it last year. That was before I knew that you moved to Los Angeles permanently. Shannon, the Seattle area really has no need for another book signing location. It is centrally located and easily accessible from all over the city. Plus if you sign there, it is easy to get to your house afterwards. You can always have a book signing at your house in Los Angeles too.”

Shannon shrugged, “Ok, I guess. Anyway the move to Los Angeles was prompted by my dad’s death. He left me his house here and my mom lives in Montana so I decided to move here.” Shannon paused, “Anyway, I am moving all of my things into her new house. She is renting it from a friend of hers. Her name is Rebecca Saunders and she owns the publishing company where I signed for my new book. We are moving her things into her new house today.” 

Susan looked at Shannon and smiled, “I love her! She has been so helpful to you. Is she like your editor or something?”

Shannon smiled, “Sort of. She is my agent for my books but also like a mentor to me too. I am excited to be moving in with her because it will be so much fun.”

“Yes, I read your book and it was very moving. Your agent is a smart woman because she helped you make that book so much better. You must have sent her a great manuscript because that was the best kind of self-help book. I want to thank you for agreeing to meet with me today. That is why I wanted to have this meeting in Central Park, because I wanted you to get a feel for our bookstore. The Barnes and Noble here is nice but it is not central enough and it does not have a great atmosphere. We moved our store to the West Village because when people travel to New York they want a bookstore that has a great community feel. We want people to come in and connect with each other. That is why we moved our store here and I think it was a great decision. We have an excellent selection of titles too, so it is a bookstore that everyone can enjoy.”

Shannon smiled, “How nice for you! It sounds like you have made your dreams come true.”

“Yes we did! So I hope you are going to move in with us because this will be a great fit. We move books out of the store here but don’t worry, yours won’t be one of them. This is a bookstore that allows for our authors to have readings and signing events. New Yorkers love reading so I think that would be very successful for us and good exposure for you. You can move a lot of books by coming to New York too!”

“Sounds great! That sounds like a good way to sell books, especially coming from someone with experience in New York.”

“Yes, I have experience in New York. And since it seems like your agent is moving to New York, we can make this happen very easily. There are also a lot of independent bookstores here too and we could do some smaller signings in those places as well. But most of them won’t be as good as this one. They will be much smaller and more intimate though so it would  be nice to do that as well.”

Shannon nodded, “What if I want to do a book tour?”

“Of course! We can do a full on national tour for you if you like. Book tours are always successful when it comes to selling books. It will probably not sell as many copies as we would have here but we can also go to other parts of the country which would be better for when your book is released in paperback. It won’t be out in paperback until next year though so I don’t think we need to do any sort of tour until then.” Shannon nodded, her mind already spinning with new ideas. “So tell me what you want to talk about with book stores and I will make calls to the stores and see what we can work out. Do you want one store in every state?” Shannon started to laugh a little, “Well no. I don’t expect my book to sell that many copies but maybe one or two in each state. Maybe a few more in the bigger states like California and Texas or something like that. But no more than three or four per store.”",1
Gabriel moves out of his parents' house and into his own apartment.,"The year was 2009, and Gabriel Martin had just turned twenty-two. He
had his whole life ahead of him, but he didn’t know what to do with it.
He was a man now, so he had to go out and get his own place. His mom was
proud of him and wanted to be proud of him when he moved out. She loved
him very much, and she knew that one day he would be the most handsome
man in the world. She said that God had big plans for him, and he
shouldn’t give up on them just yet. She knew Gabriel would be a star one
day, or at least do something special. He was a cool dude who had his own
style and knew what he wanted out of life. Gabriel was going to be a
father soon, but that didn’t scare him one bit. He was ready to be a man
and take care of his family.

   Gabriel had thought he would live with his friends forever, but now
that they have apartments, and friends are married, he needed to move out
and find a place of his own. It was a big step in his life, but he knewit was the right one. His friends helped him pick out a few places to look
at. They loved Gabriel so much, and knew that he could take care of himself.
They were all concerned about him living on his own, but they all trusted
that he could do it. They said that they would help him move into his new
apartment and even go grocery shopping for him. That made him feel so good
to know that he had such great friends.

   He looked at about three apartments before deciding which one to live
in. There were some nice ones and some not so nice ones, but he liked the
one he picked out the most. The place was large enough for him to live in,
and it wasn’t too expensive for him to pay rent on. He loved that there was
a park nearby where he could go sit and relax when he needed some alone
time. He loved the quietness of it, and he knew that when his mom came to
visit him she would love the place too. She wouldn’t have to worry about
him after he moved out because this place seemed so peaceful and safe.

   There weren’t any places available that dayto move into, but
he was determined to get into one of the apartments. So, his friends helped
him move in by carrying his stuff up all those steps. The place was empty
so they didn’t have to worry about moving things over and finding a place
for them. Then they went grocery shopping for him so that he would have a
few things to eat for a couple of days until he got paid. They were so nice
to him, and he knew that they would always be there for him no matter what.

   He sat down on his couch and took in all the sights and sounds of his
new place. He loved it! The only thing missing was his mom who had come to
see him earlier that day and helped set up the apartment a little bit. She
had brought over some food from his grandma’s house for him to eat while he
set up everything else. His grandma had gone with her to help him move all
of his stuff in, and then took her back home. Gabriel really missed them,
and he couldn’t wait to tell them how much he loved his new place.

   It was late at night when he saw the note on his door. He smiled as he held
up the note as if it were some kind of trophy. He had told his friends not
to bring any girls over while he was setting up. He wanted to have no
distractions while unpacking and arranging everything. He didn’t want to be
asked any questions about this or that, or why did they move something
where it didn’t seem right. He knew what he had done to make his new home
a nice and comfortable place for him.

   So, he walked outside and read the note left by Jeremy for him. It just
said “congratulations buddy!”

   Gabriel ran back inside and grabbed his phone. He called Jeremy who was
already in bed with a girl so it went straight to voicemail. He called
Angelica who also had already gone out when she got off work but she was
too tired and fell asleep right after talking to him so her phone went
straight to voicemail too.He called Richie who was at the club still and
was planning to stay there so he didn’t pick up. He called Julio but his
phone went just as straight to voicemail as the rest of them did.

   The next day, Gabriel felt lonely and didn’t know what to do with
himself. Julio was out on a delivery trip until that evening so no matter
how many times Gabriel tried calling him, he knew it was useless. He would
have to wait until tonight to hear from his father and that made him sad.

   Gabriel was going through his closet trying to think of what he could do
with himself when the doorbell rang. He opened the door expecting one of his
friends but he found Julio standing outside in a suit carrying a couple of
bags full of food in his hands. Julio was covered with dirt and gasoline.

   “Good morning Gabriel,” he said as he put the bags on Gabriel’s couch.
He walked over to the kitchen and grabbed a paper towel that was hanging on
the wall next to the sink to wipe his hands. He looked at Gabriel’s empty
fridge and said “Let’s go",0
Anna Cooper must find a way to stop the darkness from taking over the school and protect the innocent students.,"teacher asks Lily if she has ever had sexual feelings towards another woman, but Lily refuses to answer any of her questions.

- After school, Laura tells Maryanne that she and the other girls now call Anna “the witch” because of her attitude. The two girls agree that they should do something about this problem themselves since no one else will help them. Maryanne suggests that they ask Anna if she can talk to their parents about it; however, Laura refuses to do so because she knows that it will only make things worse for them.

- That night, Anna asks Daniel if he has heard any more stories about Lily’s classmates threatening Maryanne. He confirms this and adds that they have not been acting like normal children either. Daniel is sure that whatever is going on in the town will affect their children as well, so he is very concerned about keeping them safe.

- After Anna has gone to bed, Daniel sits up in bed and thinks about what has been happening at the school. He remembers how his third-grade teacher walked into her classroom with a black eye and broken arm one day after being attacked by a group of boys. He also remembers how she refused to talk about what happened and left right after school was dismissed. This event had a profound effect on him as a child and is still affecting him now, so he decides that he must do something about the situation at the school so that it will not affect his family.

- The next morning, Anna arrives at the school earlier than usual. She goes into the building and heads straight to the principal’s office. As she approaches his door, she sees that it is closed, but she decides to knock anyway just in case he is awake. She knocks once on the door, but there is no answer. She knocks again, but there is still no answer; she begins to wonder whether or not she woke him up. She decides to put her ear up against the door in hopes of hearing some noise coming from inside; however, there is only silence. Anna turns around and leaves the office because she is not trying to disturb him at this early hour. She goes back outside and heads for the school’s main office. As she walks down the hall, she stops by a classroom door that is open; it belongs to Miss Miller’s class. Anna looks inside and sees that all the lights are off, so she decides to go in and check on her.She takes a quick peek inside the room and notices that everything is quiet and still, so she walks in to investigate. She looks around the room for a moment but does not find anyone there; the room is completely vacant, like no one has been there at all. Anna is confused by this and wonders where everyone could have gone. She decides to stand in the doorway for a moment to see if anyone will come out of class soon. Just as she is thinking this, she hears noises coming from behind her. She turns around and finds that Lily Washington has emerged from the classroom door and is walking toward her. Lily waves at Anna and smiles; Anna returns the gesture but keeps her eyes peeled because she does not trust her. Lily asks Anna what she is doing standing there, but Anna ignores Lily’s question and tells her to return to class. Anna reaches out and grabs Lily’s arm, but instead of pulling on it, she pushes it away from her body. She tells Lily to go home because there is no school today. Lily frowns and begins to argue with Anna about this, so Anna drags her toward the doorway and pushes her out into the hallway. As they are walking down the hall together, Lily asks Anna why she thinks that thereis no school today. Anna explains to her that it is Friday and everyone should be at home doing their work. Anna looks over at the clock in the hallway while she is talking; it says 8:59 a.m., and Miss Miller’s class starts at 8:50 a.m., so class must be over by now. They walk outside and Lily begins to run away from Anna, but Anna runs after her until she stops her from attempting to leave the building. She reminds Lily that it is not safe for her to be outside right now because of all the bad things that have been happening at the school and tells her that she should forget about school and just start to work on her homework.

Lily says nothing in response; instead she whines like a little girl who wants something but does not have the money to buy it. Anna explains that working on homework means doing well in school; however, Lily tells her that people who do well in school are not nice people. Anna’s eyes widen at these words and her mouth opens slightly before closing. She tries to explain to Lily that most of the students at the school are very nice; in fact, she thinks that Lily is a very nice girl herself. But before Anna canget any more words out, Lily runs off and runs around the building trying to catch up with her friends from school. Anna has no choice but to watch her flee from the doors of the building and jump into a waiting car that is ready to drive away.

Anna waits for about ten minutes then walks back inside. She hears a crash come from behind the door just as she is about to enter, so she hurries away from it. It must be from one of the boys, she thinks to herself because Maryanne would not have done such a thing. When she gets back inside, she walks down the hallway and looks for Daniel Cooper, but he says nothing when he sees her so Anna walks back down the hall and heads toward Miss Miller’s classroom. She finds all of the chairs pushed in and the room empty, so she follows her instinct and takes a look inside Maryanne’s second grade classroom. It is empty as well so Anna moves on to Miss Miller’s first grade classroom. She finds that it is also empty, but she notices a pile of books on the floor beneath Miss Miller’s desk. She bends down to pick up one of the books in an attempt to read it, but when she does, she feels a sharp pain in her back and everything goes black.",0

"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.","“Hello? Liam?” She said as she waved at him.
	He looked over at Jenna with an annoyed expression on his face. “What do you want?” He asked sarcastically.
	The sarcasm irritated her slightly, but she didn’t show it. “I just wanted to say thank you for saving me when I was being attacked a few weeks ago. I couldn’t have done it without your help.”
	Liam looked taken aback by the compliment and paused for a few seconds before answering. “Don’t mention it, I don’t know what came over me when I saw that you were in trouble, but I just had to help you. It might have been a bad decision on my part since now I am being hunted by some guy because of it.”
	Jenna frowned when she heard this and looked down in shame. “I am sorry Liam, I didn’t think that it would come to this. I will do anything that I can to help you get rid of your attacker... please don’t kill me!”
	Liam laughed a little at the request that Jenna made and said,“I don’t think that I would ever want to kill you Jenna. You are much too pretty, but if your attacker gets past me I can’t guarantee that my next move is going to be as kind.”
	Jenna smiled brightly at him and said, “I will do whatever it takes to stay out of trouble. I don’t want anyone else getting hurt because of my actions.”
	Liam looked at her and smiled back, “I know you will Jenna. You are a good girl and your attacker is lucky to have you as an enemy.”
	Jenna blushed when she heard this compliment and then grew concerned again when she saw that two men were approaching Liam. “You should go now Liam, this is not your problem, I will be fine!”
	Liam shook his head, “I don’t think so Jenna. Besides these guys look harmless enough, but I will let you see them from a safe distance before you make up your mind about them.”
	The two men stopped when they saw Liam standing in front of the two of them and said in unison, “Good evening Mr. Cross;are you enjoying your night?”
	Liam laughed at their corny line and replied, “Yeah I am having a great time. How about you guys, did you come here to have fun tonight?”
	The two men smiled at each other and replied simultaneously, “No, we came to protect you Mr. Cross!”
	Jenna frowned at this response and said in disgust, “You mean you came here to keep me safe from danger?”
	The two men nodded their heads at her with a smile and continued to follow Liam closely as he walked away.
	Jenna followed them closely until they went through a black curtain into what appeared to be another room inside of the castle. When she saw that Liam was still unharmed she breathed a sigh of relief and continued to walk towards the entrance where there wasn’t any sign of her attacker. This made Jenna wonder if they had just been sent by Gregory to be there as a precautionary measure or if they were there because someone was threatening him. Either way Jenna didn’t want to cause any trouble for Gregory, so she quickly walked past his table to head towards the dance floor where there were many people having fun anddancing.
	Music played loudly and the crowd danced wildly to every beat. Jenna took off her coat and put it on the nearest chair so that she could dance freely while still being able to keep an eye on her surroundings at all times. After seeing that none of the people around her were a threat she began to have some fun herself and started dancing with some of the men who asked, but none of them could match up to Liam’s dancing style. He was her hero and savior after all so he deserved a special treat in honor of his name day.
	For the next hour Jenna enjoyed herself by dancing and mingling with some of the other guests while keeping an eye on Liam who remained stationary at his seat with a smile on his face watching her. She saw that he winked at her once in a while and continued to drink from his glass every time it got low without getting up. She knew that he was waiting for her to make some kind of move on him even though she was supposed to be the shy and helpless girl because that’s what he wanted to feel powerful.
	When one of the girls who had asked her for a dance had gotten drunk, Jenna decided that it was time to leave before she ended up being accusedof something that she would never do. She started to make her way through the crowd but Liam stood up before she could reach him and walked toward her.
	“What are you doing here?” Jenna asked while pulling away from the man who had been dancing with her.
	“I thought I told you that I would come and visit you. It wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t at least say happy name day, right?”
	“Happy name day? Is it your birthday or something? I can’t believe I wasted all this time on you when I should have been at home by now,” she said while turning towards the entrance of the club.
	Liam grabbed her arm and held on to it tightly before walking with her through the crowd and out of the club. He stopped only to open the door for her and then they were outside in the parking lot, standing in front of his car.
	“What are you doing? You just told me that it was your name day not even five minutes ago!”
	He ignored her and stood in front of her blocking all of her attempts to move past him. “I am not leaving until you come with me,” he said in a serious voice.",0
"Shannon meets Luke, a young man who helps her with her second book.","“All right,” said Shannon, taking a sip from her glass of wine. “I’m done.”

She put the first draft of her book on the floor next to her nightstand and took out a piece of paper. She wrote a note to Abby and left it by the computer.

Shannon’s hand shook as she wrote Luke’s phone number on the paper. She set it on the desk next to her computer and picked up her glass of wine. Shannon decided to drink it all, even though she didn’t feel like it, to wash away the taste of failure. With a sigh, she put the glass to her lips. The heat from the wine burned her mouth and throat as it traveled down into her stomach.

“I should have gone dancing with Abby tonight,” she thought. “I should have gotten drunk and made out with some hot guy. That would have been more fun than sitting here, staring at a blank screen.”

It was a warm June evening out in Central Park. Shannon stood on the concrete path that led to the boathouse and leaned against the railing overlooking the water. She closed her eyes and moved her face closer to the sun.

Shannon opened her eyes. Below in the park, a couple passed by holding hands, moving slowly under the shade of trees. They were moving towards the boathouse where she stood leaning on the railing, just like she was doing now.

“Maybe I should move?” Shannon thought. “It will be less awkward if I move.”

She started to move but hesitated for a moment and stopped again. Then she decided that it wouldn’t be a big deal if she stayed there, so she continued leaning against the railing.

The couple moved closer to the boathouse and stopped in front of Shannon.

“Can we take a look at the view over here?” The man said.

“Sure,” Shannon replied. “Be careful though; it gets really slippery out here.”

The couple moved past Shannon and stood close to each other in front of the railing. Then they moved closer to each other and started hugging each other tightly.

“They are moving in for a kiss,” Shannon thought with a smile on her face. “Maybe  now I shouldn’t move after all. It would be nice to watch them kiss.”

She took a sip from the wine glass and heard footsteps coming towards her. She turned around to see Luke walking towards her.

“Hi, I’m Luke,” He said and smiled at her.

“I’m Shannon,” She replied and smiled back.

They shook hands briefly, but Luke soon realized that he should have offered his hand for longer than he did. So they shook hands again, this time for longer. Then they stopped at the coffee shop on the lakeside to have a cup of coffee.

“So, you moved out of your apartment. I hope you are doing ok?” Luke said as they sat down at a table.

“Yeah, I think it will be better to live somewhere else for a while now,” Shannon answered and moved her eyes to a group of three people who were passing them by.

There was a tall, dark-haired woman in the lead. She had moved to another table nearby, where two men were sitting. One was reading a newspaper and the other was drinking coffee from a cup with foam on top. The three of them looked happy together, as if they were enjoying the fact that everything was moving smoothly for them in that moment.

“Have a nice coffee,” The barista said loudly as he walked by. “Have a nice date…”

Shannon moved her eyes to the tall, dark-haired woman again. Shannon turned to Luke and said: “Maybe moving somewhere else will help me clear my head. Maybe I could go somewhere in Europe or Asia. Just move out of my apartment and away from here. Just to have some space for a change.”

“Moving to Europe? Asia? That sounds like a great idea. You should do it,” Luke answered with a wide smile on his face. “When do you want to go?”

“I don’t know yet, but I am moving out of my apartment,” she said.

“I will come over one of these days and help you move your stuff out of your apartment,” Luke said earnestly. “Where are you going to move to? Somewhere closer to work? Closer to school? Or somewhere  completely different?”

Shannon smiled back at him and took a sip of her latte. “I’ll tell you everything when I know myself, but I have to end this relationship first,” Shannon said.

The smile on Luke’s face faded and he asked Shannon, “What happened? Why is it over? What is going on? Things were going quite well for a while.”

Shannon took another sip of her latte. “Things were good for a bit, but I just can’t do this anymore. It was going so well… I started liking him and now I’m moving out of my apartment and thinking about moving to Europe or Asia. Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? What am I going to do there? What will I tell my parents? Or my agent for that matter? Or my best friend, who keeps telling me to move on?” Shannon paused and looked up at the ceiling. “This is just a stupid mistake. I’ve got to end it now before it gets worse—before I make an even bigger fool out of myself,” she said softly. “But I can’t move out tonight.”

Luke put his hand on Shannon’s and said, “Why not move in with me? You don’t have to decide anything tonight. Just give it some thought. Think about what you want to do and decide tomorrow. Why not move in with me for a few days and move your stuff into my place?”

Shannon gave the same reasons she gave her best friend for not moving in with Luke. Shannon was hesitant to let Luke know how serious she had gotten about him, but she knew that if she didn’t move in with him now it would be even more difficult to move on later.

In the apartment, Shannon decided that she wanted to move in with Luke, and so did he. That settled, they went off for pizza and beer and spent the rest of the evening discussing their lives. Shannon told Luke about her childhood, about living with her mother and moving around, about her father dying, and about the failed book.

The next day Shannon moved all of her stuff into Luke’s apartment. She put most of it in his bedroom, where his bed was already set up. She didn’t put his bed together. Instead, she  kept it separate, on some sheets in the middle of the room. She put a few books on his desk, and a few other things in the kitchen.

After Shannon moved her stuff into Luke’s apartment, they spent a lot of time together. Shannon spent long hours at Luke’s apartment, and they often went out together. Shannon’s second book started to take shape with Luke’s help. But the relationship between Shannon and Luke was also beginning to take shape.

Over the next few weeks, they grew closer. Their conversations became more revealing and intimate. The topics shifted from Shannon’s work to her personal life, and Luke told her about growing up in a small town, about his childhood friends and schoolmates. Luke confided in Shannon about his mother and his failed engagement.

The conversations helped both of them move forward with their lives, with Luke helping Shannon with her second book  and Shannon helping Luke to overcome his struggles with women. It was a turning point for both of them, and they were falling in love.

Shannon spent more time at Luke’s apartment than she did at her own place. She was also starting to care for him, and she wanted to spend more time with him.

But this love affair didn’t last long. While Shannon and Luke were falling in love, publishers were already showing interest in Shannon’s second manuscript. She had been a bit distracted while working on her first book, and the result was disappointing. But her second book was different. There wasn’t anything holding her back from getting published.

Publishers were still interested in Shannon’s first book, however. She was invited to meetings with editors at different publishing houses and asked to give them updates on how her second book was coming along. She promised them that she would be moving forward with the publication of her second book next month.

Publishers eventually offered Shannon a deal with one of their publishing houses, and she signed the contract right away.

Shannon moved in with Luke almost immediately after she started working on her second book, because it was close to her new office.",0
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"The next morning Anna Cooper wakes up early to start her new job as a school janitor. She has been hired for the position because she is fast and efficient with her cleaning duties, and she is always willing to go above and beyond what is expected of her. She arrives at the school before the other students arrive, so she has time to clean the classrooms before they arrive.

   Anna is excited about her new job and plans to do it well so that she can be considered for more jobs in the future. As she cleans a classroom, her niece Maryanne arrives at the school. Maryanne is an excellent student who has always done well in school, and everyone expects great things from her in the future.

   When Maryanne sees her aunt sweeping up, she asks if she can help out and get some experience by helping her during her work day. Anna is glad to have help at this point because Maryanne is not an experienced cleaner. The two of them sweep up the classroom until it is time for the other students to arrive. Once they have cleaned all the rooms, they leave for a late lunch.

   When they come back to the school after lunch, they see that everything looks good and ready for the students. Annathen reminds Maryanne that she has to go home before curfew. She tells Maryanne that she cannot watch her work, but Maryanne says that she would be willing to stay.

   As the day progresses, Anna works hard and cleans all the classrooms efficiently. One of the teachers, Miss Miller, notices and compliments her work ethic. When Anna says that she likes her job because it is easy work and she wants to get more cleaning jobs in the future, Miss Miller asks if she would like a job as a teacher when she graduates from high school. Anna declines, saying that teaching is not for her. Miss Miller acknowledges this and suggests that Anna might want to consider being a counselor instead, since she seems to be good with children.

   The next day at work is similar to the first - fast-paced cleaning, quick lunch and back to work before the students arrive. The only major difference is that Anna notices that some of the students are getting a bit too friendly with their teachers. She does not say anything because she does not want to gossip or cause trouble, but she is bothered by what she sees, so she goes home early and does not tell her husband about it.

   On Saturday morning, Anna wakes up early to go backto her cleaning job. She has a new list of things to do, including cleaning the hallways. As she cleans, several of the students walk out of their classes and pass by her, making fun of her appearance and laughing at her clothes. She is used to this kind of treatment from some of the students and does not react too much to it, but a few minutes later when Anna hears Maryanne say that she is going to visit a friend, she feels scared and alone. She wonders how long Maryanne has been talking about this friend and if anyone will notice or care if something happens to Anna while she is alone. Anna decides that it would be best for Maryanne to stay with her, so she asks Maryanne if she wants to help her clean the hallways and put the chairs away in the auditorium. Maryanne happily agrees and they spend the rest of the day together.

   When Anna shows up for work on Monday morning, Miss Miller informs her that she is no longer needed at the school. She offers Anna a letter of recommendation if the young woman needs one; however, this means that Maryanne will have nothing to do during her lunch hour, so Miss Miller suggests that Maryanne stay with her. Once again, Anna reluctantly agreesto let Maryanne stay with her during her lunch hour. All morning, the two women work in silence. They do not speak to each other and they avoid eye contact. At the end of the day, Anna is given a letter of recommendation by Miss Miller and she tells the principal that she will not be returning to work at the school.

   After being fired from her job, Anna decides that she needs to figure out why Maryanne is so interested in seeing her aunt every day. So, the next day during lunchtime, she goes over to Maryanne where she finds Maryanne smiling and laughing in a car with another student named Tommy Washington. The two students tell Anna that they are going to meet at Maryanne’s aunt’s house and then they drive off. Anna thinks back to the previous day when she had noticed a man talking with Maryanne’s aunt. She wonders if her suspicions are true—that Maryanne is being molested by her teacher—but she does not know what to do or how to go about telling the police about it.

   That night, while Anna is cleaning the restroom at the school, Daniel Cooper comes into the room and tells her that he has an important meeting in the morning thatrequires him to do some research for work. Anna asks if she should come with him, but he says no and leaves the room. When Daniel returns home that night, he finds Anna waiting for him. He can tell from her expression that something is wrong and she tells him about Maryanne’s strange behavior. Daniel is shocked by what Anna has told him, but he does not want to get involved with the matter because Maryanne is Lily’s little sister and he feels like it would be inappropriate to get involved in this situation. So, they go to bed without deciding what they should do about Maryanne’s situation, but Anna still feels a great sense of guilt and anxiety about what she should do.

   The next day at school, people have been gossiping about what happened with Anna and Miss Miller. Some people think that Anna deserves to be fired for trying to cause trouble. Others think that it may not be a good idea to fire Anna because she might end up telling some of the teachers about the secrets they have been keeping at the school. As a result of her work as a janitor, Anna knows some terrible things about the people that work in the school. She is aware of how many of them are doing drugs and",1
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,"side door. She stood behind the reception desk for several seconds, listening closely, trying to determine whether she could hear anyone inside. There was the murmur of voices in the background and maybe even some faint music, but she couldn’t make out any actual words.

	With that information, she slowly made her way to the back of the desk where there was a small supply closet and waited there in complete silence for several minutes. She didn’t really care that she had snuck into her own building through an unlocked door or that she was hiding in a supply closet – it seemed appropriate in some way – but she did want to make sure she wasn’t being followed. She made no noise except for the soft padding of her feet on the carpet flooring, trying to keep them quiet enough that they couldn’t be heard from within the room.

	After what seemed like an eternity, and was probably only a few minutes, she saw someone come out of the bathroom and into view near the reception desk. It was Kyle. He smiled at her when he saw her and motioned for her to come out of the closet and follow him.

	She stood up from behind the desk and walked towards him. She took a deepbreath as she tried to steady her nerves, but as soon as she passed the threshold of the closet, her anxiety shot through the roof. The voices in the other room were talking and laughing loudly, music was playing loudly as well, and there were several people crowded near the counter; one of them even had their arm around Kyle’s waist.

	The only thing that kept her from running out of there was the look on Kyle’s face – he looked so happy to see her. The thought of disappointing him, or hurting his feelings, held her in place as she walked towards him; it also helped that he was blocking everyone else from the closet so they couldn’t see her.

	“Hey!” he said excitedly as she came around the corner, and pulled her in for a big hug. She returned his embrace with one of her own, happy to see him as well, even if this wasn’t how she wanted to see him. He kissed her cheek and put his arm around her, letting it linger there for a moment before letting go again. His attention was already on someone else, on a woman who was standing not too far from them; it seemed like she was trying to get his attention, and Kyle was happy to oblige.

	“Hi,” he said as they separated. “This is Aimee.”

	Aimee smiled as she shook Kyle’s hand, and then looked up to smile at him as well. He had a boyish charm about him that she couldn’t help but find endearing, but he didn’t seem the least bit interested in her. She felt a pang of hurt inside at the thought of being rejected so easily, but Kyle was already saying something else to her that caught her attention.

	“I wanted you to meet someone. This is Patricia; we work together at the hospital. This is Aimee.”

	Kyle did not go into any further explanation about Patricia or what she does at the hospital, and although Aimee felt hurt she decided not to push the issue; there were other things that were much more pressing at the moment.

	“Have you come here to join us?” Patricia asked Aimee, moving close enough for them to touch and smiling warmly at her.

	Aimee smiled back, feeling comfortable in Patricia’s company. “Kyleinvited me over because I haven’t been going to the club since my divorce. He told me I should come hang out with people who understand me.”

	Patricia put her arm around Aimee and squeezed her gently.

	“We do understand you, don’t we?” Patricia said gently, and her eyes locked on Aimee’s for a moment before turning back to Kyle. “You told me about her at the club. I thought it was very noble of you to offer her a home away from home... or a place to belong or whatever it was you said.”

	Aimee could feel herself blushing at the praise, and she looked over toward Kyle. He seemed to be in a world of his own as he smiled at Patricia while listening to Aimee talk about herself.

	“Thank you,” she said to Kyle after a moment, smiling shyly at him. “I think your club really is a good idea for me. I think I can offer some of the younger people there something they might not have experienced yet and that could be very beneficial for their growth as young adults.”“My pleasure,” Kyle said as he looked up from the television and shifted his attention toward Aimee. “I think you’ll be a great help to us with the youth group here. The kids are dying for someone their own age to talk to, and I think you can fill that void.”

	Aimee nodded enthusiastically. “I never had anyone my age to talk to when I was growing up,” she said, “and it definitely stunted my development socially... but I think talking to them is the least I can do... and what better way than by sharing my experiences with them?”

	Aimee felt like she was rambling because she had run out of things to say, but Kyle just smiled at her and raised his glass in a toast. Patricia followed suit, but it seemed to Aimee that there was more meaning in her gesture than Kyle’s.

	“Here’s to helping the kids,” Kyle said with a smile, and both Aimee and Patricia responded by raising their glasses as well.

	“Speaking of which,” Aimee said once she had set her glass down",0
"Valerie Marx wakes up in a dark basement, bound and gagged.","Valerie woke up in a cramped space, bound at the wrists and ankles.
    She was on her back, but couldn’t see anything with her eyes blinded by duct tape.
    Her face was covered by a rag that smelled of gasoline and other chemicals.
    A damp, musty smell permeated the air around her.
    The floor was concrete and very cold to the touch.

She could make out a shape in front of her that reminded her of a coffin, but with the top cut off.

   She was shivering when she heard someone breathing heavily next to her.
   The sound made Valerie’s muscles tighten and she felt like she would scream at any moment.
   Her heart started pumping faster as her brain tried to make sense of what was happening.
   Whoever this person was, they had her tied up and possibly drugged, but they hadn’t killed her.
   Yet.

   She heard the sound of air being forced through clenched teeth and knew that the person next to her was in as much pain as she was.
   The person moved around and Valerie felt something sharp pokeher in the neck, but it wasn’t enough to break skin.
   Then she heard a voice, muffled by the duct tape, say “Be quiet or I’ll cut you.”
   It sounded like a man and he was obviously not very happy.

   Valerie managed to calm down somewhat and listen more closely to what was happening around her.

   The basement had only one window with iron bars on it, covered in rust.
   It looked like no one had been down there in many years. The room was completely empty except for the casket-like object next to Valerie, a wooden folding chair and a small table.
   The ceiling wasn’t very high, just enough to let the light from above pass through and not much more.

The man paced around in front of her for several minutes before he came back into view. He was tall, with olive skin and black hair that hung down on his forehead. He had a small beard, but the rest of his face was clean shaven. It looked like he had done a lot of running recently; his face was flushed and his shirt damp with sweat.He started untaping her and she tried hard not to cry out.

“I don’t want to hurt you,” he said as he pulled off the tape from her mouth and then took off the duct tape around her wrists. “But I’m going to have to if you don’t stop screaming. Do you understand?” She just nodded. “Good,” he said with a sigh of relief, “I hate hurting women. They always seem to make such a fuss about it.”

   The man looked around for something to use as a gag and when he found it, he took out one of Valerie’s earrings and put it in her mouth so she couldn’t scream or try to run away.

   “I’m not going to hurt you,” he reassured again, “but I need you to be quiet for just a little bit longer. I promise I’ll let you go as soon as we get there.”

Valerie nodded again and waited patiently for him to untie the ropes around her ankles. He told her that his name was John and that they were going to driveher somewhere she didn’t want to go, but he didn’t say where. When the ropes were finally free, Valerie took a deep breath and said that she was ready to go. She could tell by the look on his face that he was also relieved.

The man put on a pair of rubber gloves and picked up her handbag, which had been just inside the front door of the building, and handed it to Valerie. He then led her through the hallway of the house and out into a car parked in front of it. When Valerie got into the passenger side, he closed her door and told her to buckle up, which she did after looking at him quizzically for a moment. He gave her something else to think about by pulling out a gun and aiming it at her head.

   “Please don’t hurt me,” she said in such a shaky voice that John turned the gun away from her face and put it down on the dashboard instead. Tears were coming to Valerie’s eyes. Before she knew what was happening, he grabbed her by the hair and pulled her head back until it was resting against his shoulder, then took a deep breath and put his lips next to her ear.“Listen here, you little snot. You need to be nice and quiet for about half an hour or so, okay? We got some business to take care of upstairs.”

Valerie nodded her head and said “Okay,” but she didn’t know what else to say. John leaned over and pulled the duct tape off of her mouth. He started to push open her car door, but Valerie stopped him by reaching for the door handle. John pushed harder this time, so hard that she actually fell out of the car onto the pavement. She quickly got back inside as John got in behind the wheel and started up the engine.

She had just buckled up when he put the car in reverse and backed out of his driveway. He told her to keep still as they drove, which she did, not knowing where they were going or what would happen to her after that. Two minutes later, he stopped the car in front of a building without any windows. He turned off the engine and got out of the car, leaving Valerie there alone with her thoughts, which caused tears to come streaming down her cheeks again.

   No more than fifteen minutes had passed when Valerie heard footsteps coming closer, as",0
"Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.","sat next to her in the darkroom and she stroked his hair and kissed him until he fell asleep.

    	Jack woke up in the early morning hours and tiptoed back to bed. Eliza was still sleeping, so he dressed quietly and walked out into the rain to get some fresh air. The street lights shone brightly through the misty rain as he made his way down the street towards town.

As Jack walked, he thought about his grandfather’s death and how it had affected him, especially now that Eliza was dead, too. His father had told him that his grandfather had been sick for a while before he died. Even though he knew this, Jack couldn’t help thinking of all the things they might have done together if his grandfather hadn’t gotten sick- the walks in the woods, fishing trips, and all the other things they used to do together.

Jack reached town just as it started to get light out. The streets were empty except for a few people hurrying into shops and restaurants, getting ready for another day at work or school. From this distance, he could see that all of the restaurants on Main Street were closed up for good. He could see a smallgroup of men gathered on the corner, drinking coffee together while they waited for their chance to head out to the ocean and start their fishing day.

Jack turned around and walked back home. When he reached the house, he saw that everything was dark. It was still raining outside, too hard for anyone to be outside. He couldn’t see Eliza in the living room or the bedroom, so he went upstairs to look in on her. He slowly opened her bedroom door and tiptoed inside.

Eliza’s side of the bedroom was painted blue while his side was pink. The walls were covered with pictures of her family and friends, most of them smiling but some of them with tears running down their faces. Jack looked at all of these pictures, remembering them as if they were his own memories.

The room smelled strongly of Eliza’s perfume. When he opened the closet door, it smelled even stronger. He leaned over Eliza’s dresses and gently touched her wedding dress, which hung on the back wall of the closet. It still had her name on it in white embroidery thread.

He glanced around one more time and then left the room. He walked down the stairs andwent into the living room, where he saw Eliza sitting cross-legged on the floor with her knees drawn up to her chest. She was rocking back and forth.

Jack sat down next to her on the floor, leaned over, and held her hands in his. He gently shook them. “Eliza?” he said softly. Still, she didn’t answer him. Jack sat there for a long time rocking back and forth with Eliza, not really knowing what to do or what to say. Everything he said felt wrong- it was almost as if she would answer him back if he spoke loud enough or long enough. Jack began to notice that there was a smell of alcohol in the room, and he wondered where Adam Wilson got it from.

Adam came in through the front door with a bottle of liquor in his hand, sloshing it as he walked. When he saw Jack on the floor holding Eliza’s hands, he frowned and walked across the room to them. He looked at both of them for a moment and then sighed before taking another swig from the bottle.

 “How is she doing?” Adam asked finally.

Jack didn’t reply at first, soAdam looked over at Eliza. She was rocking back and forth in the same pattern that Jack had been doing.

“Okay, I guess,” Jack said finally.

Adam nodded, but then suddenly asked out of nowhere, “Do you want me to stop seeing her?”

Jack felt his jaw drop as he struggled to find the words. “I- I don’t know what to say. It isn’t my business anymore. It was never really my business, but it was my wife.”

Adam laughed bitterly and shook his head before taking another drink of the liquor. “Never your wife, Jack. She never loved you like you thought she did.”

Jack felt anger rise up in his throat, but he swallowed it down and nodded. He had heard this a million times already and he didn’t know what to say about it anymore. Jack stood up and walked out of the room so that Adam could talk to Eliza alone- this was their business now, not his. Adam had been crying, but when he saw Jack going out of the room, they stopped. He said something about watching over her while Jack was gone.Jack nodded and left.

    The next day, people came to see him to give their condolences. They talked for a while about how much Eliza had meant to them. Jack started drinking heavily after they left because he couldn’t be bothered with conversations like that. The only person who didn’t leave was Abbie, and she asked if she could tell him a story. Jack nodded and listened with half an ear as she talked about her life with her wife before she died- how they met, how they fell in love, etc… She told him that it hadn’t been easy for them at all and that there had been times when they thought about calling it quits. She said that the pain and sorrow never fully left them until she passed away.

  Eventually, Abbie finished and asked Jack if he wanted to hear another story or if there was anything else she could do for him. Jack said that he would like another story, but the only thing that Jack really wanted was to forget everything that had happened.

Eliza sat on the ground rocking back and forth. She would still talk sometimes, but it was in a mumble when she did. Her eyes would flicker open and close slowly as if she was trying to stay awake but couldn’t.",0
Anna Cooper must find a way to stop the darkness from taking over the school and protect the innocent students.,"teacher asks Lily if she has ever had sexual feelings towards another woman, but Lily refuses to answer any of her questions.

- After school, Laura tells Maryanne that she and the other girls now call Anna “the witch” because of her attitude. The two girls agree that they should do something about this problem themselves since no one else will help them. Maryanne suggests that they ask Anna if she can talk to their parents about it; however, Laura refuses to do so because she knows that it will only make things worse for them.

- That night, Anna asks Daniel if he has heard any more stories about Lily’s classmates threatening Maryanne. He confirms this and adds that they have not been acting like normal children either. Daniel is sure that whatever is going on in the town will affect their children as well, so he is very concerned about keeping them safe.

- After Anna has gone to bed, Daniel sits up in bed and thinks about what has been happening at the school. He remembers how his third-grade teacher walked into her classroom with a black eye and broken arm one day after being attacked by a group of boys. He also remembers how she refused to talk about what happened and left right after school was dismissed. This event had a profound effect on him as a child and is still affecting him now, so he decides that he must do something about the situation at the school so that it will not affect his family.

- The next morning, Anna arrives at the school earlier than usual. She goes into the building and heads straight to the principal’s office. As she approaches his door, she sees that it is closed, but she decides to knock anyway just in case he is awake. She knocks once on the door, but there is no answer. She knocks again, but there is still no answer; she begins to wonder whether or not she woke him up. She decides to put her ear up against the door in hopes of hearing some noise coming from inside; however, there is only silence. Anna turns around and leaves the office because she is not trying to disturb him at this early hour. She goes back outside and heads for the school’s main office. As she walks down the hall, she stops by a classroom door that is open; it belongs to Miss Miller’s class. Anna looks inside and sees that all the lights are off, so she decides to go in and check on her.She takes a quick peek inside the room and notices that everything is quiet and still, so she walks in to investigate. She looks around the room for a moment but does not find anyone there; the room is completely vacant, like no one has been there at all. Anna is confused by this and wonders where everyone could have gone. She decides to stand in the doorway for a moment to see if anyone will come out of class soon. Just as she is thinking this, she hears noises coming from behind her. She turns around and finds that Lily Washington has emerged from the classroom door and is walking toward her. Lily waves at Anna and smiles; Anna returns the gesture but keeps her eyes peeled because she does not trust her. Lily asks Anna what she is doing standing there, but Anna ignores Lily’s question and tells her to return to class. Anna reaches out and grabs Lily’s arm, but instead of pulling on it, she pushes it away from her body. She tells Lily to go home because there is no school today. Lily frowns and begins to argue with Anna about this, so Anna drags her toward the doorway and pushes her out into the hallway. As they are walking down the hall together, Lily asks Anna why she thinks that thereis no school today. Anna explains to her that it is Friday and everyone should be at home doing their work. Anna looks over at the clock in the hallway while she is talking; it says 8:59 a.m., and Miss Miller’s class starts at 8:50 a.m., so class must be over by now. They walk outside and Lily begins to run away from Anna, but Anna runs after her until she stops her from attempting to leave the building. She reminds Lily that it is not safe for her to be outside right now because of all the bad things that have been happening at the school and tells her that she should forget about school and just start to work on her homework.

Lily says nothing in response; instead she whines like a little girl who wants something but does not have the money to buy it. Anna explains that working on homework means doing well in school; however, Lily tells her that people who do well in school are not nice people. Anna’s eyes widen at these words and her mouth opens slightly before closing. She tries to explain to Lily that most of the students at the school are very nice; in fact, she thinks that Lily is a very nice girl herself. But before Anna canget any more words out, Lily runs off and runs around the building trying to catch up with her friends from school. Anna has no choice but to watch her flee from the doors of the building and jump into a waiting car that is ready to drive away.

Anna waits for about ten minutes then walks back inside. She hears a crash come from behind the door just as she is about to enter, so she hurries away from it. It must be from one of the boys, she thinks to herself because Maryanne would not have done such a thing. When she gets back inside, she walks down the hallway and looks for Daniel Cooper, but he says nothing when he sees her so Anna walks back down the hall and heads toward Miss Miller’s classroom. She finds all of the chairs pushed in and the room empty, so she follows her instinct and takes a look inside Maryanne’s second grade classroom. It is empty as well so Anna moves on to Miss Miller’s first grade classroom. She finds that it is also empty, but she notices a pile of books on the floor beneath Miss Miller’s desk. She bends down to pick up one of the books in an attempt to read it, but when she does, she feels a sharp pain in her back and everything goes black.",0
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"friends, and she had stopped taking part in the activities she used to enjoy doing in her spare time. Shannon was spending more time alone at home because her father didn’t seem interested in doing anything with her, and so it seemed as though she had no one else to turn to but herself. “She’s trying to cope with her loss, and I don’t think she’s learned to do that yet,” Uncle Jeff said.

Shannon was sitting on the edge of her bed, holding a box of oil paints that was given to her by her mother before she passed away from cancer. She started crying uncontrollably once again upon seeing both her uncle and father approach her room slowly. “What are you doing here?” Shannon asked, wiping the tears from her face and standing up. There were paint stains on her cheeks, nose and hands. Her uncle could see that she had been crying for a while.

“I came to talk to you,” her father said.

“About what?” Shannon asked, turning away from them. She started pacing around the room as she spoke. “You don’t care how I feel, so why should I tell you?” she asked.

Her father stepped inside the room and placed a hand on her shoulder. “I do care about how you feel daughter,” he said softly. Her uncle noticed that there were small tears forming in her father’s eyes.

“Yeah, right. If you did care, you wouldn’t have left us all behind to deal with this grief on our own,” she said, turning to face her father directly now. She looked in his eyes and saw that he had started crying now. “He doesn’t care.” She turned to face her uncle now. “You don’t care either, do you?”

Her uncle sighed and shook his head slowly. He did care, but he knew that she wouldn’t believe him just yet. “No, I do care Shannon,” he said gently.

She looked at him for a few moments while the tears continued to fall from her father’s eyes and then nodded and walked over to sit on her bed. The two men stood nearby, unsure of what to do next. Her father was crying now,  so he didn’t know how to handle this situation.

Shannon saw the box of oil paints on her nightstand. She picked it up and opened it slowly, letting the tears continue to stream down her face as she did so. She stared at the empty canvas in front of her for a few moments before she took out a large brush and dipped it into a small jar of red paint. Then, Shannon started to paint.

She started painting out of her own grief and loneliness, but as she worked, she found that somehow painting helped to ease it. She painted for hours and didn’t eat anything. Shannon’s need to paint became so strong that she decided to clear out her attic and turn it into a studio, so that she could paint there whenever she felt like it.

She turned her old wooden desk into a workbench and filled the walls with canvases, paints, brushes, and other painting materials. Shannon moved her easel to the center of the room and placed two chairs in front of it. She hung some potted plants in the corners of the room for decoration purposes. The attic was small, but she didn’t mind that. It was just right for her. It also reminded  her of the attic in the family’s old barn.

Shannon would spend hours in the studio, painting and listening to music on her headphones. She discovered that drawing people helped her to feel connected with her mother once more, and so she would draw portraits of her mother over and over again. The  act of drawing also helped Shannon to cope with her feelings.

Shannon started to put her own feelings into the paintings, too. She could often be found staring at one of her own unfinished paintings, which had two figures standing in a meadow. The figures were very dark and pale, reflecting Shannon’s feelings of being filled with darkness but also feeling a glimmer of light at the same time.

This painting became an outlet for Shannon and she would often sit and stare at it for long periods of time to try to work some of her pain and confusion out on it. Sometimes, she would cover the painted surface with salt and trace the outlines of her paintings in a faint blue wash. This felt like she was connecting with someone, especially since her own mother could no longer speak to her. Shannon felt as if she were having a conversation with her mother by painting the images over and over again. Shannon started to feel closer to her paintings and knew that they helped her to heal.

Shannon painted for hours every day, with only a short break for lunch which she always ate while standing up. She drank a lot of water so that she wouldn’t feel weak or tired. She felt almost as peaceful as when she was painting and felt that it was her therapy. Shannon painted every night until she finished a painting, and then she would start a new one. Sometimes, she would paint for six hours straight without stopping, and this helped to ease the pain in her heart. Sometimes, while painting, Shannon felt like",1
Jenna wakes up in the hospital a week later to find that she is now a vampire.,"“How long have I been out?” Jenna asked.

“A week. You just regained consciousness about ten minutes ago.”

Jenna smiled weakly and then looked around the room again. She noticed a brown door to her right that was labeled ‘Restroom’. There was also a window next to it. She noticed the lights were dim, but they were on, which made it brighter than the hospital rooms she had seen before. There were no medical instruments on the bed stand next to her, and there were no wires or tubes connected to her body. She moved her legs and realized that she had no casts on them.

“Where am I?” Jenna asked.

“You are in the hospital,” the blond man said. He sounded surprised by the question.

Jenna sat up and started rubbing her neck. “My neck hurts,” she said.

The blond man moved his hand away from Jenna’s and helped her sit up on the bed. She leaned back on the pillow, which was white with blue trim. As she moved, it moved to help steady her body.

“Where am I?” Jenna asked again.

“You were brought here a few minutes ago after being stabbed by a mugger,” the blond man explained patiently. “I am Dr. Damian Henchman, and I have been here to make sure that you recover.”

Jenna moved her other hand to her abdomen and felt a thin bandage covering her wound. She moved the bandage and saw a red line where the wound had been.

“Why am I in hospital?” she asked slowly.

“Because the hospital is the best place for you right now,” Dr. Henchman answered with a smile. “You are going to be fine. You have healed quickly, and you should leave here soon to go back home.”

“Home?” Jenna asked, as realization started to settle in.

Dr. Henchman answered before she could continue. “Yes, home. You have moved from the world of the living into the world of the dead. You will be one of us now, and you will  not age again. You are like me now, and I will help you to adjust to your new life, but we must hurry because we do not want anyone to learn about your situation before you leave here.”

“How long have I been here?” Jenna asked again.

“You have been here for a week, and the doctors have said that you have recovered nicely, but we will take your word for it,” he said with a smile. “Now, we need to begin your transformation into a vampire. Can you stand up so that I can explain the transformation process?”

Jenna tried to stand, but her legs were weak and she had difficulty balancing. She could feel powerful muscles in her legs beneath the bandages that covered them, and she discovered that she now had superhuman strength in addition to her new enhanced speed and agility. She turned sideways so that she now had a wide stance and was able to balance better.

Jenna turned her head to look directly at Dr. Henchman. “How? How can turning into a vampire be possible? How do I know that you are telling me the truth?” Jenna now realized that she could run much faster than Dr. Henchman could ever hope to run, and she turned to run from him while calling out, “I have superhuman strength and speed!” as she raced into the far corner of her hospital room. 

Dr. Henchman ran after her, but Jenna was just too fast for him. She leapt out of her hospital bed with superhuman strength and landed in a crouch in front of Liam’s bed, which was now empty because he had been moved to another wing of the hospital. She turned around and saw Liam cross the second floor balcony. He leapt off the balcony with superhuman speed and landed three stories below on a nearby car in one smooth motion. He turned to face Jenna and said, “Trust me. There is life after death!”

Jenna was starting to catch on to the new rules of her new world, but she wasn’t quite ready to let Liam Cross back into her life. She had been living on her own for a while now, and she could take care of herself. Jenna was still adjusting to all of the changes that had taken place in her life, and she needed time adjust to this latest development before she could try to make sense of it.

Jenna decided that she would let Liam Cross try to talk her into it after she had a little more time to think about everything. She would let him explain what had happened, and then she would make up her own mind about what she should do. Jenna had been living in survival mode for the last week. She was finally beginning to come down from her adrenaline rush now that she was out of danger. She needed some time to adjust, and then she would decide if Liam Cross could be trusted or not. She decided that Liam Cross would have to adjust to her reality, because she wasn’t adjusting to his.

Jenna started slowly backing up through the hospital. “Have you figured out how to change back yet?” asked Jenna. “I think so,” replied Liam. “Change back right now! ” said Jenna. She was very scared of vampires, and she was worried that Liam wasn’t really who he claimed to be. She wanted to see if he responded the way that a scared human would respond, or if he would do something inhuman like sprout fangs and hiss at her.

Liam Cross didn’t show any reaction. “Jenna, I haven’t always been a vampire. I was once just like you,” said Liam. He smiled at her and took a few steps toward her. “I was born human, just like you were, and I worked in a bookshop. I used to go to movies and watch football on Sunday afternoons with my family,” said Liam.

“If you don’t change back right now, I am going to scream so loud that everyone in this building is going to hear it!” said Jenna. She was clearly getting more panicked.

Liam took another couple steps toward her, smiling the whole time. “I know what you are thinking right now,” said Liam. He gave her a reassuring look. “You are wondering why I haven’t attacked you yet. You probably think that you are going to end up like those people on the internet who get their throats ripped out by vampires,” said Liam.

Jenna didn’t say anything. She just looked at him.

“I promise that I won’t hurt you,” said Liam. “I want to be your friend. That’s why you need to listen to me. There is a group of vampires in Shepherdstown known as The True Cross, and they are responsible for creating me and many other vampires. I also want to tell you that your attacker was probably one of them. You need to find out who did this to you,” said Liam.

Jenna opened and closed her mouth a few times without saying anything. She must have been thinking about what Liam had just said, because she finally spoke up again. “I don’t understand any of this,” said Jenna.

Liam gave her another sympathetic look. “What questions do you have? I promise that if you ask me anything at all about this, I will answer it to the best of my ability,” said Liam.",1
Brad realizes the error of his ways and comes to appreciate Shannon for the wonderful woman she was.,"found out from his mother that his father had been released from the hospital and was doing okay, he started to feel guilty for lying to her about where he was going this past week.

	Brad had told him that it wasn’t a big deal to lie to someone in his or her own family, but Jeremy didn’t agree with him. He knew he would have never forgiven himself if something had happened to his dad while Jeremy was lying to him and didn’t know about it.

	He also figured that he deserved the lecture his mother was going to give him when they got home because of his lying...he just hoped it wasn’t going to be too bad. He knew that lying was wrong, even though Brad told him it wasn’t.

	When they pulled into their driveway, Jeremy felt really tired. He sat in the driveway while his mother parked her car in the garage and took her bag out of the trunk. He leaned forward on his seat and rested his head against the headrest as he stared up into space for a moment, trying to imagine how Brad must have felt just before he had learned that Shannon was dead.

	He wondered if Brad had ever loved Shannon sincerely, or if he hadjust been using her for his own purposes. He wondered if he would ever be able to love anyone as much as Brad had loved Shannon, or even half as much...maybe not even a quarter of that. He wondered if Brad truly realized what an incredible woman she was and had been, and how he would have felt if he had died knowing that his wife was dead because she couldn’t bear the thought of going on without him.

	Jeremy sighed as he looked up at the dark sky and saw a shooting star go by over his head. He closed his eyes and wished that things were different between him and his mom, and between him and his dad. He wished that he could see Brad again, but he knew it wasn’t going to happen for a very long time – maybe not for several years.

	Finally, when he thought about it that way, he began to realize how much guilt really would have eaten him up if something bad had happened while he was away. And at the same time, he realized that his mother might never forgive him if something did happen to Jeremy while she knew where he was but kept quiet about it.

	So in the end, Jeremy decided that maybe what Brad said about lying wasn’t sobad. But only a little bit. Still, he was glad to be back home, no matter how much it would take him to get used to his old routine again.

Brad Barton did not understand why his son felt guilty about having lied to him. He had lied to Shannon too and, once upon a time, to his father and mother too – and they had forgiven him for all of them. He figured he would eventually be able to forgive Jeremy too. He certainly hoped he would, because it grieved him to think of his son suffering as he had suffered when his first wife had died.

	He remembered how good Shannon was in bed, and how she could always make him feel better when he was upset. She was a true friend too and no matter what problem he came to her with, she always seemed to find a way of making it better.

He also remembered how sweet she smelled when he first went to her bed at night...like honey and flowers mixed together. He had missed those things a lot, but he figured if they were still too painful for Jeremy to deal with, he would wait until later to ask him about them.

They both needed some time away from each other first anyway. They had been through toomuch together in such a short time, and it was bound to take them some time to settle back into their old routine. He did not mind waiting a little while longer for Jeremy to share his secrets with him. In the meantime, he hoped that he would be able to make Shannon proud of him by regaining the respect of his son.

Brad could see that it would take some time for his son to get used to having him around again and that was fine by Brad, because being around was all he wanted at the moment.

	He made a bee-line for the liquor cabinet where he kept his old bottle of scotch. He poured himself a stiff drink and took a long sip from the glass. 	“That’s good,” he said, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand in an attempt to catch some of the dribble that had escaped onto his chin.

He was glad that Jeremy had stayed behind to take care of the house while he was gone because otherwise Brad might have gotten too drunk to notice what was going on around him – and there were a lot of things that needed his attention.

	First, he checked the answering machine to see if anyone had called while he was away. There were two messages from Shannon’s mother Karen, who was still trying to get in touch with him. Brad hit the delete button and decided that he would rather not talk to her, at least for the time being.

His next stop was the kitchen where he went through all of the drawers looking for anything that belonged to Shannon. He found some pictures from their wedding and other random photographs that brought back so many memories for him. His favorites were the ones of Shannon and Jeremy together because they made him realize how much he missed them both. When he saw a picture of himself holding Shannon in his arms on their wedding day, all of the anger and resentment that had built up inside of him dissipated and he began to feel like himself again.

Tears ran freely down his face as he picked up Shannon’s picture from their wedding day, kissed it gently on her lips, and then held it next to his heart. Brad cried until there were no more tears left in him. The tears flowed unashamedly because he knew that there would be no one watching him this time as he wept over the death of his beloved wife.

When he finally stopped crying, Brad took a long look at himself in the mirrorand realized that he had been a fool. Shannon was the best thing that had ever happened to him and he had taken her for granted. He now knew that he would never find another woman who loved him as much as Shannon had and he vowed to never take her love for granted again.

Brad went into Jeremy’s room and found him fast asleep in his bed. He sat down on the edge of the bed and watched his son sleep for a few minutes before gently kissing him on the forehead and tucking him in. Brad then went into his own bedroom, undressed, and got into bed where he finally allowed himself to fall asleep.",1
Natalie goes to the police and helps them apprehend Trevor Lockwood before he can hurt anyone else .,"with longer hair and different skin tones. They all seemed to be in the same business as Natalie as their shirts had initials on them that read “CPA,” “CPT,” and “CFA.”
Natalie didn’t know what to think of this situation as she stood in the foyer looking around at all the women. The woman who had brought Natalie there gave her a business card and told her that she was not allowed to leave until they were done interviewing her. Instantly, Natalie knew this wasn’t something she wanted to be a part of, but she was unsure how to get out of the situation. She had been forced into this whole experience against her will so she knew there would be nothing easy about getting away from here.
During this time, Trevor was still tied up in the basement thinking that the others were done with him for good. After being there for a few hours, he began losing hope that he would be rescued. As he lay on his cot, he wondered why he had taken it upon himself to steal the money from those three men. He knew that what they had done was wrong, but he hadn’t realized just how much danger his actions would puthim in.
He wondered if Natalie had called the police and told them where he was. He hoped she hadn’t because that would mean they wouldn’t be able to find him before the cops got there and he feared what might happen if they did.
As he laid there on his cot waiting for whatever might happen next, he couldn’t help but wonder why Natalie had been so willing to accept the money in trade for her freedom. Trevor wondered if she had done it because she truly wanted to or because she desperately needed the money.
Trevor was finally able to pry one of his arms free from the rope which kept him bound and tied to his cot. After doing this, he was able to free himself and run out of the basement as fast as he could before he got caught.
When Natalie saw Trevor running past her through the foyer she was so startled that she almost fell over herself. She couldn’t believe that Trevor Lockwood had managed to get past her guard and get out of the house before she could stop him. There was no way she could let him escape because he had already killed two people in a previous incident and she suspected that he might be a serial killer.Natalie ran out of the front door to chase after him but she wasn’t quick enough. She lost sight of Trevor’s back somewhere in Times Square as he sprinted down the street.
Now that Trevor was gone, Natalie had no choice but to go to the police. However, she didn’t know where she thought Trevor could have possibly gotten away to. It was a fairly busy area so it should have been easy for her to figure out where he went, but her head was still reeling from the shock of seeing him escape so suddenly.
Trevor didn’t have much time to think about what had just happened because once the adrenaline wore off he knew that his body would start to experience the pain from being tied up all day. Trevor knew it would be a long night ahead of him so he started sprinting as fast as he could without breaking his ankle. He knew that Natalie wouldn’t give up until she caught him, but he hoped if he ran far enough away from her that she wouldn’t find him again.
Trevor had been running for about twenty minutes when he noticed an alley which had a dumpster placed next to a building’s side entrance. He decided that this wouldbe the best place for him to hide since it was late at night and nobody would think twice about seeing him there.
Trevor started digging around in the dumpster until he found an old cardboard box and some newspapers to keep himself warm with. He figured that it would be a good idea to change his clothes since he didn’t want anyone recognizing him from the newspaper photos that just came out. After changing his clothes, Trevor crawled into the box and waited for morning.

   Natalie slowly walked to the front of the police station where she found a few officers standing outside waiting for her. She approached them and they escorted her inside without saying a word to her.
Even though it had been hours since she had seen Trevor Lockwood, she was still scared that he might come back and kill her at any moment. She was always worried that if the police didn’t catch him in time, he would find her and kill her out of spite for the fact that she escaped from his clutches.
Once Natalie arrived at the station, they showed her into an interrogation room where there were two officers waiting for her. One of them introduced himself as Detective Wilford and then the other one introduced himself as Detective Crenshaw. After introducing themselves, the detectives sat opposite Natalie and asked her to tell them what happened between the time she met Trevor Lockwood up until when she escaped from him. She talked about having met Trevor online, how he had pretended to be interested in a relationship with her and how he lured her to his apartment. She told them everything that happened, including the part about how she saw Trevor’s collection of clothes used to blindfold women.
Detective Wilford and Detective Wilford were both impressed by the fact that she was able to escape from Trevor’s apartment after being held captive for so long and they asked her how she managed to do it. Natalie told them that Trevor Lockwood turned his back on her when he went downstairs when she heard the car pulling up outside. It was at that moment that Natalie managed to free herself from the ropes Trevor had tied her up with by using the ropes to make a makeshift lasso.
“That’s remarkable,” Detective Wilford said after listening to her story. “Not many people are able to escape from a serial killer like that.”
Detective Wilford agreed with Detective Wilford and then he asked Natalie how she thought Trevor had managed to keep her trapped in his apartment for so long. Natalie told them that she thought Trevor had probably done it before and that he might have done it to other women.
The detectives thanked Natalie for her help and then they asked her if she would be willing to help them apprehend Trevor Lockwood. Natalie agreed to help them and so the detectives put out an APB for Trevor’s car.
A few hours later, the police found Trevor’s car parked in a garage in Times Square. They surrounded the garage and then they called out for Trevor to come out with his hands up. Trevor came out of the garage with his hands up and he was promptly arrested by the police.
Natalie Harper was a hero for helping the police catch a dangerous serial killer like Trevor Lockwood before he could hurt anyone else .",0
"Jack goes through the motions of living, but he can't see any purpose in it without her.","he knew was that his wife had betrayed him and that he shouldn’t have been surprised by it. He also knew that there wasn’t anything more to be done about it, and that she would probably never come back to him now.

He had tried calling her on the phone a few times since they got home, but she hadn’t answered any of his calls. Eliza didn’t want to talk to him right now, and there was nothing he could do about it. Adam didn't want to talk to him either, but that wasn't so surprising because Adam was Eliza's lover.

About ten minutes later, he sat down on the couch and stared at the photograph again. Now Jack had more questions than he had when he first saw it. One of them was, “How long have they been seeing each other?” He didn’t know if she had started having an affair with Adam after their daughter was born or not. Maybe it had even been going on before then.

   He tried to imagine what she should have done differently, and all he could think of was that she should have kept her love for him as strong as ever, but she obviously hadn’t done that. How could someone stay in love with someone else while they were married?  And even if she had beenable to do it, why would she have the need to see other men while she was married?

   Jack couldn’t even imagine that happening. He would never want to be with anyone else but her, no matter what happened between the two of them. He realized that there was a possibility that Eliza felt the same way, but her actions indicated otherwise.

   After fifteen minutes passed he got up and went over to his desk, where he picked up a sheet of paper and wrote something down. Then he turned around and looked at the picture again for inspiration before he rewrote the message from Eliza on the note. After staring at it for a minute, he stuck it on the table next to the picture and then left his apartment.

   When Jack arrived at the hospital to pick up his daughter, he found her in the children’s ward with Adam Wilson, who was holding her in his arms while she slept.

Adam turned around as soon as Jack came into the room and said, “Hello there.”

“Hello,” Jack replied while staring at Adam. He thought that it was strange that Eliza would leave their daughter with Adam when she knew that Jack might come topick her up.

   “How have you been since the last time I saw you?” Adam asked while he gently stroked Abbie’s hair.

“Not good,” Jack answered while he tried to keep his gaze on the floor instead of looking at Eliza’s lover. “I don’t know how I can cope with not having her here anymore. She was everything to me, and now I don’t know what I am supposed to do with myself or how to live without her.”

“You should get some help with that,” Adam said while he continued to look at Jack. “There are people out there who can help you heal and move on with your life. Have you talked to anyone about what happened?”

“No, I haven’t had time for that and I don’t know if I want anyone else but her helping me through this, even though it would be easier if someone else were. I guess I should have done that a long time ago, but I wanted to wait until Eliza got back from vacation so she could help me through this.”“I know it’s hard. I wish there was something I could say to make it all better. I can see how much pain you are in and I’m sorry that you are going through this. Please know that if there is anything you need, just let me know.”

Adam stood up and offered his hand to Jack. Jack was touched by Adam’s kindness and gave him a firm handshake before he headed towards the door with his daughter in his arms.

“I hope that nothing ever happens to you, Jack Barlow, because I don’t think that Eliza will take it well if you leave her alone forever.”

Jack smiled at Adam and nodded his head in thanks before he walked out of the room with Abbie now in his arms. He was so full of grief that he could hardly stand up straight and had to focus on not falling over because he felt like he was going to pass out at any moment. He took some deep breaths and tried to talk to himself in order to calm down, but nothing seemed to work and he continued walking towards the elevator until he was finally able to control his breathing again.He stood in the elevator for a moment, fighting back tears and trying to focus on his little girl.

	The doors opened and he walked out of the hospital and back onto the sidewalk. It was a beautiful day outside with light blue skies and puffy clouds floating by. Jack looked up at the sky as he crossed one of the streets on his way home. The sun was warm against his face and he enjoyed having it shine on him after being inside for so long. He had not realized how much time had passed, but by the time he got home it was already dark outside. He opened the door to his house quietly so as not to wake Abbie who was sleeping in her room.

He slipped off his shoes and made sure that she was covered with a blanket before he turned off the light beside her bed. He sat down in an armchair next to her bed and looked down at her peaceful face for a moment, almost feeling guilty for being happy that she was asleep because he knew that she would wake up happy in the morning while he would still be miserable. He gave her a kiss on the forehead and moved the chair closer to the bed before leaning back into it and closing his eyes so that all he could see is Abbie’s",0
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,"side door. She stood behind the reception desk for several seconds, listening closely, trying to determine whether she could hear anyone inside. There was the murmur of voices in the background and maybe even some faint music, but she couldn’t make out any actual words.

	With that information, she slowly made her way to the back of the desk where there was a small supply closet and waited there in complete silence for several minutes. She didn’t really care that she had snuck into her own building through an unlocked door or that she was hiding in a supply closet – it seemed appropriate in some way – but she did want to make sure she wasn’t being followed. She made no noise except for the soft padding of her feet on the carpet flooring, trying to keep them quiet enough that they couldn’t be heard from within the room.

	After what seemed like an eternity, and was probably only a few minutes, she saw someone come out of the bathroom and into view near the reception desk. It was Kyle. He smiled at her when he saw her and motioned for her to come out of the closet and follow him.

	She stood up from behind the desk and walked towards him. She took a deepbreath as she tried to steady her nerves, but as soon as she passed the threshold of the closet, her anxiety shot through the roof. The voices in the other room were talking and laughing loudly, music was playing loudly as well, and there were several people crowded near the counter; one of them even had their arm around Kyle’s waist.

	The only thing that kept her from running out of there was the look on Kyle’s face – he looked so happy to see her. The thought of disappointing him, or hurting his feelings, held her in place as she walked towards him; it also helped that he was blocking everyone else from the closet so they couldn’t see her.

	“Hey!” he said excitedly as she came around the corner, and pulled her in for a big hug. She returned his embrace with one of her own, happy to see him as well, even if this wasn’t how she wanted to see him. He kissed her cheek and put his arm around her, letting it linger there for a moment before letting go again. His attention was already on someone else, on a woman who was standing not too far from them; it seemed like she was trying to get his attention, and Kyle was happy to oblige.

	“Hi,” he said as they separated. “This is Aimee.”

	Aimee smiled as she shook Kyle’s hand, and then looked up to smile at him as well. He had a boyish charm about him that she couldn’t help but find endearing, but he didn’t seem the least bit interested in her. She felt a pang of hurt inside at the thought of being rejected so easily, but Kyle was already saying something else to her that caught her attention.

	“I wanted you to meet someone. This is Patricia; we work together at the hospital. This is Aimee.”

	Kyle did not go into any further explanation about Patricia or what she does at the hospital, and although Aimee felt hurt she decided not to push the issue; there were other things that were much more pressing at the moment.

	“Have you come here to join us?” Patricia asked Aimee, moving close enough for them to touch and smiling warmly at her.

	Aimee smiled back, feeling comfortable in Patricia’s company. “Kyleinvited me over because I haven’t been going to the club since my divorce. He told me I should come hang out with people who understand me.”

	Patricia put her arm around Aimee and squeezed her gently.

	“We do understand you, don’t we?” Patricia said gently, and her eyes locked on Aimee’s for a moment before turning back to Kyle. “You told me about her at the club. I thought it was very noble of you to offer her a home away from home... or a place to belong or whatever it was you said.”

	Aimee could feel herself blushing at the praise, and she looked over toward Kyle. He seemed to be in a world of his own as he smiled at Patricia while listening to Aimee talk about herself.

	“Thank you,” she said to Kyle after a moment, smiling shyly at him. “I think your club really is a good idea for me. I think I can offer some of the younger people there something they might not have experienced yet and that could be very beneficial for their growth as young adults.”“My pleasure,” Kyle said as he looked up from the television and shifted his attention toward Aimee. “I think you’ll be a great help to us with the youth group here. The kids are dying for someone their own age to talk to, and I think you can fill that void.”

	Aimee nodded enthusiastically. “I never had anyone my age to talk to when I was growing up,” she said, “and it definitely stunted my development socially... but I think talking to them is the least I can do... and what better way than by sharing my experiences with them?”

	Aimee felt like she was rambling because she had run out of things to say, but Kyle just smiled at her and raised his glass in a toast. Patricia followed suit, but it seemed to Aimee that there was more meaning in her gesture than Kyle’s.

	“Here’s to helping the kids,” Kyle said with a smile, and both Aimee and Patricia responded by raising their glasses as well.

	“Speaking of which,” Aimee said once she had set her glass down",0
"Eliza died six months ago, and her husband Jack still can't accept it.","Eliza went down to the local doctor, and he told her, “You’ve got cancer.” The diagnosis was made in a matter-of-fact way, as though he were offering milk or butter. “And you’ll have to get rid of it, Eliza. You’re pregnant, you know. And we will have the baby-it will be tough, but we can do it. We can, and I promise you that everything will be fine. But I cannot stress enough how important it is for you to get that lump checked out by the doctor. Cancer – it’s a scary word, but we’ll deal with it. We’ll deal with it as a family. We just have to be strong. And once that lump is gone, then we can begin our lives together as a family-because we are a family, Eliza;  we can be whatever we want to be.”

Eliza grabbed his hand and kissed it. “I love you, and I promise I will go to the doctor-tomorrow, okay? As soon as I get up tomorrow, I’ll go.” 

Jack smiled at her. “Okay, I’m going to go see my dad now; I spoke to him on the phone just before you rang and he said he wanted to see me. He sounded funny-he said it was important. Just sit here for a second, I’ll be back in a few minutes.”

Eliza rested her head against the pillow and closed her eyes, listening to Jack’s soft footsteps as he walked down the hallway. She didn’t have to wait very long before he came walking back into the room with his father, who was shuffling more than walking, and leaning on Jack for support.

“It must be hard for her to walk,” said Eliza.

His father ignored the question and looked at his watch. “The funeral home closes in half an hour-if we’re going to get there on time, we need to leave now.”

There was a funeral home across the street from the hospital where Eliza was staying. They had come there right after Jack had spoken to one of the doctors, and had decided that it would be best not to wait until tomorrow to bury her. There wasn’t really any point, Jack had said; they were moving, and there was no way they would be able to come back here for the funeral.

They moved to a nearby armchair and sat down, with his father in the middle of them. They didn’t speak for almost a full minute. There was no movement in the room at all-not even a quiet creak as one of the doors opened and closed.

Finally, his father cleared his throat and said, “I want to thank you again for moving to be with us, Jack. It means a lot to me. Moving to the Midwest is hard enough as it is, but I think it might have been even harder if you weren’t here right now. This would have been too much for me to handle on my own. Thank you.”

That brought a tear to Jack’s eye and he wiped it away with an unsteady hand. “Thank you, dad,” he replied.

There was another uncomfortable silence as they all continued to sit in the armchair, with his father between them and each of their eyes  focused on a different spot on the wall.

Finally, his mother broke the silence by asking, “Why are you here? You don’t even know her.”

Jack’s eyes darted to his father for support, but he didn’t get any. The old man was too busy trying to blink back his own tears.

“I know her, mom. We were married over four years- and I missed the first two of those years while I was in Iraq. So that brings our time in total up to six full years together, if you count the times when we lived in different states. And I think I know her pretty well after all that time.”

The old woman just sat there, looking at Jack angrily as though he was an imposter. Finally, she said, “She was a good girl. She would have moved to California with you if she had lived. But instead, you moved here to be closer to family, didn’t you? Why did you do that? Did you move here instead of moving to California because it would be easier for me to visit you here?”

Jack just stared back at her in a mixture of confusion and horror. He moved out here to live with his parents because they needed help. They were old, and they needed someone to drive them places and take care of them. He didn’t move out here because he wanted to be closer to his mother. He moved out here because he couldn’t live alone, not after Eliza had died.

The old woman stood up and began to pace around the living room. “You moved out here because it was easier for you, didn’t you? You don’t care about me. All you care about is moving to California. You’re just like your mother. She moved out here when she was twenty-five, just like you did, and then she turned her back on me when I got sick. She moved to California to be close to her friends, just like you did, and all I ended up with was this living room full of boxes.”

She moved to the door. “Well? What are you going to say now?”

Jack moved into the living room and grabbed the old woman’s hand before she could leave. “No",0
"Kitty begins her investigation by speaking to the various dogs in the park, but none of them seem to be very helpful.","very far with the investigation because she only found one body. She spent most of the time playing with all the dogs instead.

    She liked Harry Houndstooth because he was so big and strong and yet he was also very gentle with her. He let her climb all over him and tickle his neck with her whiskers. She thought he smelled a little funny but she liked him anyway because he had such a kind face.

    She also had fun playing with Betty Beagle, who was very quick and clever, but sometimes she just wanted to have a nap even more than she wanted to play a game.

    Sergei Snipe was funny because he tried to run away from her but he could never do it properly because his legs were so short and fat. She liked the way his feet looked even though they were very weird because they were covered in thick fur instead of paws. She tried to chase him but he was too fast for her so she gave up trying to catch him.

    The other dog that Kitty liked a lot was Captain Kiddo because she liked the way that his ears flopped backwards and she thought his very shiny coat would make a great blanket. She liked to have a rest on his bigback but he wasn’t very cuddly so she didn’t stay there for as long as she wanted to.

    To Kitty, all the dogs had their own special qualities and she loved to spend time with them all because they were her friends. She didn’t like any one of them more than the others even though none of them were anything like her. She liked it when they all played together because they were all so different yet they got along well together.

	In between playing with the dogs, Kitty also tried to ask them if they had seen anything suspicious that day but none of them seemed to know anything about it. They all said that they hadn’t seen a thing so she decided that maybe she would have to go somewhere else for information.

	Once all the dogs had been walked and fed, Kitty got ready to leave because she had more investigating to do. She didn’t want any of the dogs accompanying her so Betty Beagle stayed behind with Harry Houndstooth and Sergei Snipe while Lulu Laverne went back with Captain Kiddo and Simon Bones was taken home by his owner.

	Kitty walked out of the gate with Kitty Pawsky still on her back, who was a good detective.Kitty Pawsky had very keen eyes and could pick up tiny details that most dogs couldn’t even see. They had been together for so long that they knew exactly what the other was thinking.

	Kitty and Kitty Pawsky began their walk to the park and then around it, checking every dog they saw until they were satisfied that nobody was hiding away as part of the investigation. They had been around twice when Kitty noticed something on a path she had never seen before. There were bits of paper spread all over the floor and it looked like someone had stepped in some cat food as well as other things like breadcrumbs. It looked like somebody had been looking for information or clues with the cat food but Kitty didn’t understand what had happened because it was such a small amount of it. Kitty knew that she would have to look deeper into things in order to get any more information out of these clues.

	When they walked passed the path with the mystery paper trail, Kitty bent down to see if she could spot anything that might give her any information but there wasn’t much there apart from some feathers and a few other small things like cigarette butts and other things that might have been dropped accidentally by the previous owner of the trail.

	Kitty felt sure that there must be something else she could find on her next walk because whoever left this trail had come back to look for it again.

	Kitty started walking around the trail in order to try and find some more bits of paper because there was obviously something important about them. She looked under every rock and behind every bush in case there were more pieces of the puzzle hidden away. Kitty’s plan worked though when she found a little piece of paper with paw prints on it near one of the trees. There was only one person who would have been walking their dog in this trail and that was Simon Bones, Harry Houndstooth’s owner. Kitty knew that he would talk to her about what had happened so she decided to speak to him next.

	Simon Bones wasn’t hard to find because he was one of the largest dogs in the park and everybody knew who he was. He would be easy to find because his owner had left a piece of paper which would lead her straight to him. When Kitty found Simon he was resting in one of his favorite spots. It was under a large tree where he liked to hide away from everybody else and think about all the problems he had. He was lying on hisback with his head resting on a big branch. His long white beard was spread out around him and his bright red eyes were closed.

	“Hello there Simon,” Kitty said when she found him, “I just wanted to have a quick chat with you because I am trying to solve a mystery and I don’t know what else to do.”

	Simon Bones looked up from the branch without opening his eyes and asked, “What is it that is causing so many problems?”

	Kitty went over to Simon and sat down beside him. She rubbed against him and said, “There’s been a series of dog-nappings in this park and Kitty Pawsky has been asked to help her friend solve them. Do you have any idea how we can make progress?”

	Simon Bones shook his head and replied, “I have not heard about any of the dog-nappings but it sounds as though they could be dangerous. I am sorry that I cannot help you with your investigation but I just wanted to tell you that.”

	Kitty gave Simon a friendly pat and thanked him for listening to her anyway before she left the park. She felt sure",1
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"The next morning Anna Cooper wakes up early to start her new job as a school janitor. She has been hired for the position because she is fast and efficient with her cleaning duties, and she is always willing to go above and beyond what is expected of her. She arrives at the school before the other students arrive, so she has time to clean the classrooms before they arrive.

   Anna is excited about her new job and plans to do it well so that she can be considered for more jobs in the future. As she cleans a classroom, her niece Maryanne arrives at the school. Maryanne is an excellent student who has always done well in school, and everyone expects great things from her in the future.

   When Maryanne sees her aunt sweeping up, she asks if she can help out and get some experience by helping her during her work day. Anna is glad to have help at this point because Maryanne is not an experienced cleaner. The two of them sweep up the classroom until it is time for the other students to arrive. Once they have cleaned all the rooms, they leave for a late lunch.

   When they come back to the school after lunch, they see that everything looks good and ready for the students. Annathen reminds Maryanne that she has to go home before curfew. She tells Maryanne that she cannot watch her work, but Maryanne says that she would be willing to stay.

   As the day progresses, Anna works hard and cleans all the classrooms efficiently. One of the teachers, Miss Miller, notices and compliments her work ethic. When Anna says that she likes her job because it is easy work and she wants to get more cleaning jobs in the future, Miss Miller asks if she would like a job as a teacher when she graduates from high school. Anna declines, saying that teaching is not for her. Miss Miller acknowledges this and suggests that Anna might want to consider being a counselor instead, since she seems to be good with children.

   The next day at work is similar to the first - fast-paced cleaning, quick lunch and back to work before the students arrive. The only major difference is that Anna notices that some of the students are getting a bit too friendly with their teachers. She does not say anything because she does not want to gossip or cause trouble, but she is bothered by what she sees, so she goes home early and does not tell her husband about it.

   On Saturday morning, Anna wakes up early to go backto her cleaning job. She has a new list of things to do, including cleaning the hallways. As she cleans, several of the students walk out of their classes and pass by her, making fun of her appearance and laughing at her clothes. She is used to this kind of treatment from some of the students and does not react too much to it, but a few minutes later when Anna hears Maryanne say that she is going to visit a friend, she feels scared and alone. She wonders how long Maryanne has been talking about this friend and if anyone will notice or care if something happens to Anna while she is alone. Anna decides that it would be best for Maryanne to stay with her, so she asks Maryanne if she wants to help her clean the hallways and put the chairs away in the auditorium. Maryanne happily agrees and they spend the rest of the day together.

   When Anna shows up for work on Monday morning, Miss Miller informs her that she is no longer needed at the school. She offers Anna a letter of recommendation if the young woman needs one; however, this means that Maryanne will have nothing to do during her lunch hour, so Miss Miller suggests that Maryanne stay with her. Once again, Anna reluctantly agreesto let Maryanne stay with her during her lunch hour. All morning, the two women work in silence. They do not speak to each other and they avoid eye contact. At the end of the day, Anna is given a letter of recommendation by Miss Miller and she tells the principal that she will not be returning to work at the school.

   After being fired from her job, Anna decides that she needs to figure out why Maryanne is so interested in seeing her aunt every day. So, the next day during lunchtime, she goes over to Maryanne where she finds Maryanne smiling and laughing in a car with another student named Tommy Washington. The two students tell Anna that they are going to meet at Maryanne’s aunt’s house and then they drive off. Anna thinks back to the previous day when she had noticed a man talking with Maryanne’s aunt. She wonders if her suspicions are true—that Maryanne is being molested by her teacher—but she does not know what to do or how to go about telling the police about it.

   That night, while Anna is cleaning the restroom at the school, Daniel Cooper comes into the room and tells her that he has an important meeting in the morning thatrequires him to do some research for work. Anna asks if she should come with him, but he says no and leaves the room. When Daniel returns home that night, he finds Anna waiting for him. He can tell from her expression that something is wrong and she tells him about Maryanne’s strange behavior. Daniel is shocked by what Anna has told him, but he does not want to get involved with the matter because Maryanne is Lily’s little sister and he feels like it would be inappropriate to get involved in this situation. So, they go to bed without deciding what they should do about Maryanne’s situation, but Anna still feels a great sense of guilt and anxiety about what she should do.

   The next day at school, people have been gossiping about what happened with Anna and Miss Miller. Some people think that Anna deserves to be fired for trying to cause trouble. Others think that it may not be a good idea to fire Anna because she might end up telling some of the teachers about the secrets they have been keeping at the school. As a result of her work as a janitor, Anna knows some terrible things about the people that work in the school. She is aware of how many of them are doing drugs and",1
Shannon and Brad Barton's marriage is on the rocks due to Brad's infidelity.,"A few months earlier

Shannon Barton was driving home from her job at the college library. She had spent most of the day working on a special project for her boss, and the last thing she wanted to do was go home to Brad. She should have known that he would be there when she came home, but she had hoped that he would have gone out drinking with his friends.
Brad had been calling Shannon all night, and she had been ignoring his calls until finally giving in and picking up. At this point in her marriage, she dreaded the possibility of Brad calling her. She knew that it was only going to be about sex, which was the only way that Brad could communicate with her.  Over the past few months, he had become more and more aggressive towards her sexually, and every time he touched her for the sake of pleasure, she felt degraded. She was at the end of her marriage and wanted nothing more than to leave him.
She walked into their bedroom suite to find Brad sitting on the edge of the bed looking at himself in the full-length mirror. He had his shirt off and looked well-groomed, including the carefully gelled hair on his head.Shannon knew that Brad was trying to look like he was sexy and desirable. He was hoping that she would want to have sex with him, but Shannon just walked into the bedroom without saying a word and stood silently in the doorway. She didn’t even look at Brad as she walked over to her dresser and started getting undressed.
Brad finally noticed Shannon’s presence and said, “Hey Honey! It’s about time you got home! We have got something special planned for tonight, so get a move-on!”
Shannon just frowned at Brad and grabbed her underwear out of the drawer and put them on without saying a word. She had no idea what Brad was talking about when he said they had something special planned, but she was sure it wasn’t anything good.  Shannon turned to face Brad and said, “Brad Barton you are not going to get anything from me tonight! I am done being your nympho slut!”
Brad just laughed out loud and said, “That is so cute!  You really think that you can stop me from getting what I want? You have no power to say no to me anymore.”Shannon just scoffed and said, “Just because I haven’t tried to stop you before doesn’t mean that I can’t do it now! Not another touch, not another kiss or lick from here on out!” Brad didn’t like the way things were going at all. He could tell that Shannon was done with him for good, so he thought it might be time for a little bit of emotional manipulation. Brad said, “That is funny Honey! I know what you really mean when you talk like that! You are just trying to act like a big man instead of showing how much you really love me.” Shannon just rolled her eyes at Brad and said, “No I am not! Like I told you before, if we are going to have a relationship then you need to start treating me right! It looks like you haven’t been able to do that for a while. So goodbye Brad Barton!” Shannon wasn’t afraid of Brad at all. She knew that there was no way he could ever overpower her in a fight or even win an argument against her. He had made his bed and now he would have to lay init. Shannon turned away from Brad and went back into their bedroom to get dressed without paying any attention to him at all.

After Shannon left the room Brad stood up from the bed and walked over to the full-length mirror on the back of his closet door. He looked into the mirror and saw how good he looked with his shirt off and his gel slicked-back hairstyle. Brad decided that it was time to call off his affair, but he wasn’t going to tell Karen Spooner right away. He didn’t want her to get suspicious about something if she seemed like she wanted to spend time with him less than usual. After making up his mind, Brad left the room and went downstairs to eat lunch with his in-laws before they went back out on the mountain to ski for a while.

Shannon’s mother-in-law, Dan Barton, came down from upstairs as soon as the front door closed behind Brad. Dan asked him if Shannon was coming too, but Brad told her that they were having some problems and that Shannon needed some time alone to calm down. Dan looked at Brad for a minute and asked him what was going on between them. Brad told Dan that he didn’t wantto talk about it at the moment and that it would be better if they just got out of there for a little while.

Dan Barton was shocked by Brad’s response because she had never seen the usually-cheerful Brad act so serious before. Dan decided to let their conversation drop then. She didn’t like it when people talked about their personal lives at family get-togethers anyway. She always saw those events as a time when the family could escape from all of their stress and just have a good time together.

A little while later, Brad finished eating the lunch that his mother-in-law had prepared for him and washed his hands at the sink before putting on his ski gear. He figured that maybe he should wait until they got back from skiing to tell Karen Spooner about their relationship. Brad didn’t want to ruin the rest of his weekend if she decided to get mad at him or break off their affair all together.

On the other hand, Karen Spooner was sitting in her house in her robe and slippers while she wrote a very long letter to her husband. Karen was planning on telling him about the affair when she got back from skiing this afternoon. She figured that it would take a",1
"When Natalie arrives at the address Trevor gave her, she quickly realizes that something isn't right and that Trevor might be a dangerous man .","now that they were in the same room together. Natalie Harper took a sip of her wine and smiled at Trevor Lockwood for a few seconds before answering his question. She told him that she had some ideas and he nodded his head at her.

Natalie Harper told Trevor Lockwood that she wanted to undress him, and kiss his body as he did the same to her. To add a little more excitement to the situation, she told Trevor Lockwood that they could include some foreplay with their clothes on as well.

Trevor Lockwood was flattered by Natalie Harper’s forward reply and he moved closer to her on the couch. He moved his hand up the inside of Natalie Harper’s thigh and touched her crotch several times before stopping.

Natalie Harper leaned in to kiss Trevor Lockwood, but he pulled away from her instead. He explained to Natalie Harper that he still had some questions to ask her before moving forward with their plan.

Trevor Lockwood moved his hand up Natalie Harper’s skirt and he felt her underwear. He moved his fingers back and forth several times before stopping to talk again.

Natalie Harper was now moving her head back and forth to keep eye contact with Trevor Lockwood. She moved her legs into a more open position so that Trevor Lockwood could have easier access to her panties. She wanted him to move his hand inside of them, but she was going to have to wait a few more minutes before he did.

Trevor Lockwood moved his other hand up Natalie Harper’s stomach and he gently massaged her breasts through her top. He moved his fingers in a small circular pattern before stopping to talk again.

There was a small white hotel in the middle of nowhere about an hour from Trevor Lockwood’s small town, a hotel where no one ever went anymore. It would be the perfect place for them to stay in order to get everything they needed done on time.

Trevor Lockwood moved his hands down from Natalie Harper’s breasts and started unbuttoning her shirt. He pushed the small cotton fabric aside and moved his hands underneath of them to touch her bare breasts.

Natalie Harper was moving completely out of her comfort zone by agreeing to an in-person meeting with Trevor Lockwood. She was moving further out of it as he moved his hands all over her body, especially when she  could feel his hard cock against her crotch through their clothes.

Trevor Lockwood touched the soft skin without restraint and Natalie Harper held her breath as he squeezed her large breasts in his hands. He then moved his lips to the area above one of them and kissed the tender skin there.

Natalie Harper was already feeling turned on by Trevor Lockwood and she knew that when he felt her bare breasts, his arousal would increase. She was a little surprised at how turned on she was herself, considering how nervous she felt as Trevor Lockwood was undressing her. 

Trevor Lockwood parted Natalie Harper’s thighs with his hands as he began to suck on one of her large breasts. After a few seconds, Natalie felt him move closer to her and she knew what was coming next.

The part of Natalie Harper that was not turned on by this situation was kicking in as Trevor Lockwood spread her legs and buried his face between them. Natalie began to feel a little nervous about the situation. She had never let anyone do that before, not even herself.

Trevor Lockwood began to kiss the soft skin of Natalie Harper’s inner thighs and she felt her knees grow weak as he licked the area between her legs. Natalie Harper felt her nerves give way to desire as Trevor Lockwood touched her most intimate areas. She began to think about what he was doing and why, and she felt a little uncomfortable that she was so turned on by it all. Trevor Lock wood found this amusing and continued to lick Natalie Harper’s pussy.

Natalie Harper was beginning to panic as she thought about what Trevor Lockwood was doing between her legs. He had not even touched her pussy yet and she could already feel the strong sensations emanating from it. It occurred to Natalie that Trevor Lockwood might have done this before and that he might be very good at it. Natalie Harper grew more and more nervous as the minutes passed, but she could only focus on what was happening to her body.

Natalie Harper felt as if she were going crazy. She wanted to stop what was happening, but  her body told her otherwise. She knew that it was “wrong” to let a stranger do this to her and she knew that she should get up and leave, but something inside of her would not allow her to do so.

She didn’t hear from Trevor after that, and Natalie began",1
"Jack goes through the motions of living, but he can't see any purpose in it without her.","he knew was that his wife had betrayed him and that he shouldn’t have been surprised by it. He also knew that there wasn’t anything more to be done about it, and that she would probably never come back to him now.

He had tried calling her on the phone a few times since they got home, but she hadn’t answered any of his calls. Eliza didn’t want to talk to him right now, and there was nothing he could do about it. Adam didn't want to talk to him either, but that wasn't so surprising because Adam was Eliza's lover.

About ten minutes later, he sat down on the couch and stared at the photograph again. Now Jack had more questions than he had when he first saw it. One of them was, “How long have they been seeing each other?” He didn’t know if she had started having an affair with Adam after their daughter was born or not. Maybe it had even been going on before then.

   He tried to imagine what she should have done differently, and all he could think of was that she should have kept her love for him as strong as ever, but she obviously hadn’t done that. How could someone stay in love with someone else while they were married?  And even if she had beenable to do it, why would she have the need to see other men while she was married?

   Jack couldn’t even imagine that happening. He would never want to be with anyone else but her, no matter what happened between the two of them. He realized that there was a possibility that Eliza felt the same way, but her actions indicated otherwise.

   After fifteen minutes passed he got up and went over to his desk, where he picked up a sheet of paper and wrote something down. Then he turned around and looked at the picture again for inspiration before he rewrote the message from Eliza on the note. After staring at it for a minute, he stuck it on the table next to the picture and then left his apartment.

   When Jack arrived at the hospital to pick up his daughter, he found her in the children’s ward with Adam Wilson, who was holding her in his arms while she slept.

Adam turned around as soon as Jack came into the room and said, “Hello there.”

“Hello,” Jack replied while staring at Adam. He thought that it was strange that Eliza would leave their daughter with Adam when she knew that Jack might come topick her up.

   “How have you been since the last time I saw you?” Adam asked while he gently stroked Abbie’s hair.

“Not good,” Jack answered while he tried to keep his gaze on the floor instead of looking at Eliza’s lover. “I don’t know how I can cope with not having her here anymore. She was everything to me, and now I don’t know what I am supposed to do with myself or how to live without her.”

“You should get some help with that,” Adam said while he continued to look at Jack. “There are people out there who can help you heal and move on with your life. Have you talked to anyone about what happened?”

“No, I haven’t had time for that and I don’t know if I want anyone else but her helping me through this, even though it would be easier if someone else were. I guess I should have done that a long time ago, but I wanted to wait until Eliza got back from vacation so she could help me through this.”“I know it’s hard. I wish there was something I could say to make it all better. I can see how much pain you are in and I’m sorry that you are going through this. Please know that if there is anything you need, just let me know.”

Adam stood up and offered his hand to Jack. Jack was touched by Adam’s kindness and gave him a firm handshake before he headed towards the door with his daughter in his arms.

“I hope that nothing ever happens to you, Jack Barlow, because I don’t think that Eliza will take it well if you leave her alone forever.”

Jack smiled at Adam and nodded his head in thanks before he walked out of the room with Abbie now in his arms. He was so full of grief that he could hardly stand up straight and had to focus on not falling over because he felt like he was going to pass out at any moment. He took some deep breaths and tried to talk to himself in order to calm down, but nothing seemed to work and he continued walking towards the elevator until he was finally able to control his breathing again.He stood in the elevator for a moment, fighting back tears and trying to focus on his little girl.

	The doors opened and he walked out of the hospital and back onto the sidewalk. It was a beautiful day outside with light blue skies and puffy clouds floating by. Jack looked up at the sky as he crossed one of the streets on his way home. The sun was warm against his face and he enjoyed having it shine on him after being inside for so long. He had not realized how much time had passed, but by the time he got home it was already dark outside. He opened the door to his house quietly so as not to wake Abbie who was sleeping in her room.

He slipped off his shoes and made sure that she was covered with a blanket before he turned off the light beside her bed. He sat down in an armchair next to her bed and looked down at her peaceful face for a moment, almost feeling guilty for being happy that she was asleep because he knew that she would wake up happy in the morning while he would still be miserable. He gave her a kiss on the forehead and moved the chair closer to the bed before leaning back into it and closing his eyes so that all he could see is Abbie’s",0
The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,"while pointing over at Julia’s doorway with trembling hands.
	Thelma was shouting, “It’s coming for you, Julia! It’s coming for you!”

	Julia walked into Thelma Bates’ bedroom and sat down on the edge of her bed. It wasn’t like she could do anything to help her grandmother. If there was a monster in the house then there was probably nothing that Julia could do to stop it.
	But before she had time to think about what Thelma was saying, Julia saw something moving by her doorway. It looked like a shadow that seemed to be moving very quickly toward the hall closet and then disappeared into it. As soon as the shadow disappeared, Julia rushed out of the room and headed upstairs to her own bedroom.

	Julia made it up to her room without running into anything else odd, but she still wasn’t completely convinced that there was a monster living in the house with them. In fact, Julia knew that it could have been something else altogether. Julia thought about the first time that she had seen the dark figure standing by her doorway and how she thought that it might have been a shadow until it started moving toward her. But that was only an assumption; there had been no way for Julia to know for sure what she saw at the time. So there was a possibility that it wasn’t actually a monster at all.

	Julia went to her bed and fell asleep, hoping that she would be able to get some of the images out of her head.

	During the morning hours, Julia woke up several times but was still unable to go back to sleep because of the vivid images that kept running through her mind. But Julia was having more trouble with the visions than just being unable to get back to sleep. She was also starting to see things in other places as well.
	The last thing that Julia remembered seeing before she felt herself being pulled into another dream-like state was Joe Wheeler’s face.
	There wasn’t anything special about seeing Joe; he came over to the house often enough for Julia to know what he looked like. But somehow, even though she couldn’t remember what had happened during her vision, Julia knew that something bad was going to happen to Joe.

	Julia could hear Thelma yelling from downstairs, but the words didn’t make much sense to Julia. All of a suddenshe could feel herself being pulled away from the house and into a dark tunnel. Julia tried to resist, but the further she was pulled into her vision, the less control she had over her movements. She realized that it was no use; she would either have to let herself be pulled into whatever dream-like state she was in or allow herself to wake up.

	In the next instant, Julia found herself back in bed and covered by a thin sheet with no recollection of what had happened in between. The first thing that came to her mind when she opened her eyes was that she must have slept through the alarm and overslept for work. She quickly jumped out of bed and started to go into the bathroom. But Julia stopped when she noticed that there was someone standing there in front of the mirror. She knew it wasn’t Thelma Bates because Julia knew that her grandmother always got up at six o’clock every morning and got ready for the day before coming downstairs to eat breakfast.
	Julia turned around and noticed that it was Karen Jones who was standing there, staring at Julie with an expression on her face that Julie had never seen on Karen’s face before. Almost as soon as she saw Karen in the bathroom, Juliapushed past her and into the shower without another thought about what was going on or why it was happening to her.

	It wasn’t until after she had finished getting dressed and gone out to the kitchen that she realized what had happened. Julia remembered seeing Karen in the bathroom, but she also remembered her not being there anymore. At first, she thought that maybe she had imagined it. Maybe a small part of her mind tried to convince her that it couldn’t have happened because there was no possible explanation for what she saw. But Julia couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something very weird going on.
	The urge to ignore it won out, and Julia made her way down the stairs and into Thelma’s room. Her grandmother was still sleeping soundly in bed so Julia went into her own room and sat down at the dining table to have a quiet cup of coffee. As she took a sip of her drink, Julia heard what sounded like someone walking across the floor above her.

	Julia went down the staircase and into Thelma’s room again, just to be sure that she hadn’t imagined it. As soon as Julia entered the room, she noticed that something was wrong withThelma’s wheelchair. It wasn’t in its usual position, propped against the far wall near Thelma’s bed. Instead, it was sitting in the middle of the room and one of the wheels had been deliberately bent and destroyed.

	Julia didn’t hesitate; she immediately called Karen on her cell phone and asked if she had been to Thelma’s room earlier in the morning. Karen said no, but Julia knew that there was a big chance that she was lying about being somewhere else when the crime was committed. There were other people living in the house as well, so there was no reason for Julia to think that everyone who lived in her grandmother’s home on the hill could have been responsible for what happened in the basement.

	Julia hung up the phone and quickly returned to her room to retrieve her car keys. She wanted to go back home and look through some of her grandfather’s old books because she suspected that there might have been more information about what was happening to her in them than what she got from local doctors.

	As Julia walked down towards the car, she suddenly had a vision of herself walking through the forest and ending up in a dark while pointing over at Julia’s doorway with trembling hands.

Julia Martin starts to experience terrifying visions.,"Julia Martin has always been curious.

	She is an artist, painting in a style that is both abstract and realistic. Some of her paintings are ethereal, with bright colors in strange shapes that don’t seem to make sense. Other of her paintings are realistic, depicting actual scenes and objects. Julia paints the people she sees on the streets during her walks home from school one block away from her house, or the plants she sees hanging from trees along the way. But Julia always paints herself into her paintings; she rarely depicts herself as a child, but more often as an adult woman.
	And to add to her curiosity, Julia has never known a day of her life without suffering from seizures. At first they were simple, and took place so often that she stopped paying attention to them altogether. But then her seizures started becoming more frequent and more intense, until just a couple of months ago she began experiencing them every single day.

	Julia’s seizures also affect her creativity; often, after experiencing a seizure, Julia will not be able to paint for at least a week. She has even been in and out of hospital care because of the severity of her seizures. Her doctors have told her that there is very little hope infinding any sort of cure for her condition, and that they can only offer her pain management when she is having a seizure.
	But the worst part about Julia’s condition is not the pain or the disability. The worst part of all is that it’s making Julia go crazy.

	Julia has been suffering from seizures since she was just a child, but everything changed when she went to college.

	She had always been a social person, but something about the students at her college just didn’t connect with her. She tried to make friends, but every time she did things seemed to go terribly wrong. She suffered from constant ridicule by other students, who sometimes used their words to bully her, and sometimes used physical force. Once they even made a video of themselves throwing food at her while she was having a seizure.

	The night that the video was made Julia had just gotten home from college feeling awful about herself. She hadn’t been able to paint since her last seizure, and she had no idea what was going on with her artwork. It felt like all of the beauty from her paintings had disappeared, and they had become dull and lifeless.

	She began to think that this was why she was havingseizures. That the seizure itself was affecting her artwork, and making it less beautiful.

	Julia knew that something terrible was happening to her, but she didn’t know how to stop it or what to do about it.

	Suddenly, Julia started having a severe seizure. Her entire body began to shake, and she fell face first onto her bed. The whole world went black for a few minutes as her body continued shaking and convulsing uncontrollably. Julia was afraid that something terrible would happen to her at this moment. Who knows what damage could be done to an epileptic person while they were convulsing on their bed?

	When Julia came to, she opened her eyes and looked around the room. The world was still black, but she could see shapes moving in front of her. She thought it sounded like someone was trying to talk to her, but she couldn’t hear anything. Then, suddenly, the shadows came together and formed a being. A creature with a black face and white eyes. The creature made an inhuman sound as it looked down at Julia while she laid on the bed convulsing. The monster reached down and grabbed Julia by the throat, lifting her up off of the bed. The monster started screamingas it began to drag her across the room in the dark.

	Julia wasn’t sure what was happening, but she knew that it was something terrible. All she could do now is pray that someone would come save her from this monstrous nightmare.

	Suddenly, everything went back to normal. Julia was left lying on the bed still having a seizure. It took another few seconds for Julia to come back from the shock of what just happened. She looked around expecting to see someone standing over her with a worried look on their face. But there was no one there. She was alone on her dark bedroom floor still convulsing uncontrollably.

	After another minute or so of shaking, Julia’s body finally calmed down. When she knew that she was done convulsing, she sat up on the floor and tried to catch her breath. She felt like there were needles stuck in her throat making it hard for her to breath. Her whole body ached from the recent seizure, and she had trouble getting herself off of the floor. It was even hard for Julia to speak, but she managed to say “No more” out loud.

	For Julia, this was just the most recent in a series of seizures that hadplagued her since she was a little girl. But this time was different from all the other times. She knew that whatever just happened had to do with what she saw in her vision.

	Julia got up on her feet and headed toward the other end of the hallway. She wanted to get away from the dark bedroom and take a look out each of her windows hoping for some kind of sign that someone was going to save her, but there was nothing out there except for darkness. So instead, Julia decided to take a shower so that she could at least feel clean again.

	When Julia came back downstairs and walked into the kitchen, she decided to walk by Thelma Bates’ room before going upstairs to her own room. As she was walking by Thelma’s door, there was a loud scream coming from inside the room. For a moment, Julia thought that Thelma Bates had just started having another major stroke.
	But then, Julia heard the sound of one of her grandmother’s medicine cups falling to the floor behind her bedroom door. When Julia turned around and looked at Thelma’s room, she saw her grandmother sitting in her wheelchair rocking back and forth. Thelma was crying hysterically Julia Martin has always been curious.

"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","Jenna Riley stood in the doorway of her family’s blue bungalow, sipping on a cold glass of milk. The air was warm and humid, and Jenna felt heavy in the muggy heat. She had worked the midnight shift at the diner all night long, and it was now four in the morning. Jenna was exhausted from working, and she wished that she could go home to her apartment soon. She passed a few other people on the sidewalk on her way home. They all wore clothes that were too warm for how humid it was outside that early in the morning. Jenna stopped to chat with one of her coworkers. Jenna wished that she worked during the day shift, like him. It would be easier on her body and easier for her to do errands during the day, rather than at night. She would have to wait until after ten thirty before she could go home and rest. She had time for a quick nap  before she had to leave for work again.

Jenna was carrying a big brown bag of books in one hand and her keys in the other as she walked down the street. She stopped to look at a flyer about a community event. As she was looking through the pages, someone grabbed her shoulder and spun her around behind her. The mugger pressed his hand over her mouth and pulled out a gun.

“Do anything stupid,” he warned, “and I’ll shoot you in the head and leave you in this alley, just like your friend.”

He was talking about the poor girl who had been found murdered in the alley behind the diner a few weeks ago. Jenna had often walked through that same alley on her way home from work. She wished that she hadn’t been too tired this morning to walk a different route.

Jenna tried to scream, but the mugger clamped his hand tighter over her mouth. When he let go of her shoulder, Jenna took advantage and ran for the doors of the library across the street. There were several people inside, working on their laptops or sitting in cozy chairs reading magazines.

“Help!” Jenna shouted, but the people either looked up from their work or kept reading. No one bothered to come out and help her.

The mugger ran up to her, grabbed at the bag of books she was holding, and screamed, “Give me your stupid books! Now!”

Jenna dropped the plastic-wrapped books, but the mugger tripped on his own feet, allowing Jenna to escape. As he stood up, he pulled out a gun and pointed it at Jenna.

Jenna knew that she couldn’t outrun him.

“Get over here or I’ll blow your brains out,” the mugger barked.

Jenna stepped closer to the man, giving him no other choice but to pull the trigger. When a shot rang out, Jenna instinctively ducked and found herself on the ground. It felt like her cheek was burning, but she couldn’t be sure.

The mugger laughed and knelt down next to her. “You made it easy for me, bitch,” he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette lighter. He looked down at Jenna  and smiled. “When I’m done with you, you won’t be able to walk home from your shift at the diner anymore.”

The mugger stood up and ignited the lighter. Jenna closed her eyes and felt a sharp pain in her face as the mugger pressed the hot end of the lighter against Jenna’s cheek. She heard a sizzle and when she opened her eyes, she saw the mugger staring at her.

Jenna sat up and coughed, blood spewing out of her mouth. She looked around and saw the mugger lighting another cigarette;  he was still sitting on the ground next to her. Jenna screamed as loud as she could and lunged forward at the mugger, knocking him off balance. The mugger fell backwards and screamed in pain as he fell onto some broken glass.

Jenna stood up, but was too weak to get very far. She stumbled to the other side of the alley and collapsed against a wall. She looked down at her hands and saw that they were covered in blood. Her shirt was also stained with blood, and she could feel it slowly seeping into her jeans.

The mugger got back to his feet and turned around; he was holding the lighter as if preparing for another attack. Jenna’s vision started to go dark, and she stumbled forward, trying to reach the diner. She reached her arms out as if to brace herself against the wall, but all she hit were cold bricks.

Jenna then felt a sharp sting in her side; she looked down and saw that she was bleeding profusely. She slowly sank to the ground, and began coughing up more blood. The mugger walked out of the alley after he saw that Jenna was lying motionless on the ground. He picked up his sunglasses from the ground and put them back on his face.

Jenna suddenly came to, and forced herself onto her knees. She heard sirens just outside the alley, and tried to crawl in the direction of the diner’s entrance. It was hard going, but she managed to make it to the door. She was about to use her hands to open it when she realized that her hand was completely covered in blood.

She then heard a voice, “It’s okay, just lean on me.” When she looked up, Damian Henchman was helping Jenna out behind the diner. Jenna coughed and spat out some blood onto the ground. She began coughing again, and then collapsed on the ground.

Jenna came to again, and this time, she found herself in a white-walled hospital room with a man in his mid twenties standing at her bedside. Jenna looked up at him, and noticed that he had long blond hair and blue eyes. His face was covered with deep, red scars. He wore a white shirt and pants that were tucked into black combat boots. He was holding Jenna’s hand, and stared back at her.",1
"John Doe, the serial killer, tells Valerie that she must escape the basement before dawn or else she will become his next trophy.","became aware, then, that there was something sticky on her mouth, and a gag holding it shut from behind. She moved a hand to grab it with both hands, trying to pull it off… and found that it would not budge. She tugged at it furiously for a few moments, until she felt exhaustion setting in. The high-pitched whine of frustration died away into despairing silence as the last bit of energy left her body.All she could do now was wait and wonder what this place was; to fear what might happen next. What had happened before?

Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"<br><br>""I can't do it,"" said Anna. Her voice was shaky and hollow. ""I'm not going to do this.""<br><br>Mike stood in front of her, his face contorted with anger. ""Anna, you signed a contract. You promised me that you would take this job.""<br><br>The two were in Anna's small apartment behind the school where she worked as a janitor. It had been ten minutes since Mike had stormed into the room. Up until he arrived, Anna had been packing her belongings, getting ready to leave her job as a janitor at an exclusive school in Brooklyn Heights and travel back home to California for good. She hadn't exactly planned on leaving just yet, but when Mike had told her about the new janitor that he'd hired for her position, she'd realized immediately that there was no point in staying any longer. She'd always loved New York City and this particular job, but she knew that it wasn't meant to be hers forever; it was time for something else to happen in her life now. But what? She'd never seen herself as a janitor: that wasn't who she was or who she wanted to be. Unfortunately, though, it seemed like what Mike wanted from her now was just that.<br><br>""You need to calm down,"" she said calmly. She was trying to keep her cool despite how scary Mike could be when he got angry. ""You're not making sense right now.""<br><br>""I'm not making sense? You're the one who's not making sense! You promised me that you'd work at this school as a janitor for as long as I needed you, and now you're saying that you're going to quit? I just don't understand! What is so bad about this school, Anna?! What have I done to make you hate it?""<br><br>""I don't hate it,"" said Anna quickly. ""I can't stand it anymore, okay? It's been six months since I've started working here, and nothing has changed. There's no way that anyone would start something like this just so they can keep it up for years at a time without any intention of ending it sooner.""<br><br>""But of course there are things on the books that have to take time before they can be fulfilled,"" said Mike quickly, his head shaking back and forth in disbelief. ""That's why this is such an opportunity for others like us; after all, we've had the benefit of years of careful planning.""<br><br>""What do you mean?"" asked Anna.<br><br>Mike looked like he was about to drop another bomb on her. ""Anna, look around you! We're standing in an office. This is where I meet with other coworkers every day to discuss our progress and what to do next.""<br><br>Anna looked around the room even as she pulled her eyes away from Mike's face. She wasn't sure if she wanted to see what he was showing her or not, but all of his talk about coworkers had made her curious; after all, she'd found nothing of the sort on this floor when she'd cleaned it before he came in and started talking about making a group of workers at his company or something. ""I don't see any-"" she started to say, but that was all that came out before she caught sight of something on the wall. It wasn't anything big: just a blackboard with some scribbles written on it. But as soon as her eyes landed on it, Anna's jaw dropped open in surprise and shock. What were those words? They didn't seem like they were written by anyone who worked at the school; they seemed...like something else entirely...something much more sinister...<br><br>""It's been part of my plan all along,"" Mike told her. Anna could tell that he was getting agitated, but she didn't care. She was afraid to look at him, afraid of the anger in his eyes; he might have been a good-looking man for his age, but the truth about him was that he had a cold and dark soul. ""I've been planning this for months.""<br><br>""You've been planning it?"" asked Anna, her voice so high in pitch that she almost didn't recognize it. ""What are you going to do? Tell me!""<br><br>""I'm not going to tell you,"" said Mike with a sneer. ""At least not right now. But I will say this: don't put too much into those scribbles on that blackboard."" Anna followed his gaze and looked back at the words on the board again: they seemed familiar somehow, but then again they didn't...it was so hard to remember what she'd seen before this moment...<br><br>""Are you going to let me go soon?"" asked Anna as she glanced back at Mike's face and saw nothing but rage there now; he seemed angrier than ever before, his eyes wild as he walked around behind her desk with quick steps. ""Where are you going?""<br><br>""I've got to get back to the meeting,"" he said, checking the time on his sleek, high-tech watch. ""Remember this place and what you see here when you look around,"" he whispered as he came back around her desk and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. ""And think of your daughter. I know you have her tucked away somewhere safe and sound, but just in case she doesn't stay safe...""<br><br>""What?"" asked Anna as she pushed his arms away from her. ""What is that supposed to mean? Tell me!""<br><br>""It means what it means,"" said Mike; he was standing only a foot away from her now, one hand on her desk and the other leaning on a wall for support, but Anna couldn't help but notice how unhealthy he looked. He was covered in sweat, his eyes surrounded by dark circles that were so prominent that they even showed up through his make-up; something was definitely wrong with him...otherwise...why else would a man like him stand close enough for Anna to touch him? He'd already told her about why people like them were there; it didn't make any sense for him to act like this unless something had gone terribly wrong... ""I wish I",1
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"<br><br>Gabriel had a gas oven with two burners, so he could only bake one item at a time. He had to make sure that he left enough space between each item to be able to open the oven door and remove the finished dish without having to move any other dishes. He needed a lot of freezer space because he could only store a few items in his refrigerator at a time.<br><br>Gabriel had lived on his own before, so he knew how to cook simple meals. But now, Gabriel was living on his own for the first time, and he was learning how to cook more fancy dishes. He moved into his tiny apartment with a small kitchen, so he had to learn to get creative.<br><br>Gabriel was originally from a small town in Colorado, where there were many scenic hiking trails and biking routes. However, Gabriel was in the city now, where there were not many hiking or biking trails nearby. Gabriel liked going to the local park and jogging on the paved trails. Gabriel lived close to the beach, where he enjoyed hanging out at the boardwalk with his friends. Gabriel was doing all of these things to keep himself busy and stay active while he looked for a job.<br><br>Gabriel had a big social circle, since he attended college in a large city, where he met many people from all over the world. Gabriel stayed in touch with these people, and it was nice to have a support network of friends when moving to a new city. Gabriel had some family members who lived nearby. Gabriel moved closer to them so that they could take care of him if he ever needed anything.<br><br>Gabriel started looking for a job right away, but he had no luck at first. Gabriel was unsure what kind of job to be looking for because he did not have enough experience in any one field yet.  There was a period of time when Gabriel could not find a job. Gabriel did not like living off of his savings, but he had to use them until he could find a job. Gabriel’s parents wanted him to stay on their health insurance plan back home, since it was cheaper. Gabriel still paid rent and bills in the city where he lived. Gabriel did not want to fall behind in paying his bills.<br><br>Once Gabriel found a job, he earned enough money to pay his expenses easily without having to rely on his savings. Gabriel made enough money to visit the local bars and clubs with his friends, but he did not  go out as much as they did. Gabriel had a girlfriend now, and he wanted to spend more time with her instead of his other friends.<br><br>Gabriel started dating Lina Sanchez. He met her at one of the places where he had gone out with his friends in the past few weeks. Lina Sanchez was Gabriel’s friend’s ex-girlfriend, but she became his girlfriend after a while.<br><br>Lina Sanchez was Gabriel’s first girlfriend from a different culture. She was from Italy, and she studied creative writing at a local university in Denver. She came to America when she was nineteen years old. Gabriel met her when he was twenty years old.<br><br>Gabriel met her at a bar where Lina Sanchez used to go with her family. Her parents owned the restaurant, and they were there most of the time. They spoke Italian and English with their customers when they ate there. Gabriel met Lina Sanchez while he was out with his friends drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.<br><br>Gabriel met her because she was a beautiful girl. She had dark brown eyes, brunette hair, and olive skin. She had a slender body and long black hair that reached down to her waistline.  She always wore fashionable clothes, and she looked like a Hollywood actress.<br><br>They started to get closer after a few weeks. Gabriel walked her home one night, and they kissed each other in front of the restaurant while Lina Sanchez’s parents were watching. They did not do anything else that night, but they started to date after that. They went on many dates, and Gabriel met her parents after a few months.<br><br>Gabriel felt like he was dating an older woman from the beginning of their relationship because she was nineteen years old when they met, and Gabriel was only twenty years old when they started dating.  He thought that he acted more mature than she did, and he considered himself to be a more grown-up person than she was.<br><br>After almost two years together, they moved in together into a little apartment. They were officially boyfriend and girlfriend, but they still acted as if they were children living at home with their parents. When they moved into the apartment, Gabriel had a lot of stuff that he brought from his parents’ house. He also had some books and other items that he bought for his apartment. He had to rearrange all of them because there was not much space in the small room.<br><br>They went out many times during the next couple of weeks, and Gabriel’s friends were visiting the apartment often to meet his girlfriend. They started to talk about relationship problems when they were bored, so for a couple of hours Gabriel and Lina talked about their relationship issues. They seemed to work through some of them when they moved in together.<br><br>Gabriel felt that he needed to be more mature, and he thought that he was not ready for this kind of responsibility after only two years together with her. He was worried that they were growing apart, but he did not know how to express these feelings to her. <br><br>He did not feel like a grown-up yet. He continued to ask his parents for money now and then, even though he was twenty years old and had a steady job. He would not stop talking about his parents when they visited the apartment, even though he lived there for almost two months already. Gabriel felt that he was still a teenager, but his behavior did not help him feel like an independent man in a relationship with a young woman.<br><br>Gabriel started to feel that he was in love with Lina because she seemed to be the best thing that happened to him lately. She was better than his new apartment, and better than his new job, but Gabriel started to feel that this was not enough for a happy relationship. He wanted more; he wanted to feel responsible and independent.<br><br>Gabriel decided that he was going to talk about this issue with her. He felt guilty and afraid at the same time; it was not easy to face the idea that they might not be on the same page anymore.",1
Valerie uses her wits to escape the basement and evade John Doe.,"thing, and Valerie knew that there was no way for her to escape now.<br><br>“Valerie Marx,” he said to himself while waving a meat cleaver in her direction. “I think it’s time for you to die.”<br><br>Valerie stopped running when she saw John Doe, her only avenue of escape blocked off by the vicious murderer. She tried to run towards the nearest house, but John Doe began his slow and torturous approach towards her.<br><br>John Doe came closer and closer until he was standing right in front of Valerie. Valerie did not try to fight John Doe because she knew he could easily overpower her. She knew that John Doe was going to use his meat cleaver to chop off her head, and just as he swung the blade down towards her neck, she closed her eyes and prepared for death. <br><br>Valerie opened her eyes when she felt the meat cleaver swing down towards her neck, which meant that John Doe had not killed her yet. He was about to do so, but something made him stop, and he put the meat cleaver down on the ground, instead of killing Valerie.<br><br>Valerie got up from the ground, wiping the blood off her neck and looking at John Doe with an angry and hurt expression on her face. “Why’d you let me go?” she asked angrily. “I told you I wanted to end my life. You promised me that  if I escaped before sunrise you wouldn’t come after me. Why didn’t you keep your promise? Where is the man who was going to let me die in peace?”<br><br>At that moment, Valerie saw a knife on the floor, and she quickly picked it up and pointed it towards  her own throat, trying to scare John Doe into believing that she was going to kill herself right then and there. “Where is he?” she asked menacingly. “I don’t see him anywhere! He must be dead!”<br><br>John Doe was scared for a moment, but then he remembered that Valerie Marx was just an actress, and he knew that she wasn’t going to actually kill herself. Instead, John Doe would have killed her himself if she had actually done it, and then he would have spent the rest of his life in prison. Valerie Marx had used her acting skills to get him to let her go. He knew that she was pretending to be a suicidal person because he had told her that he would let her escape before sunrise if she did. John Doe knew that Valerie was bluffing because he didn’t think that she was  really going to kill herself just for the sake of getting away from him.<br><br>John Doe quickly tried to disarm Valerie by taking the knife out of her hand, but she had already pulled it away from her neck and was ready to attack him. For a brief moment, John Doe thought about trying to get Valerie into a headlock and controlling her with his legs. He had done that trick to five other women, and it always worked out well even when he couldn’t find a weapon. It was too late for John Doe to make a move though because Valerie Marx had already started running towards the door, and she made",1

Gabriel moves out of his parents' house and into his own apartment.,"<br><br>As Gabriel packed up his last box, he became acutely aware of the fact that he was moving out of the only home he had ever known. He moved to a quiet part of town, with leafy trees and grassy yards. It was a far cry from his parent's house in the city, but it would do for now.<br><br>Gabriel reached down to pick up one last box and placed it on top of the stack. He looked around his room and sighed. Part of him felt ready to move on, but another part of him felt afraid and heartbroken at leaving the only family he had ever known behind.<br><br>""It's time to go,"" Gabriel said as he slung his backpack over his shoulder.<br><br>Stepping outside into the bright sunlight was almost too much for him—like stepping into a hot shower blindfolded. The hazy sun blinded him as it reflected off the buildings around him, creating a kaleidoscope effect that almost made him sick with vertigo. He walked through the living room and out onto the patio that connected all of their units together like an apartment complex. His parents were there watching him leave again with an expressionless face as they stood on their own patio sipping orange juice and chatting.<br><br>""Have a good one,"" his father said as he turned to walk back inside.<br><br>Gabriel smiled, ""You too.""<br><br>As Gabriel left the patio, he passed his neighbor who was washing his car in the driveway. The neighbor was a man in his mid-to-late twenties who was about six-feet tall and had short blond hair and blue eyes. Gabriel couldn't remember much about him aside from the fact that he never smiled at anyone—even when people said hello to him. It made Gabriel wonder if there might be some sort of hard life that led him to be so standoffish. He thought about saying hello but knew it would sound forced so he just nodded and kept walking.<br><br>Gabriel walked down the steps behind their individual homes and back onto the sidewalk with his box in tow. He looked around at all of the other houses on this street and noticed how they were much larger than other houses in town and all seemed to have two or three garages compared to just one here on this street like most of the others had. This area seemed to cater more toward families rather than young singles who were just starting out like he was; which suited Gabriel fine, even if it did mean he would have to drive to get what he needed.<br><br>""Wouldn't it have been nice to have a garden?"" Gabriel thought as he looked up at the large houses with lawns in front of them. He imagined walking through the grass with his bare feet, feeling the cool grass between his toes and kicking up the blades as he walked through. ""I guess I'll take it when I get it,"" he said, trying to console himself as he walked down the street into town.<br><br>Gabriel made his way through town, taking less than a half hour to reach the outskirts where all of the new developments were happening. The area just south of town was full of new subdivisions with brand new homes that were already being occupied by families who wanted to be close enough to work and play but not so close that it would be too noisy for their kids or their animals. It was a strange thing for Gabriel because all his life, this had been nothing but trees and grassy areas that animals could roam free in—but now there was no room for wild animals because humans had taken over. It made Gabriel sad because part of him wished that things could become wild again like they had been before humans arrived on this planet, but another part of him was glad they made this place civilized.<br><br>Gabriel walked through the neighborhood, looking at all of the different houses and smiling at how beautiful they all were. He liked how the trees lined each side of the streets like an arbor, allowing him to walk under shade instead of under the blazing sun. It was like walking inside a movie set that looked just like actual old towns where people used to live before electricity and technology changed everything. Gabriel smiled at one house in particular that had a large white picket fence surrounding it with a small garden on either side of it filled with flowers and plants. He thought it looked so pretty with its bright red front door and cute shutters on each window.<br><br>""I really hope I can find a place that looks even half as nice as this one,"" Gabriel thought as he continued to walk toward his apartment building. ""Ah… I hope it's not too far away.""<br><br>As he walked past another home, this time on his left, he noticed something unusual—there was someone sitting in their driveway reading a book outside in broad daylight. In addition to that, there was also an African American woman sitting next to them who appeared to be watching them as well but didn't seem bothered by the fact that they were sitting in the sun without a shirt on. Gabriel frowned and wondered where the person's clothes were. ""Is that person okay?""<br><br>He continued to watch as the woman was still sitting there, reading her book. Gabriel squinted to see if she had clothes on underneath her bathrobe, but he couldn't tell for sure because she was sitting in a lawn chair and blocking his view from seeing her entire body. The person who was seated next to them appeared to be wearing pants but that was about it. Gabriel shook his head and continued looking up at the brick apartment complex that was now visible in front of him, trying not to stare at the people who he thought appeared strange but completely fascinating all at once. He could feel his mouth watering as he peered at his new residence which seemed so close now, feeling only a few more steps apart from being inside of it. ""Only three more houses and I'll be there,"" he said, stating out loud how close he felt he was from getting into his new home—and having his very own bathroom! ""I wonder what my apartment will look like,"" he mumbled excitedly when suddenly…<br><br>SMACK!<br><br>Gabriel felt a sharp sting hit him on the",0
Jenna Adams meets Brian Johnson and immediately feels drawn to him.,"<br><br>Jenna Adams, a woman who had never had a long-term relationship, was sitting across from her best friend, Lois. They were having lunch at their favorite restaurant overlooking the water.<br><br>“Lois,” Jenna said, “I have to tell you something and I hope you don’t think I’m crazy.”<br><br>“You always say that, but you never are. What is it?” Lois asked.<br><br>Jenna looked around the restaurant to see if anyone was listening in on their conversation. “I met someone last week and I think he might be…the one.” Jenna was nervous as she said this out loud for the first time to anyone other than herself.<br><br>Lois sat back in her chair and put her head in her hands for a few moments in surprise before speaking again. “You met someone? Like someone that you want more than sex? That you want to marry someday? Like someone that would become your partner forever and ever? You can do better than Brian Johnson! He's an asshole that only cares about himself! How could you possibly be interested in him? You'll end up getting hurt by him if you go out with him!”<br><br>“Lois, I know that you don't like him, but we're having dinner tonight. He seems really nice.”<br><br>Lois put her head in her hands again and took a long breath before speaking again. “Jenna, please be careful. Do not commit your heart to someone that is an asshole just so you can find love or something like that because it will come back to haunt you one day. You really deserve someone better than a man-child that only cares about himself and his image. Don't rush into this relationship; I know that you want real love but trust me when I tell you that he will break your heart if things between the two of you get serious. He's already done it once when he dumped his wife for slutty blonde bimbo Brittany over a year ago! Jenna, he's cheap, obnoxious and cruel to the people around him at times!”<br><br>Jenna sighed sadly at her friend’s words. “I know what Brian was like in the past but he seems different now. He even asked me if I believe in love and marriage and if my parents are still together; what kind of guy asks a woman those things? He seems like someone who would want the same things that I want out of a relationship.”<br><br>Lois wanted to tell her friend that she was wrong for dating Brian but she knew that she couldn't; it wasn't her place to do so. “Be careful Jenna. I just want you to be happy this time around and if he can be the one that you're looking for, then great, but if he's not, then you will have wasted your time with him.”<br><br>“I'm going to go get us some lunch; do you want anything?” Lois asked as she began to get up from her chair.<br><br>“No, I'm fine. Just get me a big bowl of chili though and if there is any left over, some root beer floats. Thanks.” Jenna said as Lois walked away from the table towards the small restaurant next door that specialized in burgers and fries along with other fast food items like hot dogs and onion rings.<br><br>Jenna was nervous about meeting Brian later on that night because it had been a week since she met him at his gym which was also the place where they were supposed to meet for their date tonight.<br><br>He seemed so different from the man that she had seen before that she was not sure how to respond. He wasn't rude, he didn't pick on anyone and his personality was so much calmer and more relaxed after she got to know him a little better. It was like the Brian that Lois told her about did not exist anymore because he was nothing like her from what she had said.<br><br>Jenna's best friend Lois had warned her about dating Brian Johnson but Jenna knew that Brian was not the man that Lois made him out to be. She knew a side of Brian that most people didn't; she saw his true colors through thick and thin.<br><br>Jenna liked his darker side as well as his sweet side, but what really drew her in to loving him was his deep soul. She felt like they were almost soul mates because they were so similar to each other in many ways including the pain of their pasts along with the love for their friends and family.<br><br>Brian really seemed like someone who wanted love and marriage just as much as Jenna did. He wasn’t abusive or cruel or selfish towards others or even around Jenna when they were together one on one; yes he could be cruel if someone stepped to him so to speak but that was only out of protection because he wanted the best for Jenna.<br><br>Jenna smiled nervously as she waited for Brian to arrive at the restaurant that night. She didn’t know why she was nervous because he hadn't done anything to make her feel like he was going to hurt her in any way but she still felt anxious about spending time with him. She had never been on a date with him and there was a lot of anticipation about what could possibly take place between them.<br><br>“Relax, Jenna, we are just hanging out like friends going over old times and then we can go back over to my house and watch a movie if you want to; I have some good old school horror films that we can watch if you want.” Brian said as he saw Jenna get more nervous as the time passed.<br><br>“I don't mind that idea at all; I love watching scary movies. Remember how much fun we used to have when we would get together?” Jenna asked as she thought of all the fun they had while they were teenagers hanging out together trying to scare each other half to death from watching scary movies and playing pranks on each other along with other things like",0
"When Natalie arrives at the address Trevor gave her, she quickly realizes that something isn't right and that Trevor might be a dangerous man .","to come up with a good story to fit this premise. When I read this premise I thought of many different ideas (one of which you can see above), but they didn't seem to fit into the story at all except as a subplot.<br><br>I personally didn't like how vague some parts were such as when Natalie was on her way to meet Trevor and she sees what looks like a murder scene outside their apartment complex (which is really a man dying from an allergic reaction). It's recent enough to still be suspicious and odd looking; however, there isn't much info provided by Natalie or explained by the writer on why this actually happening outside their apartment complex. This is important because it leads the reader to question why this happened so close to home, but we never get an answer to it (though talking with friends we came up with many ideas). Also I didn't like how difficult it would be to come up with a good story to fit this premise. When I read this premise I thought of many different ideas (one of which you can see above), but they didn't seem to fit into the story at all except as a subplot. ------------ Think about what sort of emotions you think your readers will get from reading your story and write them here:<br><br>I think that it will be a pleasant surprise for my readers to see Natalie go through this strange and mysterious adventure. It will also be funny at points, leaving my readers with a few chuckles.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>The next thing I did was write out the outline of what I, personally, thought that ""Tap Toes Doorstep"" is about and compare my notes with the analysis from Isaac. The results were very similar, but there were some differences; however, the main idea is still the same (Natalie and Trevor meet after Natalie posts an ad on Craigslist about wanting to date someone). But due to the fact that I'm going to be working in different mediums with this story (short film and graphic novels) and working at a much faster pace with writing it makes sense that there would be some major changes in how I write each individual medium. Here are the things that I came up with: ----------------------------- Let's start by looking at ""Tap Toes Doorstep"" as just a short film: Natalie arrives at her destination only to find out that she's been drugged before entering. When she finally regains consciousness she finds herself in Trevor's apartment against her will. Trevor takes Natalie into his apartment where he proceeds to rape her. Natalie manages to escape and finds a policeman. The policeman takes her back to Trevor's apartment where he then takes her to his office to interview her about what happened. During the interview, the officer confides in Natalie about his own personal life, revealing that he has a daughter who was killed by a drunk driver and that he doesn't blame himself for it because of his profession as a police officer (he should have been able to stop it from happening).<br><br>Outline: When Natalie arrives at her destination, she finds herself in an unfamiliar apartment and Trevor knocks out with sleeping pills. The next morning, she wakes up in Trevor's bedroom. Trevor explains that Natalie had agreed to come over for sex before she lost consciousness and that he was only trying to help her out by taking care of her while she was unconscious. However, Natalie leaves without saying anything else since she is uncomfortable with the situation and feels violated by him. She goes outside of his apartment complex only to realize that she is far away from home far way from where she is supposed to be and panics which results into calling the police anonymously on Trevor's phone. When the police arrive they arrest Trevor but when they see how distraught Natalie looks they decide not to put her through any further trouble, seeing as how she seems to be fine and that Trevor probably didn't mean to harm her.<br><br>Emotions: Because Natalie is a minor, she doesn't have the same rights as an adult does. She also doesn't know what to do about the situation and is left confused by all of it. Moreover, because of the events that have transpired, Natalie feels violated and frightened by Trevor and doesn't want anything else to do with him. She also feels ashamed of herself for getting mixed up with a man who is much older than her (she is 17 and he is in his mid-30's) and has no understanding of why she did it or how she let herself get into such a situation.<br><br>Theme: Being surrounded by drunk people or walking through a dark alleyway late at night can seem like harmless acts, but if you don't know where you are going or who you are with then it can lead to very dangerous situations. This is an important lesson for anyone of all ages because nobody wants to get hurt, but too often we aren't paying attention to our surroundings or we assume things about people that aren't true; this can lead us into dangerous situations from which we are unable to recover from. ----------------------------- Now let's look at ""Tap Toes Doorstep"" as it would look in the graphic novel form: Natalie meets Trevor at a bar and they start flirting with each other. Natalie finds out that Trevor is married but he sets her mind at ease by saying that he has no feelings for his wife, so they decide to go back to his apartment. When they arrive there, he reveals that he's actually a photographer who recently signed a contract with a magazine to do several photo shoots for them; one of the models had gotten sick and couldn't work so he needed someone to replace her. Natalie is excited about the idea and agrees to it immediately. She gets dressed up in clothes that Trevor brought for her and gets ready three different times before deciding which outfit she wanted to wear. Once she's ready, they head over to the photoshoot but when they arrive there, Natalie realizes that the photoshoot took place at an abandoned warehouse in an unlit parking lot. She tries taking off her clothes in order to get ready for her photo shoot but realizes she can't since she forgot where she put them; all of this makes Trevor upset and provoked him into trying to push her into having sex with him against her will.<br><br>Outline: Natalie meets Trevor at a bar while leaving work late one",0
"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","<br><br>Jenna woke up groggily and looked around her dim surroundings. Her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, but not enough to recognize where she was. Plus, she was still a little out of it from whatever drug her attacker had given her. As Jenna's mind raced, looking for answers, the memories of that day began to flood back into her mind.<br><br>***<br><br>Jenna Riley walked down the street to the local diner where she worked as a waitress. She worked nights for most of the week, and it was especially lonely on those nights when she came home late at night and there was nobody there to greet her except for her cat, Oliver. Even though she didn't really need a job anymore, Jenna found comfort in having something productive to do every night after coming home after being out on the streets all day being an independent woman and living in a city like New York all by herself.<br><br>As Jenna walked down the darkened street, she felt a little uneasy about being alone at that hour of night when most sensible people were already tucked snugly into bed at home with their families or significant others. There weren't many people walking around the street either; they were probably all inside too scared to be out at that hour of the night. She finally arrived at the diner and went inside to find her boss and friend, Shirley, standing behind the counter with a worried look on her face.<br><br>""Jenna,"" Shirley said. ""I'm so glad you're here.""<br><br>""Why?"" Jenna asked. ""Is there something wrong with Oliver or something? Did he get out of his cage again?""<br><br>""No, nothing like that,"" Shirley said reassuringly. ""I'm just really happy to see you. I'm the only one here right now, so we can watch each other's backs if anybody comes in or anything.""<br><br>A shiver of fear ran through Jenna's body as a burst of dark energy swept through her mind from nowhere. She tried to shake it off and focus on something else, but she couldn't help but wonder if there was somebody out there watching her that night, just waiting for their moment to strike. As Jenna tried to shake off that thought, she poured two cups of coffee for herself and Shirley and took them over to them at the counter before sitting down with one beside her on the countertop.<br><br>""You know what?"" Jenna said cheerfully as she took a sip of her coffee. ""We should just have a little party here tonight! We can bring in some of your other friends too and we can all celebrate having a great night so far!""<br><br>Shirley shook her head sadly. ""I don't think I can do that.""<br><br>""Why not?"" Jenna asked. ""It'll just be a little fun for us to have, especially with this feeling I'm getting that somebody's watching us right now.""<br><br>Shirley took a long sip of her coffee and sighed. Finally she said, ""Let's don't talk about it anymore because it's going to ruin our night. Let's just focus on some good tunes and celebrate life with each other, okay?""<br><br>Jenna put the cup down on the counter with a sigh and nodded, but she couldn't help thinking to herself that something bad was going to happen at any moment because it felt like there were two different worlds swirling around them at that moment: one world where they were having their little party and the other where danger was lurking in the shadows of the dark street outside.<br><br>Just as Jenna finished pouring another cup of coffee for herself, she heard a loud crash from outside in the street. She turned her head towards the door to see if someone was stumbling into the diner, but there was nobody there. She decided that it couldn't be anything to worry about and she turned her attention back to Shirley so she could continue talking about music or something like that, but then another loud crash echoed through the street.<br><br>""What on earth is going on out there?"" Shirley said anxiously as she stood up from her seat at the counter and walked over to the door and peered outside.<br><br>Suddenly, a man burst into the diner with a wild look in his eyes and he pointed a sword at them with a growling voice. ""Nobody move!""<br><br>Jenna fell off of her chair in surprise as the guy lunged towards them with his sword drawn out. She quickly got back up onto her feet just as he sliced through Shirley's neck, cutting her throat so deeply that blood sprayed all over Jenna's face and shirt as Shirley collapsed in a heap at their feet. Jenna was too shocked to speak or act at first, but then when she saw blood all over herself, it snapped her out of it enough to scream loudly.<br><br>The man quickly covered Jenna's mouth with his hand and held the sword close to her neck as he walked around behind them. As he waved it around in the air, he said, ""I don't want to kill you! Just stop screaming and do what I say and you'll be fine. Got it?""<br><br>Eventually Jenna nodded her head after a few seconds and then he took his hand off of her mouth. ""Now,"" he said as he walked towards the counter, ""what's your name?""<br><br>""Jenna Riley,"" Jenna said as she wiped blood out of her eyes.<br><br>The man nodded as he picked up the phone with his free hand. ""Good, now call your boyfriend and tell him to meet us at that abandoned amusement park down by the river.""<br><br>Jenna sighed quietly before reaching into her pocket and pulling out her cell phone. She wouldn't even know what to say to Matthias at that moment because she was still in shock from seeing the man slash Shirley's neck like that. It seemed like an eternity until she was finally able to press call on Matthias' contact information and put it up to her ear before saying, ""Matthias? Um...it's me.""<br><br>In the background on the other end of the line there was some music playing loudly in a bar or something like that because",0
Gabriel moves out of his parents' house and into his own apartment.,"<br><br>As Gabriel packed up his last box, he became acutely aware of the fact that he was moving out of the only home he had ever known. He moved to a quiet part of town, with leafy trees and grassy yards. It was a far cry from his parent's house in the city, but it would do for now.<br><br>Gabriel reached down to pick up one last box and placed it on top of the stack. He looked around his room and sighed. Part of him felt ready to move on, but another part of him felt afraid and heartbroken at leaving the only family he had ever known behind.<br><br>""It's time to go,"" Gabriel said as he slung his backpack over his shoulder.<br><br>Stepping outside into the bright sunlight was almost too much for him—like stepping into a hot shower blindfolded. The hazy sun blinded him as it reflected off the buildings around him, creating a kaleidoscope effect that almost made him sick with vertigo. He walked through the living room and out onto the patio that connected all of their units together like an apartment complex. His parents were there watching him leave again with an expressionless face as they stood on their own patio sipping orange juice and chatting.<br><br>""Have a good one,"" his father said as he turned to walk back inside.<br><br>Gabriel smiled, ""You too.""<br><br>As Gabriel left the patio, he passed his neighbor who was washing his car in the driveway. The neighbor was a man in his mid-to-late twenties who was about six-feet tall and had short blond hair and blue eyes. Gabriel couldn't remember much about him aside from the fact that he never smiled at anyone—even when people said hello to him. It made Gabriel wonder if there might be some sort of hard life that led him to be so standoffish. He thought about saying hello but knew it would sound forced so he just nodded and kept walking.<br><br>Gabriel walked down the steps behind their individual homes and back onto the sidewalk with his box in tow.

Shannon's paintings help her to deal with her grief and to find a new sense of purpose.,"<br><br>Shannon finished wiping away her tears and looked at the canvases on the floor. “I think I really will appreciate them more now, but I don’t know what to do next. Should I put them away or hang them on the wall first?”<br><br>Rosemary thought for a minute. “You can put them in your studio later on. Besides the attic room was getting crowded and now you have a whole other place to work! You can put them up there when you get ready to move each canvas. Right now, I think we should try and get the attic finished first.”<br><br>Shannon looked at the unfinished attic with some sadness. “I know you are right about the attic being too small and I am excited about my new studio, but I will miss working in my old attic. It is where I used to paint all the time with my mom. The attic always held so many memories for me and now that she is gone, I can’t bring myself to clean it out. I have left everything just the way it was.” Shannon moved around in the attic and picked up a few of her mother’s paintings. She put them back down before moving on.<br><br>Shannon’s heart was filled with sadness as she moved down the attic stairs. She had finished cleaning out the room and had started moving the furniture to the studio earlier that day. She had moved her easel and paints, but still hadn’t decided on what  to do about all of her mother’s paintings. The attic was the last room in the house that needed to be cleaned out and Shannon knew she would have to go up there soon no matter how hard it was.<br><br>Shannon put her head in her hands, overwhelmed with sadness and grief. She sat down on the bottom step of the stairs and started crying. “I just wish I had more time with you mom! You were so amazing and I miss you so much!” Shannon covered her face with her hands hoping she wouldn’t cry as hard if she couldn’t see her tears.<br><br>A few minutes later, Shannon heard a soft knock on the door. She quickly wiped her tears and stood up slowly. She opened the door to see her dad standing outside with several large boxes of pizza in his hands.<br><br>“Hey Shan, how are you doing?” He stepped into the room and set the pizza boxes down.<br><br>Shannon wrapped her arms around him and started crying again. “I miss her so much! I can’t believe she is gone!”<br><br>“I know it is hard honey. It gets easier every day, but it also makes a little harder because you miss her so much.” He patted Shannon on the back and looked over her shoulder to see that the floor was already cleared out and she was in the middle of painting.<br><br>“Hey sis!” came a cheerful voice from behind Shannon and she was greeted by the smiling face of her older sister Sara. She walked into the room and brought with her a comforting scent of lavender. “How are you holding up?”<br><br>“I am okay, just missing her so much! I still can’t believe she is gone!” Shannon  cried.<br><br>“It’s okay, we miss her too. But it is going to get better every day, and you will gradually learn to cope with it. You just need something to focus on, something positive that will make you happy. I think painting would be a great way to keep your mind busy, and do something productive to keep your mind off of her. I love seeing what you do Shannon! It brings back so many good memories from when we were kids,” Sara smiled. “You really have a talent there honey, don’t ever forget that!” Shannon felt a ray of hope from her sister’s words and it lifted her spirits. She was determined to prove that she was just as good an artist as her mother had been.<br><br>Shannon felt motivated by the praise. She felt a sense of determination to get better, and try to create more sophisticated paintings. Shannon looked at the brushes that she had gotten from her father’s art supplies, and noticed how much better they were than hers. They were expensive art brushes that had the best quality paint on them. They were much finer than the ones she had been using for her projects, and allowed for more intricate  details.<br><br>Shannon set up a small table in her space in the attic, and started to prepare her palette for a new painting. She felt comfortable and at peace with herself out there, away from the world. The paint that came with the brushes was very high quality, and she was thrilled about experimenting with it. Shannon wanted to try and emulate the style of her mom’s paintings, even if she didn’t quite have the talent and skill yet. She wanted to do it just for her mom, because she knew that her mom would be so proud of her. Shannon hoped that by doing this, she could somehow feel closer to her mother again.<br><br>Shannon wanted to create more beautiful, bigger paintings like the one that hung in her bedroom. They had all of her favorite things about the city; pictures of cars and skyscrapers, as well as various people in different clothes walking around. It was as if Shannon’s mom had known that she would love the city, even though she had never been there herself.",1
Valerie uses her wits to escape the basement and evade John Doe.,"thing, and Valerie knew that there was no way for her to escape now.<br><br>“Valerie Marx,” he said to himself while waving a meat cleaver in her direction. “I think it’s time for you to die.”<br><br>Valerie stopped running when she saw John Doe, her only avenue of escape blocked off by the vicious murderer. She tried to run towards the nearest house, but John Doe began his slow and torturous approach towards her.<br><br>John Doe came closer and closer until he was standing right in front of Valerie. Valerie did not try to fight John Doe because she knew he could easily overpower her. She knew that John Doe was going to use his meat cleaver to chop off her head, and just as he swung the blade down towards her neck, she closed her eyes and prepared for death. <br><br>Valerie opened her eyes when she felt the meat cleaver swing down towards her neck, which meant that John Doe had not killed her yet. He was about to do so, but something made him stop, and he put the meat cleaver down on the ground, instead of killing Valerie.<br><br>Valerie got up from the ground, wiping the blood off her neck and looking at John Doe with an angry and hurt expression on her face. “Why’d you let me go?” she asked angrily. “I told you I wanted to end my life. You promised me that  if I escaped before sunrise you wouldn’t come after me. Why didn’t you keep your promise? Where is the man who was going to let me die in peace?”<br><br>At that moment, Valerie saw a knife on the floor, and she quickly picked it up and pointed it towards  her own throat, trying to scare John Doe into believing that she was going to kill herself right then and there. “Where is he?” she asked menacingly. “I don’t see him anywhere! He must be dead!”<br><br>John Doe was scared for a moment, but then he remembered that Valerie Marx was just an actress, and he knew that she wasn’t going to actually kill herself. Instead, John Doe would have killed her himself if she had actually done it, and then he would have spent the rest of his life in prison. Valerie Marx had used her acting skills to get him to let her go. He knew that she was pretending to be a suicidal person because he had told her that he would let her escape before sunrise if she did. John Doe knew that Valerie was bluffing because he didn’t think that she was  really going to kill herself just for the sake of getting away from him.<br><br>John Doe quickly tried to disarm Valerie by taking the knife out of her hand, but she had already pulled it away from her neck and was ready to attack him. For a brief moment, John Doe thought about trying to get Valerie into a headlock and controlling her with his legs. He had done that trick to five other women, and it always worked out well even when he couldn’t find a weapon. It was too late for John Doe to make a move though because Valerie Marx had already started running towards the door, and she made",1

Kyle comforts Aimee and the two share a heart-to-heart conversation that leaves Aimee feeling understood for the first time.,"<br><br>Kyle looked at her with pity in his eyes, not judging her for acting childishly. “You know, Aimee, I think everyone feels that way at times. You aren’t the only one who gets nervous when you’re alone in a room full of strangers or if your family is acting a little distant. It’s okay to feel lonely sometimes, and it makes perfect sense that you do since you are alone so much. But it doesn’t mean you don’t have friends, that you don’t have people who care about you. It just means that  you’re a little nervous by yourself, that’s all. Being alone can be scary for anyone! That’s normal.”<br><br>Aimee nodded in agreement, not saying anything right away and sort of smiling at the fact that Kyle hadn’t made fun of her or told her she was acting like a wimp. She wasn’t sure if she believed him or not, but it was nice to hear that someone else understood what she felt and didn’t act like she needed to suck it up or something.<br><br>“I know how much I want to be with other people when I feel lonely too, Aimee. It’s a natural human emotion! I know that whenever I’m having a tough time with something, I just want to crawl into bed and not come out until the next morning when everyone is gone. But those feelings will pass. And then I’ll feel better and glad that I didn’t do what I initially wanted to do, which was just wallow in my own self-pity.”<br><br>Aimee furrowed her brows at Kyle. “I never want to be around other people when I’m lonely,” she said. “I just want to be alone. But it doesn’t always help even if I do that, especially if it’s late at night and there’s no one else around to talk to or anything. When I’m lonely, there’s nothing that anyone else can do. The only thing that would make me feel better is to be with a guy who actually understands what I’m going through and wants to be around me. But you don’t see a lot of guys like that, do you?” She shook her head.<br><br>“It’s not easy to find guys who are as understanding as you are, either,” she said. “I wish there were more girls out there like you and Jessica. Guys like David are so rare in this world. I mean, who would think that someone like him would be friends with me?” She smiled sadly at her own words.<br><br>Kyle gazed at Aimee for a few seconds, then shrugged and said with a casual smile, “You’ve got to have something to balance out my craziness. Even though I can be a little  too intense sometimes, I’m sensitive to other people’s needs. And if being understanding is wrong, I don’t want to be right.”<br><br>Aimee smiled at him then nodded, as if giving him an answer. She felt completely relaxed and comfortable around Kyle. That hadn’t happened to her in a while, not to this extent.<br><br>He yawned and Aimee couldn’t help but smile. She yawned too as they got up and headed towards her room. Kyle said goodnight to her parents, who were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV, and Aimee said goodbye to him shortly after. She waved goodbye to him from the door and then turned around and looked at her bedroom.<br><br>Kyle had made her bedroom seem a lot cozier with his presence, she thought to herself. He had also made her feel less alone, a feeling that Aimee wasn’t used to.<br><br>She shut the door behind her and said goodbye one last time to Kyle through the window. She then closed all the blinds and locked her door, went over to her bed, lay down on it and turned off the light. She couldn’t remember the last time she had said goodbye to anybody and felt so…<br><br>Aimee sighed. She didn’t know how to describe the feeling.<br><br>It was a feeling of sadness, yet also a feeling of comfort, a feeling or warmth and hope for the future, she thought to herself. She thought Kyle had said goodbye to her before, but it didn’t seem as real as this did, like Aimee had just said goodbye to someone who she knew could be trusted with her secrets and who would still be there for her when she needed him. <br><br>It was a feeling that Aimee had only felt once before, she thought to herself.<br><br>Aimee got up off of her bed and went over to her bookcase, opened one of the drawers at the bottom of it and started putting away her books.<br><br>She was feeling less and less like sleeping, but she knew that she had a long day ahead of her tomorrow at work, so she turned off the light, closed her eyes and tried to sleep.<br><br>But sleep wouldn’t come. It never did anymore these days, but Aimee rarely ever complained about it, because she knew that there were people who had it worse than her.",1
The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,"as you come down the stairs. You feel like you've been here before, but you know it's not true; this place is not your home.<br><br>You turn the corner and walk a short way down the hallway and then turn around to look at the room in front of you: You see a long corridor extending all the way to a wide open space at the end; there are windows on both sides where light is coming in from outside. At first glance, nothing seems amiss…but something about this picture is unsettling and unnerving. The house seems familiar somehow… but you can't shake off that feeling that everything isn't right... Someone has been here before...<br><br>You run your finger along the old wallpaper that covers the wall to your left, looking around at everything from one place to another before you continue walking. Everything looks normal enough but there is something strange about this place, something out of place…maybe it was only my imagination after all? You think to yourself as you continue walking down the hallways, looking around at everything along the way… until you come upon an old wooden door with a rusty lever handle; this door is different than all of the others around it and somehow stands out among all of them! This door is very old and decrepit along with the wall that it's attached to...<br><br>You try pushing on the lever to open the door but it's stuck! Why is this door locked? You ask yourself. It shouldn't be locked at all since no one has been here for years now… you give it another good tug but this time with more force, you can hear the wood creaking from around the handle and then there is a loud clatter as a huge chunk of wood breaks off from inside of the handle, falling to the floor.<br><br>You curse under your breath at yourself for being so careless… what if someone heard me? You think to yourself, hoping that no one heard you and that everything will be fine… But everyone seems to be out in town today so you should have some time before anyone comes by, hopefully!<br><br>I must have done that when I was trying to open it earlier…you think as you look back at the door; there are now two holes at both sides of where the knob used to be. ""Well…what else could I do…"" You say out loud as you push on the door with all your might, feeling a great strain on your muscles as they move against you. It's as if the door itself were trying to stop you from coming any further. No matter how hard you push, it refuses to budge…<br><br>You look down at your hands, they are shaking uncontrollably as everything around you starts spinning and your head starts pounding with pain…something is wrong here… the air is thick and oppressive…and your heart is racing faster than ever before. You drop to your knees, struggling to catch your breath as everything around you seems to soften and fade away into oblivion.<br><br>Where am I? You ask yourself as the world around you becomes a blur and you feel yourself losing consciousness... And then everything goes black…<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>""Julia? Julia! Can you hear me?"" The voice of a man wakes me from my troubled sleep. I feel my body moving but I don't have control over it; someone else is moving it for me. My hands seem numb and heavy as if I have been sleeping for more than one night without going to sleep for a long time. I feel so tired....as if all of my life's energy had been drained out of me completely. My head feels clouded and full of thoughts that seem so distant now; they are just out of reach...<br><br>I feel my head being lifted up into the air and I can see that I am being carried by a man in a white lab coat with a mask over his mouth as he carries me out of the dark, claustrophobic place where I was trapped all this time. I try to speak but nothing comes out of my mouth; my throat feels like it is closing up on itself and there is this strange feeling inside of me…like something is trying to erupt from its depths!<br><br>""I need more time..."" The voice of the man says as he continues to carry me through many wooden doors. ""You were supposed to get her when she was ten years old, Doctor!"" A voice tells him, this time coming from somewhere behind me. ""She could have been useful for much longer than now…"" Another voice enters the fray, this time from somewhere in front of us.<br><br>""I know..."" The doctor says with a sigh before placing me back down onto what seems to be a bench as he pulls off his mask and looks back at me with worried eyes. ""Julia… Can you hear me?"" He asks again; his face seems so familiar somehow but I can't quite place him... ""Wake up…please…"" He says as he pushes on my shoulders a little to force me to sit up but I can't seem to move at all.<br><br>""She needs more time..."" The man in the lab coat says; his voice sounds so distant now, as if something is blocking it out. I look around me and try to focus but everything seems blurry and out of reach… ""We cannot wait any longer! We have no need for a girl that is too far consumed by the taint of the spirit world... She will only serve to hurt us all..."" Another voice says from somewhere nearby.<br><br>I look at the man in front of me; his face looks so familiar... I feel like I should know his name or be able to remember where I have seen him before…but yet nothing comes to mind...who is this man?<br><br>""Please..."" He says again with a sigh as he places his hand on top of mine.<br><br>I look down at my hands; they are long and slender, with long fingers that reach up towards my elbows before disappearing underneath my sleeves…I can feel them moving; it's as if they belong to someone else…someone who isn't me but yet they feel so familiar…so much like myself….<br><br>  as you come down the stairs.

Valerie makes it to safety and the police catch John Doe.,"a tight left turn as soon as she reached the stairs.<br><br>John Doe had thought that he would have been able to see Valerie Marx from the side of the house before then, but he had been wrong about that. There was no one in sight when Valerie ran away from him. This was a bad situation for Valerie because John Doe knew that she was in trouble. Her chances of surviving the night were slim to none, and John Doe had no intention of letting her get away with her life, so he decided that there was no point in following her.<br><br>Valerie Marx had successfully escaped from John Doe, but she wasn ’t safe yet because he could catch up with her at any moment. The police were just around the corner, and she was walking towards them even though she didn’t see them. It only took a few minutes for her to reach the police station since it was only a block away from her house, but John Doe could have easily caught up with her by then if he was able to move as fast as he did before, which would allow him to be close enough to kill her when she reached the police station.<br><br>Valerie Marx did not see the police when she arrived at the station because they were around a corner and around a car. This was good for John Doe because he had less of a chance of being spotted by them as long as he kept moving to the right side of the police station. It was also good for him because it gave him more time to think about what should be done next.<br><br>The police station might have been safe for Valerie, but it was not a safe place for John Doe to be because they would be able to easily see him if he went inside. They might have also been able to find out who he was from the information that he left behind in the basement. If they were  able to do that, then he might have ended up being under more suspicion than before. Because of those reasons, it was better for him to just keep running for now and wait until things cooled off before taking another victim.<br><br>If Valerie Marx walked inside the police station, then she would be safe from John Doe for now because the police would surround her and keep her from harm. On the other hand, Valerie did not want to go into the police station because she had more important places to go.<br><br>Male Celebrity A was not at the police station when Valerie Marx arrived there because he had gone to Valerie’s house to make sure she was safe. When Valerie arrived at her house, Male Celebrity A was already there. He took Valerie inside her house and locked the door so that John Doe could not get in. Male Celebrity A talked with Valerie while they were inside her home and comforted her as she went through what had just happened to her.<br><br>Valerie was glad when Male Celebrity A arrived because she had been starting to feel alone and scared after moving house and changing jobs. She explained everything that happened in the basement to Male Celebrity A, including how she got there and why she was moving house. She told Male Celebrity A how scared she had been and how she was moving house because of the situation with John Doe, but also because her old apartment building was right next to an old graveyard. Valerie was in a bad way because moving house like that would make anyone feel alone, and she needed someone to support her through that kind of ordeal. <br><br>Male Celebrity A listened to everything Valerie said without saying anything for a long time. After he finished listening, he said that Valerie had done a brave thing when she went into the basement to confront John Doe.<br><br>Male Celebrity A was very happy when he heard what Valerie had done. He did not think it would be brave to visit a murderer in a dark basement, but Male Celebrity A knew that Valerie had wanted to do that and was happy that she did.<br><br>Male Celebrity A told Valerie that she was very brave because she had stood up to the killer after waking up tied up, without being able to move or speak. He said that it was a very scary thing to do, but she had done it and was safe now.<br><br>Valerie Marx was happy to hear what Male Celebrity A said. It made her feel better about herself and the situation.",1
Jenna Adams meets Brian Johnson and immediately feels drawn to him.,"<br><br>Jenna Adams, a woman who had never had a long-term relationship, was sitting across from her best friend, Lois.

What is it?” Lois asked.<br><br>Jenna looked around the restaurant to see if anyone was listening in on their conversation. “I met someone last week and I think he might be…the one.” Jenna was nervous as she said this out loud for the first time to anyone other than herself.<br><br>Lois sat back in her chair and put her head in her hands for a few moments in surprise before speaking again. “You met someone? Like someone that you want more than sex? That you want to marry someday? Like someone that would become your partner forever and ever? You can do better than Brian Johnson! He's an asshole that only cares about himself! How could you possibly be interested in him? You'll end up getting hurt by him if you go out with him!”<br><br>“Lois, I know that you don't like him, but we're having dinner tonight. He seems really nice.”<br><br>Lois put her head in her hands again and took a long breath before speaking again. “Jenna, please be careful. Do not commit your heart to someone that is an asshole just so you can find love or something like that because it will come back to haunt you one day. You really deserve someone better than a man-child that only cares about himself and his image. Don't rush into this relationship; I know that you want real love but trust me when I tell you that he will break your heart if things between the two of you get serious. He's already done it once when he dumped his wife for slutty blonde bimbo Brittany over a year ago! Jenna, he's cheap, obnoxious and cruel to the people around him at times!”<br><br>Jenna sighed sadly at her friend’s words. “I know what Brian was like in the past but he seems different now. He even asked me if I believe in love and marriage and if my parents are still together; what kind of guy asks a woman those things? He seems like someone who would want the same things that I want out of a relationship.”<br><br>Lois wanted to tell her friend that she was wrong for dating Brian but she knew that she couldn't; it wasn't her place to do so. “Be careful Jenna. I just want you to be happy this time around and if he can be the one that you're looking for, then great, but if he's not, then you will have wasted your time with him.”<br><br>“I'm going to go get us some lunch; do you want anything?” Lois asked as she began to get up from her chair.<br><br>“No, I'm fine. Just get me a big bowl of chili though and if there is any left over, some root beer floats. Thanks.” Jenna said as Lois walked away from the table towards the small restaurant next door that specialized in burgers and fries along with other fast food items like hot dogs and onion rings.<br><br>Jenna was nervous about meeting Brian later on that night because it had been a week since she met him at his gym which was also the place where they were supposed to meet for their date tonight.<br><br>He seemed so different from the man that she had seen before that she was not sure how to respond. He wasn't rude, he didn't pick on anyone and his personality was so much calmer and more relaxed after she got to know him a little better. It was like the Brian that Lois told her about did not exist anymore because he was nothing like her from what she had said.<br><br>Jenna's best friend Lois had warned her about dating Brian Johnson but Jenna knew that Brian was not the man that Lois made him out to be. She knew a side of Brian that most people didn't; she saw his true colors through thick and thin.<br><br>Jenna liked his darker side as well as his sweet side, but what really drew her in to loving him was his deep soul. She felt like they were almost soul mates because they were so similar to each other in many ways including the pain of their pasts along with the love for their friends and family.<br><br>Brian really seemed like someone who wanted love and marriage just as much as Jenna did. He wasn’t abusive or cruel or selfish towards others or even around Jenna when they were together one on one; yes he could be cruel if someone stepped to him so to speak but that was only out of protection because he wanted the best for Jenna.<br><br>Jenna smiled nervously as she waited for Brian to arrive at the restaurant that night. She didn’t know why she was nervous because he hadn't done anything to make her feel like he was going to hurt her in any way but she still felt anxious about spending time with him. She had never been on a date with him and there was a lot of anticipation about what could possibly take place between them.<br><br>“Relax, Jenna, we are just hanging out like friends going over old times and then we can go back over to my house and watch a movie if you want to; I have some good old school horror films that we can watch if you want.” Brian said as he saw Jenna get more nervous as the time passed.<br><br>“I don't mind that idea at all; I love watching scary movies. Remember how much fun we used to have when we would get together?” Jenna asked as she thought of all the fun they had while they were teenagers hanging out together trying to scare each other half to death from watching scary movies and playing pranks on each other along with other things like",0
Trevor Lockwood ends up being a serial killer who lures women to their death and Natalie narrowly escapes becoming his next victim .,"to realize that she had been played. Trevor had lured her out to his home under false pretenses with the hopes that she would sleep with him. Natalie figured that he might have been trying to rape her, since she was stuck out in the middle of nowhere with no means of escape and a man who wanted to hurt her.<br><br>After a few weeks, Natalie moved to a city close by. She never told anyone about what Trevor Lockwood had done to her, not even her closest friends. She was ashamed of what had happened to her and she thought people would think less of her if they knew that she had slept with a man in order to get money. She had played Trevor Lockwood and now she felt like he was playing her, this time by trying to lure her into his home where he could kill her.<br><br>Natalie Harper’s home was a modest one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of a city. She had moved to the city so that she could get a job at a grocery store closer to her home.<br><br>She moved in with some friends from her hometown, but three months later she found herself living alone again due to disagreements over money and rent with her roommates. She had found the apartment after being referred there by  the manager at a local grocery store where she worked.<br><br>Natalie had been working as a cashier at the grocery store for about two months when she ran into Trevor Lockwood again, who wanted to set up another meeting with her. Natalie declined. Trevor persisted, sending Natalie emails that were rude and pushy.<br><br>Eventually Natalie changed her mind, realizing that she needed the money to pay her bills. Trevor Lockwood had offered her a job working as a model for his modeling agency. She was reluctant at first but decided to give it a try because it paid well and she would be able to quit her job at the grocery store, which Natalie realized that she didn’t care much for.<br><br>Natalie agreed to meet Trevor Lockwood at a local restaurant and discuss the offer in person.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was a handsome young man with bright eyes and short dark hair. He was about twenty-seven years old Natalie guessed, though she couldn’t be sure. Trevor Lockwood had a confident air about him. He was very persuasive and knew how to work people, Natalie observed. And he seemed like he could be dangerous if provoked, she thought. He definitely wasn’t someone she wanted to cross. But  the money sounded too good to pass up.<br><br>When Natalie arrived at the restaurant, Trevor Lockwood was already sitting at a table, alone. He greeted her with a smile and some small talk about the weather. It was unusually cold and snowing outside for this time of year. Natalie pulled aside her coat to  reveal a tight black dress underneath. The dress was mostly sheer and showed off Natalie’s ample cleavage.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood smiled appreciatively, his eyes taking in every inch of Natalie’s body, lingering on her breasts. After glancing down at her cleavage a few more times Natalie finally pulled the coat back over her chest and pretended to be interested in a news article she had retrieved from the check-stand rack. Trevor Lockwood’s eyes kept darting back to Natalie’s chest, his face flushed with arousal.<br><br>Natalie looked up at Trevor Lockwood and smiled coyly, knowing that she was getting to him. Trevor Lockwood responded by scooting closer to her on the bench seat of his booth. Natalie moved back slightly so that their knees weren’t touching and waited for Trevor Lockwood to continue.<br><br>After some more small talk about Natalie struggling to make rent",1
"Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.","else where it is warm and has green fields?”<br><br>Jack shrugged his shoulders. “It’s just the first place that came to mind, Eliza. I don’t want to be here anymore. It reminds me of you too much, and I can’t stand the thought of that.”<br><br>Eliza moved closer to him again.<br><br>“It reminds you of me? You know, Jack, I may be dead, but I can still feel your touch on my skin. I can still feel our bodies pressing together and how strong you were when you made love to me.”<br><br>Jack moved closer to her again, as close as the grave would allow him, and looked into her eyes.<br><br>Jack stared at her for a long moment before saying anything to her. He could feel his heart beat faster as he looked into her beautiful blue eyes and listened to her soft voice.<br><br>“I moved to this place because of you, Eliza. I can’t be here anymore because it is where you died, and that is where I will always remember you. That is where everyone will remember you, and nothing could be more painful than that.”<br><br>Eliza moved her cheek to Jack’s hand while he was still speaking, and she moved her body so that they were pressed against each other.<br><br>“Moving to a new place won’t lessen the pain of losing me, Jack. It won’t make our memories fade away. Moving to a new place – anywhere – will only be a way for you to forget me.”<br><br>Jack moved his hand away from Eliza’s cheek and he placed it on the top of her gravestone. “Moving will be a way for me to get my life back,” he said as he moved his other hand to the gravestone on the other side of Eliza’s grave. “Moving is a way for us to be together again.”<br><br>Eliza could tell that Jack was getting upset with her and she moved her head away from his hand so that she could move to the other side of the gravestone. “It will never be like it used to be,” she said.<br><br>Jack moved closer to Eliza so that they were standing right next to each other once again. “Moving will make it better,” he said as  he reached out to hold her hand.<br><br>Eliza could feel the warmth coming from Jack’s body as his hand reached for hers and she pulled away from him before they touched. “I don’t want you to forget me, Jack,” she said. “I love you and I need you.”<br><br>Jack tried to talk to Eliza once again, but she didn’t say anything and he turned his head so that he could see her face as she looked at him coldly.<br><br>“You just need to get on with your life, Jack,” she said as she took a step away from him. “This is all I can do for you now.”<br><br>Jack tried to talk to her again but Eliza didn’t say anything and she disappeared before he could get a good look at her face. Jack tried to grasp for her hand but she was gone and he stared at the spot where she had stood, trying to understand what was going on.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost had been standing right next to Jack in the graveyard when she spoke to him, but there was no sign of her when he looked  around. He knew that she had gone somewhere because he could feel her presence, but he couldn’t see her any longer.<br><br>Jack walked around the gravestones and looked carefully amongst the grass as if Eliza would suddenly appear and tell him that none of this was real and that he had been dreaming all of it. He couldn’t find Eliza anywhere and she didn’t say anything as he searched, but she did nothing to stop him either.<br><br>It was clear to him that she couldn’t see him any more either. She looked like a ghost to everyone else, but her eyes were open and her ghostly appearance wasn’t accompanied by a translucent white glow like what he had seen in Halloween movies. She was just invisible to everyone except for Jack.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack walked around the graveyard, but he could tell that she was happy with how things had turned out. Eliza’s ghost had been one of the nicest ghosts that he ever knew, and it was wonderful to see her again. She deserved a happy ending and so did he. She didn’t say anything at all during their time in the graveyard. <br><br>Jack watched her for a while longer and then he went over to his car. There was a lot that he wanted to do in the days ahead, but there was also a lot of unfinished business that had to be taken care of before that could happen. Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack got into his car, but she was looking at him again.<br><br>Jack wanted to tell her how much he appreciated what she had done for him after he had lost her. He wanted to thank her and ask her if there was any way that she could finish the job so that he wouldn’t have to let go. Jack wanted to tell her that she had done enough and that it was time for him to move on with the rest of his life. He wanted Eliza’s ghost to know that she didn’t have to be invisible any longer, and that she didn’t have to let go.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Eliza, please don’t leave me alone. Let go of me!”<br><br>Eliza said nothing at all.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Let go of me! Let me go! Let go! Please let me go!”<br><br>Jack tried to hold on to her, but she was gone.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost told him not to fight it and asked Jack to let go of what he was holding onto and then move on with his life. Jack asked her why, and Eliza told Jack that she wanted him to let go so that she could finally let go of him.<br><br>Jack’s ghost told Eliza that he didn’t want to move on. He didn’t want to let go of her. He didn’t want to live his  life without her. Eliza asked Jack what he would do if she stayed.<br><br>Jack said to her, “I want you to stay.” He wanted some sort of assurance that the ghost in front of him was really there, and so he asked her to repeat the question.  More quietly this time, she asked again if he wanted her to stay. When Eliza repeated the question a third time, Jack said that he did want her to stay, and so she told him that if he really wanted her to stay then she would.<br><br>Jack took a step toward the gravestone and then stopped. Eliza’s grave, Jack thought with the sudden realization of what he was doing. He was going to visit Eliza’s grave. He wasn’t visiting her body; he was visiting her grave. He was burying her all over again, this time without a body to bury. Jack took another step toward Eliza’s grave and started to weep. “Please don’t go,” he said choking on his words. “Please don’t leave me. Please stay with me. Don’t go away again. Please don’t go away .”<br><br>Eliza said that she wouldn’t leave him and that she would never go away again, but Jack was already moving toward the gravestone. He stopped when he got there and slowly walked around the gravestone looking for her whistle, which Eliza always wore around her neck. With each whistle he blew, Jack felt a hole opening up in his chest.<br><br>Jack found Eliza’s whistle under a rose bush that grew by the gravestone. He picked the rose petals off of it and blew the whistle several times, but when he stopped blowing, he felt empty again. <br><br>Jack blew the whistle one last time and put it in his pocket. The whistle was cold in his hand, and it felt heavy with Eliza’s absence. Jack wiped the tears from his face, put on his coat and left the graveyard feeling as if all hope had been drained from him. He sat down on a park bench and looked up at the winter sky. Jack couldn’t stop thinking about Eliza, but he knew that she was right. It was time for him to let go of his past and move on with his life. But it didn’t mean that he had to like it.<br><br>Jack blew the whistle one more time, and then he put it in his pocket and left the park. He walked for a few blocks until he came to a small flower shop on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street and went inside. Jack bought mums, gardenias, geraniums, and roses and took them back to Eliza’s grave. He arranged the flowers around the base of the headstone and then sat down on the ground and leaned against it.<br><br>Jack stayed there until it started to get dark, and then he got up and brushed the dirt off of his hands. He looked at the headstone one last time and then turned and walked away.",1

All stories under the ""In Production"" status are currently being worked on by me.<br><br>Tap Toes Doorstep (Completed) Story: 9/10 Plot: 10/10 Characters: 8/10 Dialogue: 8/10 Flow: 10/10 Overall Score: 41 out of 50 Premise: A young woman moves into her new apartment complex and finds herself befriending mysterious residents who have peculiar habits. In particular, she meets an old woman whose tapping toe seems to foretell bad things happening. Premise Analysis & Evaluation : I have always been a fan of the horror genre, especially when it comes to slasher films and other films with strange happenings that lead to deaths. The first thing that came to mind when I read this premise was the movie ""Poltergeist"", which also deals with supernatural happenings in an apartment complex. I think that this premise lends itself very well as a horror film because of how strange it is in comparison to normal activities in an apartment complex, let alone everyday life. It would be interesting if the writer delves into why some of these activities happen, which is something I normally enjoy seeing in horror films. Premise Analysis & Evaluation (Cont'd): There isn't much to do here except for creating a good story. I feel that this premise lends itself greatly for a ghost story, because ghost stories often deal with bizarre happenings that don't make sense. A good writer could make the protagonist's new apartment complex a haunted one, and the reader could find themselves being scared as the protagonist is. However, I also like the idea of making this a time travel film because every supernatural story is essentially a time travel story (another example would be ""The Butterfly Effect""). There are two different outcomes here: either make it a ghost story or make it into an actual time travel film.<br><br>Premise Analysis & Evaluation (Cont'd): An issue I had when writing this analysis was how to present the information in comparison to other stories on FictionPress. One way of doing so is to compare/contrast it with movies or other similar ideas around on FictionPress, which is something that's usually done when writing an analysis. The problem with doing so is that there really isn't any other stories similar to ""Tap Toes Doorstep"" out there on FictionPress--at least not ones with similar premises--so it would be difficult to make comparisons. The only way of solving this problem is to not make comparisons, which would be a shame. Therefore, I decided to stop doing analysis in this manner and instead talk about the premise itself and its positives and negatives, which is something that a lot of other writers do (and have done).<br><br>I have always been a fan of the horror genre, especially when it comes to slasher films and other films with strange happenings that lead to deaths.

It's recent enough to still be suspicious and odd looking; however, there isn't much info provided by Natalie or explained by the writer on why this actually happening outside their apartment complex. This is important because it leads the reader to question why this happened so close to home, but we never get an answer to it (though talking with friends we came up with many ideas). Also I didn't like how difficult it would be",0
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.","stunned at everything that he had just told me. I wasn't sure what it all meant yet, but it seemed to me that I really didn't have much choice in the matter anymore. I would have to tag along behind him and help him solve the cases – or he wouldn't hire me!<br><br>""So our first case together will be…?"" I said when there was a lull in our conversation. It was already very clear to me that there wasn't much for me to do – but I still felt like I needed an assignment of some kind!<br><br>""The dog park murders,"" Mr Smith replied with a slight smile on his face. ""I have just been hired by the leader of the Canine Council – Damien Deakins – and he wants us to solve these murders no matter what! If we can do this, then they will pay us handsomely and we can use some of those funds to build a secret base…""<br><br>""What is their secret?"" I interrupted, growing more excited as this conversation went on. It sounded like it might be interesting after all!<br><br>""The location of their entire clan,"" Mr Smith replied with a knowing smile on his face. ""That is how they are able to travel in secret and pass unnoticed in their human form. The biggest problem with that, however, is that if they reveal that location to their enemies, then they will be attacked and destroyed. So they keep it secret and let everyone think that they are nothing more than a myth…but we can prove them wrong, my dear Kitty.""<br><br>""Alright,"" I replied with a slight nod of my head. ""So what would your plan be?""<br><br>""We have to work fast and solve the case before the police,"" he replied as he looked out of the window once again. ""My sources told me that if we don't solve it quickly enough, then a man named Fluffy Barkin might take over the case for himself.""<br><br>""Is he really named Fluffy Barkin?"" I asked – feeling completely skeptical about this news. Was this some kind of a joke?<br><br>""No,"" Mr Smith said with a shake of his head. ""He's just called 'Fluffy' instead – because he is so hairy around his neck! He's very strong and good at catching criminals – but has no real clue about how to solve crimes. He'll need our help on this one!""<br><br>I let out a small laugh at this, but Mr Smith didn't share my amusement. It was clear that he was serious about this case, which I didn't know how to take. I couldn't believe that a man had named himself after his fur – and I thought that it would be the start of a very strange adventure indeed!<br><br>Chapter 3<br><br>For the rest of the day, we drove around in Mr Smith's car and asked innocent passersby if they had seen anything strange happening at the dog park recently. At first, it seemed like everyone had seen something – but all their answers were so different that it was hard to tell what was going on at all!<br><br>""So, they all said something different?"" Mr Smith asked me, raising an eyebrow at me in disbelief. ""What kind of story did they tell you?""<br><br>""Well…they all said that there were dogs running wild and attacking each other,"" I replied, feeling completely baffled by everything that he was saying. It seemed like Mr Smith had no clue about who to trust…which wasn't such a bad thing for me! ""They kept saying that some of the animals were missing…and then when I asked them why these things kept happening…they just said…""<br><br>""They just said that it was because of the 'wolf who comes to this place',"" Mr Smith finished for me. ""And that's it?""<br><br>""No,"" I said with a shake of my head. ""They also said that this wolf is really cute… but if you try to pet him all of these spikes will come out of his back and he'll try to kill you!""<br><br>""What?"" Mr Smith asked, growing more and more confused as we continued to talk. ""You think they meant something else…don't you?""<br><br>""Well, think about it,"" I replied with a smile on my face. These people weren't just talking about a real wolf – they must have been talking about our next case! It seemed like no one could figure out what was going on at the dog park – which meant that we had a great chance at figuring out what was going on. The only thing was, how were we going to do that?<br><br>We drove in silence for the next few minutes as we tried to figure out what our plan would be, but I soon realized that there wasn't one at all! This case seemed impossible – how could we simply solve it? We had no suspects at all! We couldn't even figure out what was going on at all!<br><br>""Maybe we shouldn't have come here,"" Mr Smith finally said with a sigh. ""If nothing is going on here then we should have probably stayed home – who knows what else could have happened? Maybe we've taken too long to figure this case out and it's too late now?""<br><br>I nodded my head silently in agreement, but I also said, ""Mr Smith, no one knows where the wolf is or how he's killing these dogs…but me and you are the only ones who can look into the case!""<br><br>""I'm not really sure if there is a case to look at,"" Mr Smith replied with a frown. ""But you're right – we are the only ones who know about this situation and there must be someone behind this – even if it isn't Fluffy Barkin.""<br><br>'What about Sergei Snipe?' I wondered. Was he behind all of this somehow? Was he trying to start some kind of war between dogs and cats? Well, maybe it didn't matter one way or another – all that mattered was that we do our best in order to solve this mystery!<br><br>Chapter 4<br><br>As soon",0
Valerie uses her wits to escape the basement and evade John Doe.,"thing, and Valerie knew that there was no way for her to escape now.<br><br>“Valerie Marx,” he said to himself while waving a meat cleaver in her direction. “I think it’s time for you to die.”<br><br>Valerie stopped running when she saw John Doe, her only avenue of escape blocked off by the vicious murderer. She tried to run towards the nearest house, but John Doe began his slow and torturous approach towards her.<br><br>John Doe came closer and closer until he was standing right in front of Valerie. Valerie did not try to fight John Doe because she knew he could easily overpower her. She knew that John Doe was going to use his meat cleaver to chop off her head, and just as he swung the blade down towards her neck, she closed her eyes and prepared for death. <br><br>Valerie opened her eyes when she felt the meat cleaver swing down towards her neck, which meant that John Doe had not killed her yet. He was about to do so, but something made him stop, and he put the meat cleaver down on the ground, instead of killing Valerie.<br><br>Valerie got up from the ground, wiping the blood off her neck and looking at John Doe with an angry and hurt expression on her face. “Why’d you let me go?” she asked angrily. “I told you I wanted to end my life. You promised me that  if I escaped before sunrise you wouldn’t come after me. Why didn’t you keep your promise? Where is the man who was going to let me die in peace?”<br><br>At that moment, Valerie saw a knife on the floor, and she quickly picked it up and pointed it towards  her own throat, trying to scare John Doe into believing that she was going to kill herself right then and there. “Where is he?” she asked menacingly. “I don’t see him anywhere! He must be dead!”<br><br>John Doe was scared for a moment, but then he remembered that Valerie Marx was just an actress, and he knew that she wasn’t going to actually kill herself. Instead, John Doe would have killed her himself if she had actually done it, and then he would have spent the rest of his life in prison. Valerie Marx had used her acting skills to get him to let her go. He knew that she was pretending to be a suicidal person because he had told her that he would let her escape before sunrise if she did. John Doe knew that Valerie was bluffing because he didn’t think that she was  really going to kill herself just for the sake of getting away from him.<br><br>John Doe quickly tried to disarm Valerie by taking the knife out of her hand, but she had already pulled it away from her neck and was ready to attack him. For a brief moment, John Doe thought about trying to get Valerie into a headlock and controlling her with his legs. He had done that trick to five other women, and it always worked out well even when he couldn’t find a weapon. It was too late for John Doe to make a move though because Valerie Marx had already started running towards the door, and she made",1
The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"worse than it already was.<br><br>It was hard to stand, it was hard to breathe, and it was hard to do anything but cry right now. She didn't understand how she could have been so stupid to ever think that things would be good again; she didn't know why she had ever believed any of this would ever be okay. If Daisy didn't want her then nobody wanted her.<br><br>Lisa wanted to blame Daisy for not even trying to make it better, for not even trying to make Lisa feel like there was still something good in her life left somehow, but she knew it wasn't Daisy's fault; in fact it wasn't anyone's fault. It wasn't anyone's fault that Lisa had been left alone over and over again when there were always people who could help her or at least be kinder than they were when they realized that she had lost the most important thing in her life and nobody was coming back anymore. She had never been able to find anyone who truly cared about how hard she had been struggling from all those years before. She knew that blaming Daisy now would only make things worse and nothing else; maybe someday Daisy would understand what happened and why Lisa acted the way she did when everything changed so much after everything else changed so much.<br><br>Lisa had given up trying to find anything good in her life long before she found out that there was a cure for cancer, but now she didn't know what to do. It was hard enough knowing that she was sick and that she might not live much longer even if she didn't die from the disease but it was even harder knowing that there wasn't anyone who did like her anymore or wanted her around anyway. This was the hardest part; Lisa thought about all the things she had known before this happened and all of them were easier to keep in mind than what had happened between Lisa's family and Daisy now. It was easier to try to forget about everything else instead of remembering it, but it couldn't go on any longer.<br><br>The doctors said they were ready for her now so Lisa stood up and followed one of them down the hall. The hospital smelled like sickness, death, and other things that were worse than either of those things could ever be on their own. Lisa knew how important hospitals could be but they never made her feel as good as other people always seemed to think they did; maybe it was because hospitals reminded her too much of herself when she thought about how sick she always felt since all of this started years ago when Lisa called Daisy her best friend. It was easier to act like she wasn't sick because every time Lisa acted like she was fine it just made her feel better than if anyone else ever did.<br><br>Lisa thought that maybe this was the only reason why she had always felt the way she did whenever she went to a hospital; it wasn't some kind of psychological problem or anything like that, it just made her feel better about herself. Even if it didn't make her any worse, alone in a hospital room for hours and hours at a time, waiting for someone to tell you what was going on when there wasn't anything hopeful about how long anyone had been telling you that there would be nothing hopeful about how long anyone could tell you anything. The worst part about being in a hospital was never knowing when something would happen or how long you'd have to wait for it; Lisa hated everything about hospitals but they were necessary and the only place in town where they could do anything to help Lisa now.<br><br>The only thing that made this worse than all of those other times Lisas been here before was now even more people knew what had happened and more people cared too, but nobody knew what to do because there was nothing anybody could do. Nobody could do anything until either Lisa got better or she died and everyone knew that just like they all knew that nobody was going to try to do something unless they thought they could save Lisa's life even if they never cared about Lisa when she needed someone.<br><br>Lisa couldn't remember why she had ever tried or wanted anyone else to care about her now that Daisy had left her but it didn't matter since nobody cared about Lisa or wanted to help Lisa anymore; Lisa deserved this though even if she hadn't been expecting it and she still knew there was nothing anyone could do for her anymore. It was just going to be a matter of time now; it would be a matter of waiting until Lisa died from the disease, the same way so many others had died from the same thing before, or until the doctors figured out a way to save her life and everyone else got a second chance at living without worrying about whether or not they'd find out what happened to people or what happened in places where there wasn't anyone who really left when you needed them the most.<br><br>Lisa wondered how things were going with Daisy now that Daisy was on her own again, but Lisa knew it wasn't any of her business. She couldn't call Daisy and ask after her because she still thought that was rude somehow even though everything else was more rude than asking how someone was doing. It always bothered Lisa whenever anyone asked her how she was doing because they didn't really want to know, they just thought that it would be polite to ask.<br><br>Some people would always try to be polite even if that meant lying all the time; Lisa hated their lies and she hated them even more when it happened now that there was no one who really cared at all anymore. She wondered what Daisy's life was like now that she had gone back to school and left Lisa alone in the hospital without anyone else who could help her or talk to her or make sure everything would be okay for a little while longer.<br><br>Lisa sat in the hospital room and waited for hours on end until her parents could come back from work and visit her again, but she knew this time wouldn't be as quick as every other time before because nobody was coming anytime soon. Nobody came back when Lisa started losing weight again or getting worse a long time ago, so nobody came back when Lisa started getting sicker again either; now everyone just left whenever Lisa got sick because it wasn't any of their business anymore. No one wanted to have anything to do with whatever had happened anymore or wanted Daisy around anyway since Daisy didn't want any of",0

So I picked it up off the side table, blew off the dust that had accumulated on it, and went upstairs.<br><br>			I opened my bedroom door and walked inside. Before I could even turn around all the way, I stopped cold in my tracks when I heard the sound of a loud gasp then the unmistakable sound of someone vomiting.<br><br>			""What are you doing here?"" I demanded as I turned around to confront the interloper in my room. I was stunned when I saw who it was that had broken into my house.<br><br>			""Dawnie!"" Nate said from the edge of my bed where he sat leaning over a wastebasket with his head resting on his arms as he continued to heave up his guts into it. He looked like hell with dark circles under his eyes, sunken cheeks, and greyish skin that made me think he had been sweating bucket loads and not bathing very often since we last talked. He raised his head up as if to see me better, but didn't appear to be able to focus on anything for more than a split second before he put his head back down on his arms again and continued heaving up whatever was left in him. The vomit smelled bitter and somehow familiar, which made me wonder if he had been drinking.<br><br>			""What on earth were you thinking Nate? You can't just break into a person's house and take over like that. This is my house and I don't want anyone..."" I was at a loss for words, my anger flared up, but then quickly subsided when he told me why he broke into my house.<br><br>			""I have nowhere else to go,"" Nate said weakly as he slowly raised his head up again to face me. His eyes glazed over and unfocused as he tried to look at me as if seeing me for the first time. ""There are Takers outside,"" Nate said in a voice so cold and lifeless that it shocked me to hear such an emotional sound coming out of him at all because it was something I had never heard before, not even in the most miserable or frightened of moments. It occurred to me this was probably the most frightened he had ever been in his life because of the Takers. ""They found us,"" Nate said after another moment passed with him staring off into space not really focusing on anything which made me think he wasn't really talking to me at all anymore which made PTSD sound about right for this situation because nothing about this situation seemed normal for Nate or anything else.<br><br>			""What do you mean Takers? What have they done to you?"" I asked as I moved over to him and knelt down in front of him. He was still sitting there with his head in his arms, leaning forward, and shivering as if he had just been outside in the cold for a long time. ""Are you okay Nate? Are you sick?"" I reached out with my hand and touched him on the shoulder. He looked up at me from his position on the bed and after a moment of being totally still while I looked into his eyes, he started sobbing uncontrollably again which made me realize he must not be okay after all because he had never shown any outward signs of emotion before like this so it wasn't like me to see him crying or shaking like this now. It was really freaking me out because I didn't want to think that Nate would ever allow a Taker anywhere near him or anyone else either because the one thing everyone knew about Nate was that he had never been afraid of anything in all his life which was why everyone thought so highly of him despite whatever their own personal problem or internal demons might be that kept them from facing their fears or taking chances before and for some people maybe even afterwards too.<br><br>			""It's the Takers."" Nate whispered in a voice so low it was barely a whisper at all. ""The Takers are coming!"" he yelled with his voice breaking when he said, ""they found us."" I watched as Nate buried his face in my bed sheets and continued to shake like crazy as tears streamed down his cheeks and he started sobbing again for what seemed like an eternity. He then said, ""They're going to kill me..."" with a quivering voice that made me start sobbing too for a couple minutes before I composed myself enough to try and talk to him again, but he wouldn't answer me until I touched him on the shoulder again. As soon as I did, he looked up at me with his eyes filled with tears and even more fear than they were before. Nate had never been afraid of anything in his entire life which made this look truly terrifying to see on this normally tough guy as if what ever happened between now and then had completely broken him and turned him into someone else entirely which made me wonder if I was even still talking to the same person anymore or not because it seemed that something had seriously changed inside of him while he was out there somehow or maybe it was something to do with this change that <br><br>The world ended in a cataclysmic event.<br><br>In the aftermath of the cataclysm, the survivors searched for an explanation.

They were called Takers because they took everything you had and left you here to die in your misery if they didn't like what you had to offer them.<br><br>But humanity rose up in defiance against the Takers and won a brief victory before they were driven back into hiding by a plague that swept through their ranks, killing thousands and forcing them into quarantine deep underground where they were kept safe from the deadly disease that caused madness in those it infected but...<br><br>An excerpt from my ever evolving story idea: End of Days 2 - Chapter 1<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>			Before I could go upstairs to pack a few things for my escape, I looked around my living room for anything else I might need and found nothing that would be useful for escaping with me except my crystal ball (which was more of a novelty item than anything else). So I picked it up off the side table, blew off the dust that had accumulated on it, and went upstairs.<br><br>			I opened my bedroom door and walked inside. Before I could even turn around all the way, I stopped cold in my tracks when I heard the sound of a loud gasp then the unmistakable sound of someone vomiting.<br><br>			""What are you doing here?"" I demanded as I turned around to confront the interloper in my room. I was stunned when I saw who it was that had broken into my house.<br><br>			""Dawnie!"" Nate said from the edge of my bed where he sat leaning over a wastebasket with his head resting on his arms as he continued to heave up his guts into it. He looked like hell with dark circles under his eyes, sunken cheeks, and greyish skin that made me think he had been sweating bucket loads and not bathing very often since we last talked. He raised his head up as if to see me better, but didn't appear to be able to focus on anything for more than a split second before he put his head back down on his arms again and continued heaving up whatever was left in him. The vomit smelled bitter and somehow familiar, which made me wonder if he had been drinking.<br><br>			""What on earth were you thinking Nate? You can't just break into a person's house and take over like that. This is my house and I don't want anyone..."" I was at a loss for words, my anger flared up, but then quickly subsided when he told me why he broke into my house.<br><br>			""I have nowhere else to go,"" Nate said weakly as he slowly raised his head up again to face me. His eyes glazed over and unfocused as he tried to look at me as if seeing me for the first time. ""There are Takers outside,"" Nate said in a voice so cold and lifeless that it shocked me to hear such an emotional sound coming out of him at all because it was something I had never heard before, not even in the most miserable or frightened of moments. It occurred to me this was probably the most frightened he had ever been in his life because of the Takers. ""They found us,"" Nate said after another moment passed with him staring off into space not really focusing on anything which made me think he wasn't really talking to me at all anymore which made PTSD sound about right for this situation because nothing about this situation seemed normal for Nate or anything else.<br><br>			""What do you mean Takers? What have they done to you?"" I asked as I moved over to him and knelt down in front of him. He was still sitting there with his head in his arms, leaning forward, and shivering as if he had just been outside in the cold for a long time. ""Are you okay Nate? Are you sick?"" I reached out with my hand and touched him on the shoulder. He looked up at me from his position on the bed and after a moment of being totally still while I looked into his eyes, he started sobbing uncontrollably again which made me realize he must not be okay after all because he had never shown any outward signs of emotion before like this so it wasn't like me to see him crying or shaking like this now. It was really freaking me out because I didn't want to think that Nate would ever allow a Taker anywhere near him or anyone else either because the one thing everyone knew about Nate was that he had never been afraid of anything in all his life which was why everyone thought so highly of him despite whatever their own personal problem or internal demons might be that kept them from facing their fears or taking chances before and for some people maybe even afterwards too.<br><br>			""It's the Takers."" Nate whispered in a voice so low it was barely a whisper at all. ""The Takers are coming!"" he yelled with his voice breaking when he said, ""they found us."" I watched as Nate buried his face in my bed sheets and continued to shake like crazy as tears streamed down his cheeks and he started sobbing again for what seemed like an eternity. He then said, ""They're going to kill me..."" with a quivering voice that made me start sobbing too for a couple minutes before I composed myself enough to try and talk to him again, but he wouldn't answer me until I touched him on the shoulder again. As soon as I did, he looked up at me with his eyes filled with tears and even more fear than they were before. Nate had never been afraid of anything in his entire life which made this look truly terrifying to see on this normally tough guy as if what ever happened between now and then had completely broken him and turned him into someone else entirely which made me wonder if I was even still talking to the same person anymore or not because it seemed that something had seriously changed inside of him while he was out there somehow or maybe it was something to do with this change that",0
"With supplies running low and tensions high, the group must work together to find a way out before it's too late.","was at the table. Jennifer leaned against the wall next to the door and waited. It had been several hours and it was finally dark outside, which meant it would be safer for her to go out. She checked her compass one more time before heading out into the forest.<br><br>Jennifer moved quickly through the woods towards the stream. The trees were thick here, and it was easy to get lost in them. Without any landmarks, she couldn’t tell whether or not she was going the right way.<br><br>She reached down and pulled her shirt up over her nose to block out the smell of mildew that still lingered in the air. Jennifer moved as quickly as she could, but it was slow going in the dark.<br><br>The last thing she needed was to run into another group of survivors and have to fight them for what little they had now. It would be better if she found the stream on her own and moved in that direction. It wasn’t likely that there would be another house nearby, but it was possible.<br><br>Jennifer moved silently through the trees, moving slowly and carefully so as not to make any sound. She was walking through a small clearing when she heard something move behind her. She moved faster, but it was too late.<br><br>The group moved to the house. Jennifer had already been there and knew how to get in, so she let the others go first. They moved quietly through the woods until they reached a small clearing where they could see the stream and an old house. The house was about three hundred yards away, but it was dark out and there were trees everywhere, so it was hard to tell exactly how far away it was.<br><br>Moving closer to the house, she moved quickly around the side of the house so that she could check for signs of life. She came around the house to find a small building in the back left corner. Walking towards it, Jennifer moved slowly so as not to attract any attention from anyone who might be inside. She moved up and peeked into the window, only to see a dim light.<br><br>Moving slowly up to the door, Jennifer carefully tried opening it, moving slowly at first then using more force after a moment. The door creaked open just enough for her to slip through the crack. Moving slowly into the house, she saw that it was made of some kind of metal and glass. There was a large table in the middle of the room with chairs surrounding it.  She could not tell if anyone was inside, but there were some supplies on the table that she wanted to look at.<br><br>She moved over to the table and put her backpack on the ground, then opened it so she could take out her flashlight. She moved the light around until she found a bottle of bleach,  three packs of beef jerky with 12 pieces in each pack, and a small bag of Doritos. The food would not last for the entire group for very long, but it would give them something to eat for the next couple of days.<br><br>Moving back to the door, she tried pushing on it but it would not budge. She tapped the door several times, hoping someone was inside who could help her get out. After several more minutes of no response, she decided that they must have gone out through another door in the house. Putting her backpack on again, she headed to the other side of the house to find  another exit.<br><br>She walked down the hallway and turned a corner, but saw that it was blocked by debris that had fallen from a hole in the ceiling. She moved around the pile of bricks and wood until she found a door with a handle. The door opened, but instead of another hallway she was looking at several piles of rubble that had collapsed onto themselves.<br><br>Stephanie climbed over them and continued her way down the hall when she heard someone coming down the stairs behind her. She turned and prepared to run, but instead of another hostile group she saw a man carrying two cases of bottled water. He was tall, skinny, and muscular with black hair, brown eyes, and multiple tattoos on his arms.<br><br>The group had gathered all the supplies they could carry from the house and were preparing to leave when a man ran into the house.

"Kitty confronts Sergei and eventually solves the case, bringing the murderer to justice.","as we got home from the dog park, I went straight to my computer. The computer was always being useful for me – it helped me out with all sorts of things and if I wanted to find out the truth about what was going on here then I was going to have to do everything that I could in order to put together a list of suspects.<br><br>But as I tried to move my cursor around, it seemed like something was wrong with the computer. For some reason, it just wasn't responding properly! I tried shutting it down and then turning it back on again, but this didn't work at all…it must have been broken somehow!<br><br>""What is happening?"" Mr Smith asked me as he watched me try and turn everything back on again. ""Is there a ghost in the computer?""<br><br>""I don't know,"" I replied, feeling completely helpless and just ready for this whole case to be over with. ""Our best bet is just to get a new computer altogether…""<br><br>When we finally got back into our car, Mr Smith looked at me with a very serious look on his face. ""Do you think that someone might have tampered with your computer?"" he asked slowly. ""Do you think they might be trying to stop us from investigating this case?""<br><br>I thought about it for a moment and then said, ""Well, it could be possible…I mean, we've been talking to a ton of people who might have had some kind of motive! It would be quite the coincidence if all of these people were having computer problems at the same time!""<br><br>Mr Smith nodded his head excitedly and said, ""If that's true then we're going to have to go talk to everyone again…we're going to have to go talk to Sergei Snipe!""<br><br>I knew that I was going to have a hard time facing Sergei again but I knew there was no other way. If we wanted any chance at solving this mystery then there was no way around it! I just hoped that he wasn't the one behind all of this!<br><br>Chapter 5<br><br>""Hello?"" Sergei said as he answered the door. He seemed surprised to see us back again – like he had expected us never to come back or something. Well, actually, he was probably hoping that we wouldn't come back…he probably didn't want us asking him any questions!<br><br>""Hello,"" Mr Smith said with a smile on his face. It seemed like he wasn't afraid of anything – certainly not Maurice Snipe. ""We just want to ask you a few more questions.""<br><br>""You want to ask me more questions?"" Sergei asked with a laugh. ""Well, I don't think I'm going to be of much help – I mean, I was in the dog park just like everyone else was and I had my eyes closed at the time of the murder. There's really no way that I could have seen anything.""<br><br>""I didn't say anything about the murder!"" Mr Smith said quickly. ""I don't even know if there was any sort of murder! All I said was that we wanted to ask you a few more questions. We're trying very hard to solve this case and bring an end to all of these deaths!""<br><br>Sergei seemed taken aback by this and he said, ""Well, alright then…come on in.""<br><br>Once inside, Sergei led us into his living room and invited us to sit down. ""So what is it that you would like to ask me?"" he asked with a sigh and a look on his face that it seems like he was dreading what we were going to say next.<br><br>""We've been looking into the backgrounds of everyone who was in the dog park at the time of the murder,"" Mr Smith said as he pulled out a notepad and a pen to take some notes. ""So far, we've found that everyone has a motive…except maybe you since you didn't see anything…""<br><br>""That's right,"" Sergei replied. ""And if I didn't see anything then there's really no reason to suspect me in anyway.""<br><br>""I'm not saying that you did it…"" Mr Smith said back. He seemed completely unfazed by this whole conversation which was surprising because Sergei looked like he was going to lose it on us at any moment.<br><br>Sergei looked like he had been expecting Mr Smith to say that he was guilty, so it was hard for him to believe what he did say instead. ""You don't mean that I might have been involved somehow?"" Sergei asked suspiciously.<br><br>""This is just idle talk,"" Mr Smith replied casually, as if nothing could phase him. ""I'm just saying that if you did see something – or if you saw anyone with any kind of weapon – then you need to come clean and let us know!""<br><br>Sergei looked shocked and said, ""I didn't see anything…and even if I did then why would I tell you?""<br><br>""Because it would make things easier on you,"" Mr Smith said casually. ""At this point though, I don't even know what to think anymore. I mean, Anita Martin seems to have a motive for everything – but she's also the only person in this whole case that doesn't have a motive.""<br><br>""Well, she was constantly doing that weird dance,"" Sergei replied. ""It could have just been her trying to distract everyone from seeing what the real murderer was up to.""<br><br>Mr Smith thought about this for a moment and he said, ""That isn't a bad theory…but then again it could still be true that she is the real murderer!""<br><br>""If that wasn't the case then why would everyone have lied on their statements?"" Sergei asked as he picked up his glass of water and took a sip. It seemed like he was trying to act calm but really he was really nervous about what we were saying. Even though he didn't do anything wrong, there's always the fear that someone might think you're guilty when you really aren't.<br><br>""We've",1

Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"<br><br>Jenna looked around her. The room was filled with several beds and the odd piece of equipment. There were curtains on most of the windows, but one was wide open and showed a brick wall outside. She looked back at Liam before speaking again. “What’s your name?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam smiled at that. “My name is Liam Cross, and I promise that I will not hurt you, no matter what anyone else tells you.”<br><br>Jenna thought about things for a few more seconds before asking another question. “Does everyone become a vampire? Is that what this is?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam shook his head. “Most people don’t become vampires, and it is definitely not something that you want to happen to you,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna looked at him curiously before asking a question that she had been thinking about for the last several minutes. “Where am I? How did I get here?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam stared at her for a moment. “You are in the hospital,” said Liam, answering her second question first. “The police found you in an alley.”<br><br>Jenna looked at him to make sure he was telling the truth. She looked at the room around her, and then back at Liam. “Where is everyone else? I don’t see anyone else here,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam smiled for a moment before shaking his head. “You’re the only person here, right now, but the police are looking for other people who might have been with you at the time of your attack that they might have left behind. You were there quite a while before they found you, and you’re very lucky to be alive,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna looked around the room again, and then back at him. “I don’t understand what happened to me, but I feel like it was more than being attacked and left for dead in an alley,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam nodded for a moment before speaking again. “You are right about that, although I don’t know everything about what happened either,” said Liam. He pulled his jacket out from where he kept it under the chair by his bed, and handed it to  her. “When we meet someone for the first time, as is customary in our kind of society, we give them something small as a token of trust. I hope this isn’t too much for you to carry around with you,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna took the jacket from him and slipped it on. It fit her perfectly, almost as if it was made for her. “No, not at all. Thank you,” said Jenna as she smiled and looked back at him.<br><br>He nodded for a few minutes before speaking again. “I want to tell you something else that might answer some questions you have,” said Liam. “When a vampire is about to change, we experience a few events that give us more insight into what is coming. You were probably going through this and may have not realized it, or just forgot about it. When I saw you in the alley, I knew exactly who you were and what had just happened to you,” said Liam as he leaned back more comfortably into his chair.<br><br>Jenna leaned forward slightly in her seat as she listened intently to what he was saying. She took a moment to think about what he said and decided to ask him a question as she leaned back in her chair. “In other words, you knew I was going to turn into a vampire,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam looked up at the ceiling for a few seconds, and then looked back at her. “Yes, that is sort of what I’m saying. We all go through this when we are about to change,” he said as he looked back over at the front door.<br><br>Jenna shifted her eyes from one side of the room to another as she thought about how Elijah Sedgew ick might take what Liam was saying. She turned to look at the clock on the wall as she realized that it was late, and Elijah would be coming in soon if he wasn’t there already.<br><br>She turned away from the clock and back at Liam, who was still watching her carefully. “Where did you say you met each other?” asked Jenna as she shifted her weight in the chair.<br><br>“We met on the train to New York,” he said with a slight nod of his head. “I had just gotten on board and sat down in a seat next to you, as I was already quite tired from the trip up from Virginia. When I sat down you turned to look at me, and then took your phone out of your pocket and started typing away.”<br><br>Jenna listened as Liam spoke about their first meeting, but was having trouble picturing it in her mind. “Wait a minute,” she said as she looked at the clock and then back at Liam. “Are you saying that I got on this train by myself? When you first walked in here, I thought that I had been taken over by a vampire or something.”<br><br>Liam nodded. “Yes, and I know why you would think that. It is one of the things that leads up to a vampire’s transformation. They feel as if they are not traveling alone and have company with them on their journey, but when they look around they realize that no one else is there.”<br><br>Jenna nodded her head slowly trying to absorb everything Liam was telling her. “So that’s why I thought there was someone else in here with me?”<br><br>He nodded again. “It is possible because you were heading to New York, and I know that Antonia Rossi lives in New York. She is a very powerful vampire. She is the only person right now who holds the allegiance of most of the vampires in this country. She holds sway over a large number of vampires, both here and abroad. Every vampire who has turned to her for protection has been transformed into her kind. You have to go to New York and find her. She will be able to help you.”<br><br>Jenna moved away from the door, turning her back on Liam as she slid down until she was sitting on the floor in front of one of the seats. “New York ? What about Liam? I thought he was going with me.”<br><br>He shook his head solemnly. “I wish that I could, Jenna, but I can’t. Antonia is very powerful and has vast connections to all sorts of dark forces. If she finds out about me, then they will know that I am here. There wouldn’t be any point in traveling to NYC and going to her if she finds out that I am here. She would come looking for me immediately and, in the process, she would kill you.”<br><br>Jenna closed her eyes as she sighed heavily with resignation. “What’s the connection between Damian Henchman and Antonia? Why is he important to her?”<br><br>Liam looked at Jenna with a solemn expression as he said, “Damian is a vampire who has been to Italy recently. I think that you should go to Italy and find out if there are any clues to help you about your attacker. You could try New York first, but I think that it would be better if you went to Italy because it is less far away. Plus, it is closer to home for you",1

Trevor had lured her out to his home under false pretenses with the hopes that she would sleep with him. Natalie figured that he might have been trying to rape her, since she was stuck out in the middle of nowhere with no means of escape and a man who wanted to hurt her.<br><br>After a few weeks, Natalie moved to a city close by. She never told anyone about what Trevor Lockwood had done to her, not even her closest friends. She was ashamed of what had happened to her and she thought people would think less of her if they knew that she had slept with a man in order to get money. She had played Trevor Lockwood and now she felt like he was playing her, this time by trying to lure her into his home where he could kill her.<br><br>Natalie Harper’s home was a modest one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of a city. She had moved to the city so that she could get a job at a grocery store closer to her home.<br><br>She moved in with some friends from her hometown, but three months later she found herself living alone again due to disagreements over money and rent with her roommates. She had found the apartment after being referred there by  the manager at a local grocery store where she worked.<br><br>Natalie had been working as a cashier at the grocery store for about two months when she ran into Trevor Lockwood again, who wanted to set up another meeting with her. Natalie declined. Trevor persisted, sending Natalie emails that were rude and pushy.<br><br>Eventually Natalie changed her mind, realizing that she needed the money to pay her bills. Trevor Lockwood had offered her a job working as a model for his modeling agency. She was reluctant at first but decided to give it a try because it paid well and she would be able to quit her job at the grocery store, which Natalie realized that she didn’t care much for.<br><br>Natalie agreed to meet Trevor Lockwood at a local restaurant and discuss the offer in person.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was a handsome young man with bright eyes and short dark hair. He was about twenty-seven years old Natalie guessed, though she couldn’t be sure. Trevor Lockwood had a confident air about him. He was very persuasive and knew how to work people, Natalie observed. And he seemed like he could be dangerous if provoked, she thought. He definitely wasn’t someone she wanted to cross. But  the money sounded too good to pass up.<br><br>When Natalie arrived at the restaurant, Trevor Lockwood was already sitting at a table, alone. He greeted her with a smile and some small talk about the weather. It was unusually cold and snowing outside for this time of year. Natalie pulled aside her coat to  reveal a tight black dress underneath. The dress was mostly sheer and showed off Natalie’s ample cleavage.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood smiled appreciatively, his eyes taking in every inch of Natalie’s body, lingering on her breasts. After glancing down at her cleavage a few more times Natalie finally pulled the coat back over her chest and pretended to be interested in a news article she had retrieved from the check-stand rack. Trevor Lockwood’s eyes kept darting back to Natalie’s chest, his face flushed with arousal.<br><br>Natalie looked up at Trevor Lockwood and smiled coyly, knowing that she was getting to him. Trevor Lockwood responded by scooting closer to her on the bench seat of his booth. Natalie moved back slightly so that their knees weren’t touching and waited for Trevor Lockwood to continue.<br><br>After some more small talk about Natalie struggling to make rent",1
Shannon's paintings begin to take on a life of their own and Shannon starts to feel like her paintings are her new family.,"the paintings were talking to her, and she responded back through them. When she felt close to someone, Shannon would often give her paintings as gifts and tell people that they were her family.<br><br>Shannon continued to paint and show her paintings around town, and people began to notice them. She was invited by various places to have an exhibit of her paintings, and she started to make a little money from selling them. This made her very proud.<br><br>Shannon’s uncle saw how much she enjoyed painting and helped to build a small studio in the attic of their house for her. She soon filled up the studio with paintings, and it became very crowded.<br><br>Katie Matthews was now a friend of Shannon’s, and she also painted. Katie didn’t think she was very good at painting but felt inspired by Shannon Daniels who encouraged her to draw and paint whenever she could. They often painted together when they were at each other’s houses.<br><br>Shannon continued her journey as an artist, and she entered a variety of exhibits. Her paintings became recognizable throughout the town, and people often stopped to look at them when they passed by.<br><br>Shannon’s paintings became popular enough that she was able to make a living from them. Her uncle helped her rent a small office in town where she sold her paintings.<br><br>She continued to enter art shows, and now even her painting teacher had heard of her and asked if she would show some of her paintings in an exhibit on campus for students who were interested in pursuing careers in the arts.<br><br>Katie Matthews entered the art show with Shannon Daniels, and they both displayed many of their paintings. They talked to each other about how much fun it was to see their works hanging on the walls at the art show.<br><br>One evening after all the exhibits were closed for the night, Shannon and Katie were looking at the gallery one last time. They were admiring their work when they noticed someone standing in the shadows staring at their paintings. Shannon and Katie quickly moved over to the entrance of the exhibit so that they could get a better look at who was standing there.<br><br>“Who are you?” asked Shannon.<br><br>The man stepped into the light and said, “I’m sorry. I just wanted to come by and see your paintings, but I didn’t mean to disturb you. Some of these paintings are really good, and the  one you have hanging up over there is especially beautiful.” The man pointed at Shannon’s favorite painting—a large red rose with green leaves and a red ribbon tied around it.<br><br>“Thank you for the compliment,” said Shannon. “Are you an artist?”<br><br>The man took a closer look at Shannon’s favorite painting, then he smiled. “You caught me. I’m Rosemary Jacobs, and I teach art at the high school here in town.”<br><br>Shannon felt compelled to tell Rosemary about her mother’s art class, and how much the painting meant to her. “I think my mom painted this, but she passed away a couple of years ago from cancer. It was the last thing she gave me before she died and it means so much to me.”<br><br>A look of compassion and concern washed over Rosemary’s face. “I’m sorry Shannon; I didn’t mean to bring up painful memories. I just wanted to say that you have beautiful talent, and I think your paintings are amazing. You should show these at the art festival next month.”<br><br>Shannon was moved by Rosemary’s kindness, and she really enjoyed talking to her. “Thank you, again, Rosemary. I’ll think about it. I appreciate all the compliments on my art work, but I haven’t shown anyone else what I’ve painted. This is my first painting class. My mom gave me some paints years ago, but I never really used them. She said they were hers when she was younger and she thought that I might enjoy them. So, I decided to pick up a brush and try it out for myself,” Shannon finished.<br><br>“I think you should share what you have created with others. I think it would be so great if you could enter your artwork into the art festival next month, “Rosemary said enthusiastically.<br><br>“I think I could do that, Rosemary. But I’m moving soon to a new house with my dad and Uncle John, and I really couldn’t paint in my new house. My old studio is in my attic, and it is pretty cramped up there. It would be such a mess if I tried to paint there. My dad suggested I contact  someone who had an office for rent. So, I rented the one you found for me, and now I can paint there.”<br><br>“That is wonderful! You are so talented and creative. What you create is beautiful, Shannon! You could have a really successful art career.” Rosemary was very excited about Shannon’s future career as an artist.<br><br>Shannon smiled, “I doubt that, Rosemary. But if it happens, that would really be great! I think Katie should enter her artwork into the exhibit too. We both would enjoy it so much, and I think our paintings would look nice hanging next to each other.”<br><br>Rosemary smiled, “I agree that would be a wonderful idea. Let’s call up Katie and ask her to enter the show.”<br><br>Shannon had forgotten all about the conversation with Uncle Jeff about entering her artwork into the art festival, which Shannon and Rosemary had planned to do that afternoon.<br><br>Rosemary hung up the phone and said, “Shannon, I have some exciting news. I just called over to talk to your Uncle Jeff and he said that you can submit your artwork for the art gallery show at college. Shannon, that is so exciting!”<br><br>Shannon was excited too. The prospect of having her artwork in a show was thrilling to her. “Wow, I am so glad you told me about it, Rosemary! Now I know what to do with all those pictures I have in my attic. Shannon’s attic was full of boxes filled with canvases. There were large canvases stacked on top of smaller canvases that were stacked on top of more boxes. There were paintings of all shapes and sizes in the boxes. Some were framed and others were not, but all of them had the same signature in the bottom corner. Shannon thought she recognized the signature. She thought it was her mother’s.<br><br>Shannon moved a box out from in front of her, so she could see better. The signature said: Shannon Daniels and below that was written: 1996-2009. Shannon wiped away tears and smiled. “I can’t believe my mom painted these pictures of me! They must have been painted when I was three years old, because I remember that is when my mom said I got paint on my dress and then on my hair too. I wonder why she never showed them  to me when I was a little girl?”<br><br>Rosemary looked at the canvases with Shannon. “I don’t know why she never showed you these paintings when you were smaller, but maybe now that you are older, you will be able to appreciate them more.”",1
Shannon's paintings begin to take on a life of their own and Shannon starts to feel like her paintings are her new family.,"the paintings were talking to her, and she responded back through them. When she felt close to someone, Shannon would often give her paintings as gifts and tell people that they were her family.<br><br>Shannon continued to paint and show her paintings around town, and people began to notice them. She was invited by various places to have an exhibit of her paintings, and she started to make a little money from selling them. This made her very proud.<br><br>Shannon’s uncle saw how much she enjoyed painting and helped to build a small studio in the attic of their house for her. She soon filled up the studio with paintings, and it became very crowded.<br><br>Katie Matthews was now a friend of Shannon’s, and she also painted. Katie didn’t think she was very good at painting but felt inspired by Shannon Daniels who encouraged her to draw and paint whenever she could. They often painted together when they were at each other’s houses.<br><br>Shannon continued her journey as an artist, and she entered a variety of exhibits. Her paintings became recognizable throughout the town, and people often stopped to look at them when they passed by.<br><br>Shannon’s paintings became popular enough that she was able to make a living from them. Her uncle helped her rent a small office in town where she sold her paintings.<br><br>She continued to enter art shows, and now even her painting teacher had heard of her and asked if she would show some of her paintings in an exhibit on campus for students who were interested in pursuing careers in the arts.<br><br>Katie Matthews entered the art show with Shannon Daniels, and they both displayed many of their paintings. They talked to each other about how much fun it was to see their works hanging on the walls at the art show.<br><br>One evening after all the exhibits were closed for the night, Shannon and Katie were looking at the gallery one last time. They were admiring their work when they noticed someone standing in the shadows staring at their paintings. Shannon and Katie quickly moved over to the entrance of the exhibit so that they could get a better look at who was standing there.<br><br>“Who are you?” asked Shannon.<br><br>The man stepped into the light and said, “I’m sorry.

Jennifer decides to leave her family and start a new life.,"Well, your daddy and I are getting divorced. You won’t live with us anymore - not right now. Mama will look after you for awhile.”<br><br>Lily twisted around on Jennifer’s lap to look up into her eyes. Her dark brown eyes were full of concern and confusion. “But, but where will we live?”<br><br>“You and me, baby girl - just you and me. We have our own house now.” Jennifer laughed awkwardly, wiping away tears that had begun to form in her eyes again. “Mama has a new job, too.”<br><br>Lily was confused. She didn’t understand what Jennifer was saying. “Where are we going to live? We don’t have a house – not yet. Are we going to live in an apartment?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled, then took a deep breath before she filled them in. “No honey,” she began. “We bought our own house. You know how much I told you I wanted a backyard for the two of us? Well, I got it! We now live in a cul-de-sac, right by the park. It’s a real pretty neighborhood with lots of trees. We even have a swing in our front yard to play on.”<br><br>Lily was starting to understand what Jennifer was talking about, but something still didn’t add up. “Mama, I don’t understand. You said we were going to live at Grandma Jackie’s house.”<br><br>Lily sat up straight and looked at her mama with tear-filled eyes. “Can’t we go to Grandma Jackie? I like it there. What about the park? Can we still go to the park?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled, trying to hide her own tears. “Of course we can! We just don’t live in the same house anymore. We are still a family, just a different kind of family. I still love you as much as ever.”<br><br>Lily nodded and wiped her eyes. “I know, mama,” she started. “It’s just that I didn’t think daddy would do something like that. It was all so sudden, too. Now he won ’t even talk to me.”<br><br>Jennifer put her arm around Lily and pulled her close. “He probably doesn’t know what to say. You should try talking to him some more. I bet he wants you as much as ever. It takes time to get used to the changes.”<br><br>Lily pulled away and looked at Jennifer with a questioning face. “What changes?” she asked, her tone turning sarcastic. “You mean when daddy sells the old house and mama moves out?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled. “Maybe we can still come over and visit,” she said, moving toward the door.<br><br>Jennifer opened the door and moved into the hallway. She turned back to look at her daughter and smiled warmly. “Yes! You can move in with me for a while,” she said, trying to sound optimistic.  “I have a new job and you can go to the same school, and we’ll see how it goes. You might like living with me just as much.”<br><br>Lily shrugged. She had never liked change, but didn’t really have an opinion on this one way or another. “I guess so,” she said doubtfully. But her expression clearly showed her reluctance if Jennifer had looked closely enough.<br><br>Jennifer stepped out the door and walked down the stairs to the sidewalk below. The moving van was parked in front of her house, ready to take her furniture away. She turned back toward the side of the house and waved at her daughter, who was standing there with a group of children.<br><br>“Good-bye!” Jennifer called. Then she turned and moved to the front door across the street, where a middle-aged man stood waiting on the porch.<br><br>“Are you moving in?” the man asked.<br><br>“Yes, I am,” Jennifer answered. “You are moving out?”<br><br>“Yes, I am, too. You don’t look familiar. Are you moving to this neighborhood?”<br><br>“No, I moved from one street over, but I just started a new job and decided to move closer. Moving is such a hassle!”<br><br>The moving man laughed lightly. “I know what you mean. But at least it will be easier moving the rest of your stuff. Moving the big pieces is the worst part.”<br><br>“That’s true, but I want to move all my furniture to the new house today instead of dragging it here tomorrow and back again on Wednesday,” Jennifer said. “This way, I can unpack right away. Do you move furniture often?”<br><br>“Every couple of months. I moved a lot when I was younger, but now I prefer to stay in one place for years at a time. It saves me money, and it gives me more stability with my job. My wife prefers the same thing because moving is hard on the relationship. But it depends on our jobs. We move more when we get transferred to another city or state. Moving is such a hassle, but the longer you stay in one place the harder it is to move on short notice. It can be hard finding a new place if you have to move  quickly.”<br><br>The moving man stopped and picked up a picture frame. He was looking at Jennifer’s pictures of Samantha and Theresa as children, then he replaced the frame on the wall.<br><br>“Yeah, we have two kids, so we may move again in the next few years,” Jennifer said. “But we probably won’t move for a while after this, unless my husband gets transferred again. He’s not getting any younger, so who knows? It’s just nice to not have to move right now. I need some stability after everything that has happened.”<br><br>The moving man smiled and nodded his head in agreement.<br><br>“Moving is a hassle, but at least you can choose where to put everything in the new place. I don’t move very often, but when I do, it is fun to rearrange my stuff and make the place feel more like home. Moving is definitely stressful though. It’s hard to make friends if you move too often because it takes people longer to get to know you.”<br><br>The moving man grunted in response.<br><br>“Some people move all the time, and have a different group of friends at each place they move to. That way, they don’t really have to make any new friends. They already have a group of friends waiting for them wherever they go. That way, they don’t have to go through what you just did. They can move quickly from one place to the next. Moving is easier that way, especially if you have a big family. You can’t move so quickly when you are only moving some of your things, or when you are just moving yourself. Moving can be really easy if you plan ahead. It can also be hard though if you don’t plan ahead, or things don’t go according to your plan. Moving can be a hassle and stressful at times, but it can also be a lot of fun. You just have to know how to dealwith moving stress and keep things from getting too overwhelming.”<br><br>Another moving man came out of the house. He carried a small wooden table and two dining chairs to a nearby truck.<br><br>The moving man, Jennifer, and the other moving men stood at the side of the house as they continued to load and unload boxes from the truck. They moved quickly but carefully , keeping the tables and couches from hitting the walls or scratching the floors. They managed to fit all of Jennifer’s furniture into her small SUV, which had been loaded to the roof with boxes only moments before.<br><br>“Don’t worry, my friend. Everyone has their own methods for moving. If you think it is the right way to do things, then you keep doing it that way. If you want to make sure that everything gets put into place exactly how you want it, then that is what you do. It’s all about figuring out how your mind works and what works best for you. As long as it keeps working and you don’t keep moving, then you have a good way of doing things!”<br><br>The moving men smiled and nodded at Jennifer. They moved to the back of the truck and finished loading all of the furniture. The moving men packed everything into the truck with incredible skill and expert timing.<br><br>Jennifer moved to the passenger’s side of the SUV and picked up her bags. She walked back to side the house and noticed that three of the moving men were busy carrying box after box into the house, while a fourth was watching them from side a doorway. The moving man turned to watch Jennifer get into the side of the SUV.<br><br>“Hey! Why don’t you move in with us? We have some extra space right now and it would be nice to have another girl around. You can move in with us for as long as you need to, and we can move you into a different room when someone else needs to move in. We’re moving into a huge apartment later on and we don’t know anyone else yet. We’ll make sure that you are taken care of, okay?”<br><br>Moving men moved to back of the truck, and got into their side. They drove off towards the other end of the block, moving their way through traffic. Moving men had already done their previous moves and were heading to side their next move. Moving men were moving a lot today and had many moves lined up.<br><br>Jennifer moved back to side the door and thought for a moment.<br><br>This is Side Bar. This is where Jennifer will make her decision regarding moving in with the three moving men.<br><br>“I don’t know,” she said. “It sounds like a lot of responsibility. I don’t want to be a burden.”<br><br>“Don’t worry about it, we can handle it. Just say yes and come with us!”<br><br>Jennifer thought for a moment longer and then made her decision.<br><br>“Yes, I’ll move in with you.",1
"Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.","else where it is warm and has green fields?”<br><br>Jack shrugged his shoulders. “It’s just the first place that came to mind, Eliza. I don’t want to be here anymore. It reminds me of you too much, and I can’t stand the thought of that.”<br><br>Eliza moved closer to him again.<br><br>“It reminds you of me? You know, Jack, I may be dead, but I can still feel your touch on my skin. I can still feel our bodies pressing together and how strong you were when you made love to me.”<br><br>Jack moved closer to her again, as close as the grave would allow him, and looked into her eyes.<br><br>Jack stared at her for a long moment before saying anything to her. He could feel his heart beat faster as he looked into her beautiful blue eyes and listened to her soft voice.<br><br>“I moved to this place because of you, Eliza. I can’t be here anymore because it is where you died, and that is where I will always remember you. That is where everyone will remember you, and nothing could be more painful than that.”<br><br>Eliza moved her cheek to Jack’s hand while he was still speaking, and she moved her body so that they were pressed against each other.<br><br>“Moving to a new place won’t lessen the pain of losing me, Jack. It won’t make our memories fade away. Moving to a new place – anywhere – will only be a way for you to forget me.”<br><br>Jack moved his hand away from Eliza’s cheek and he placed it on the top of her gravestone. “Moving will be a way for me to get my life back,” he said as he moved his other hand to the gravestone on the other side of Eliza’s grave. “Moving is a way for us to be together again.”<br><br>Eliza could tell that Jack was getting upset with her and she moved her head away from his hand so that she could move to the other side of the gravestone. “It will never be like it used to be,” she said.<br><br>Jack moved closer to Eliza so that they were standing right next to each other once again. “Moving will make it better,” he said as  he reached out to hold her hand.<br><br>Eliza could feel the warmth coming from Jack’s body as his hand reached for hers and she pulled away from him before they touched. “I don’t want you to forget me, Jack,” she said. “I love you and I need you.”<br><br>Jack tried to talk to Eliza once again, but she didn’t say anything and he turned his head so that he could see her face as she looked at him coldly.<br><br>“You just need to get on with your life, Jack,” she said as she took a step away from him. “This is all I can do for you now.”<br><br>Jack tried to talk to her again but Eliza didn’t say anything and she disappeared before he could get a good look at her face. Jack tried to grasp for her hand but she was gone and he stared at the spot where she had stood, trying to understand what was going on.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost had been standing right next to Jack in the graveyard when she spoke to him, but there was no sign of her when he looked  around. He knew that she had gone somewhere because he could feel her presence, but he couldn’t see her any longer.<br><br>Jack walked around the gravestones and looked carefully amongst the grass as if Eliza would suddenly appear and tell him that none of this was real and that he had been dreaming all of it. He couldn’t find Eliza anywhere and she didn’t say anything as he searched, but she did nothing to stop him either.<br><br>It was clear to him that she couldn’t see him any more either. She looked like a ghost to everyone else, but her eyes were open and her ghostly appearance wasn’t accompanied by a translucent white glow like what he had seen in Halloween movies. She was just invisible to everyone except for Jack.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack walked around the graveyard, but he could tell that she was happy with how things had turned out. Eliza’s ghost had been one of the nicest ghosts that he ever knew, and it was wonderful to see her again. She deserved a happy ending and so did he. She didn’t say anything at all during their time in the graveyard. <br><br>Jack watched her for a while longer and then he went over to his car. There was a lot that he wanted to do in the days ahead, but there was also a lot of unfinished business that had to be taken care of before that could happen. Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack got into his car, but she was looking at him again.<br><br>Jack wanted to tell her how much he appreciated what she had done for him after he had lost her. He wanted to thank her and ask her if there was any way that she could finish the job so that he wouldn’t have to let go. Jack wanted to tell her that she had done enough and that it was time for him to move on with the rest of his life. He wanted Eliza’s ghost to know that she didn’t have to be invisible any longer, and that she didn’t have to let go.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Eliza, please don’t leave me alone. Let go of me!”<br><br>Eliza said nothing at all.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Let go of me! Let me go! Let go! Please let me go!”<br><br>Jack tried to hold on to her, but she was gone.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost told him not to fight it and asked Jack to let go of what he was holding onto and then move on with his life. Jack asked her why, and Eliza told Jack that she wanted him to let go so that she could finally let go of him.<br><br>Jack’s ghost told Eliza that he didn’t want to move on. He didn’t want to let go of her. He didn’t want to live his  life without her. Eliza asked Jack what he would do if she stayed.<br><br>Jack said to her, “I want you to stay.” He wanted some sort of assurance that the ghost in front of him was really there, and so he asked her to repeat the question.  More quietly this time, she asked again if he wanted her to stay. When Eliza repeated the question a third time, Jack said that he did want her to stay, and so she told him that if he really wanted her to stay then she would.<br><br>Jack took a step toward the gravestone and then stopped. Eliza’s grave, Jack thought with the sudden realization of what he was doing. He was going to visit Eliza’s grave. He wasn’t visiting her body; he was visiting her grave. He was burying her all over again, this time without a body to bury. Jack took another step toward Eliza’s grave and started to weep. “Please don’t go,” he said choking on his words. “Please don’t leave me. Please stay with me. Don’t go away again. Please don’t go away .”<br><br>Eliza said that she wouldn’t leave him and that she would never go away again, but Jack was already moving toward the gravestone. He stopped when he got there and slowly walked around the gravestone looking for her whistle, which Eliza always wore around her neck. With each whistle he blew, Jack felt a hole opening up in his chest.<br><br>Jack found Eliza’s whistle under a rose bush that grew by the gravestone. He picked the rose petals off of it and blew the whistle several times, but when he stopped blowing, he felt empty again. <br><br>Jack blew the whistle one last time and put it in his pocket. The whistle was cold in his hand, and it felt heavy with Eliza’s absence. Jack wiped the tears from his face, put on his coat and left the graveyard feeling as if all hope had been drained from him. He sat down on a park bench and looked up at the winter sky. Jack couldn’t stop thinking about Eliza, but he knew that she was right. It was time for him to let go of his past and move on with his life. But it didn’t mean that he had to like it.<br><br>Jack blew the whistle one more time, and then he put it in his pocket and left the park. He walked for a few blocks until he came to a small flower shop on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street and went inside. Jack bought mums, gardenias, geraniums, and roses and took them back to Eliza’s grave. He arranged the flowers around the base of the headstone and then sat down on the ground and leaned against it.<br><br>Jack stayed there until it started to get dark, and then he got up and brushed the dirt off of his hands. He looked at the headstone one last time and then turned and walked away.",1

She was just invisible to everyone except for Jack.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack walked around the graveyard, but he could tell that she was happy with how things had turned out. Eliza’s ghost had been one of the nicest ghosts that he ever knew, and it was wonderful to see her again. She deserved a happy ending and so did he. She didn’t say anything at all during their time in the graveyard. <br><br>Jack watched her for a while longer and then he went over to his car. There was a lot that he wanted to do in the days ahead, but there was also a lot of unfinished business that had to be taken care of before that could happen. Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack got into his car, but she was looking at him again.<br><br>Jack wanted to tell her how much he appreciated what she had done for him after he had lost her. He wanted to thank her and ask her if there was any way that she could finish the job so that he wouldn’t have to let go. Jack wanted to tell her that she had done enough and that it was time for him to move on with the rest of his life. He wanted Eliza’s ghost to know that she didn’t have to be invisible any longer, and that she didn’t have to let go.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Eliza, please don’t leave me alone. Let go of me!”<br><br>Eliza said nothing at all.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Let go of me! Let me go! Let go! Please let me go!”<br><br>Jack tried to hold on to her, but she was gone.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost told him not to fight it and asked Jack to let go of what he was holding onto and then move on with his life. Jack asked her why, and Eliza told Jack that she wanted him to let go so that she could finally let go of him.<br><br>Jack’s ghost told Eliza that he didn’t want to move on. He didn’t want to let go of her. He didn’t want to live his  life without her. Eliza asked Jack what he would do if she stayed.<br><br>Jack said to her, “I want you to stay.” He wanted some sort of assurance that the ghost in front of him was really there, and so he asked her to repeat the question.  More quietly this time, she asked again if he wanted her to stay. When Eliza repeated the question a third time, Jack said that he did want her to stay, and so she told him that if he really wanted her to stay then she would.<br><br>Jack took a step toward the gravestone and then stopped. Eliza’s grave, Jack thought with the sudden realization of what he was doing. He was going to visit Eliza’s grave. He wasn’t visiting her body; he was visiting her grave. He was burying her all over again, this time without a body to bury. Jack took another step toward Eliza’s grave and started to weep. “Please don’t go,” he said choking on his words. “Please don’t leave me. Please stay with me. Don’t go away again. Please don’t go away .”<br><br>Eliza said that she wouldn’t leave him and that she would never go away again, but Jack was already moving toward the gravestone. He stopped when he got there and slowly walked around the gravestone looking for her whistle, which Eliza always wore around her neck. With each whistle he blew, Jack felt a hole opening up in his chest.<br><br>Jack found Eliza’s whistle under a rose bush that grew by the gravestone. He picked the rose petals off of it and blew the whistle several times, but when he stopped blowing, he felt empty again. <br><br>Jack blew the whistle one last time and put it in his pocket. The whistle was cold in his hand, and it felt heavy with Eliza’s absence. Jack wiped the tears from his face, put on his coat and left the graveyard feeling as if all hope had been drained from him. He sat down on a park bench and looked up at the winter sky. Jack couldn’t stop thinking about Eliza, but he knew that she was right. It was time for him to let go of his past and move on with his life. But it didn’t mean that he had to like it.<br><br>Jack blew the whistle one more time, and then he put it in his pocket and left the park. He walked for a few blocks until he came to a small flower shop on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street and went inside. Jack bought mums, gardenias, geraniums, and roses and took them back to Eliza’s grave. He arranged the flowers around the base of the headstone and then sat down on the ground and leaned against it.<br><br>Jack stayed there until it started to get dark, and then he got up and brushed the dirt off of his hands. He looked at the headstone one last time and then turned and walked away.",1
"Shannon lands her first major assignment, a feature on the inner city, but quickly discovers that the ugly reality of life in the city is far different from the dream she imagined.",". Shannon decided that this woman might be a good person to interview.<br><br>When Shannon introduced herself and asked the woman if she would be willing to talk to her, the woman responded rudely, saying she did not have time for interviews because she had to have her bottle of beer filled before noon so that she could get some sleep.<br><br>Shannon was amazed at the woman’s casual response to questions about crime, and decided she had to ask more questions. She told the woman that she was a reporter from the local paper trying to find out what people were talking about in the inner city. She asked if there was anything in particular on the news that the woman would like to talk about. The woman responded by saying, “Nothing is going on here but a bunch of fools and liars. Nothing else is going on here other than crime, ignorance, and stupidity.”<br><br>Shannon then asked what news reports the woman wanted to discuss. The woman said there were none because there were no news reports in the newspaper, because reporters did not care about people in the inner city.<br><br>At this point Shannon moved on to another subject, asking if there were any stories that she should cover. The woman responded, “In the news? Are you joking with me? News about how black people are being screwed over? How we have to drink piss water from a fountain? How we have to use our hands as toilets when there is no public restroom in sight? How we don’t have a say-so in our local and national government? News on the news? Do you think some white reporter will tell black people what’s happening in their own lives? Do you think if you tell us what the white man is trying to do to us that we are going to be glad that you told us ? News on the news?”<br><br>The woman continued, “You’re right. We don’t have anything to talk about because there is nothing happening here. Things are at a standstill, and nobody cares. Nobody in the inner city seems to care about anything, so how can you expect a reporter to write about us? So, no, I don’t have anything for you.”<br><br>Harsh words from the young woman. Shannon listened attentively and then thanked her for her time. She was not deterred by the woman’s hostile tone. Shannon moved on  to the next interview.<br><br>“I want to talk about the high crime rate in your neighborhood,” Shannon said in a soft voice to the middle-aged man with a stubbly beard and unkempt hair.<br><br>“What high crime rate?” he responded, surprised and defiant.<br><br>Shannon looked around. It was obvious that the surrounding residents did not find the question shocking at all. She knew that whatever she found here would be different from what she had imagined, but this was far beyond anything she could have expected.<br><br>“Are there gang fights in this neighborhood?” Shannon continued.<br><br>“Only when the other neighborhoods come over here, but that doesn’t happen very often. That only happens once in a while. That ain’t high crime rates, that’s just plain old lowdown fighting. It ain’t high crime when the city lets the other neighborhoods run all over this neighborhood and do what they want to do here. That ain’t no high crime rate. That is just plain old ugly and nasty. Nobody cares about that here, because nobody cares about us no how, not even our own folks. They say everybody is equal",1
Valerie makes it to safety and the police catch John Doe.,"a tight left turn as soon as she reached the stairs.<br><br>John Doe had thought that he would have been able to see Valerie Marx from the side of the house before then, but he had been wrong about that. There was no one in sight when Valerie ran away from him. This was a bad situation for Valerie because John Doe knew that she was in trouble. Her chances of surviving the night were slim to none, and John Doe had no intention of letting her get away with her life, so he decided that there was no point in following her.<br><br>Valerie Marx had successfully escaped from John Doe, but she wasn ’t safe yet because he could catch up with her at any moment. The police were just around the corner, and she was walking towards them even though she didn’t see them. It only took a few minutes for her to reach the police station since it was only a block away from her house, but John Doe could have easily caught up with her by then if he was able to move as fast as he did before, which would allow him to be close enough to kill her when she reached the police station.<br><br>Valerie Marx did not see the police when she arrived at the station because they were around a corner and around a car. This was good for John Doe because he had less of a chance of being spotted by them as long as he kept moving to the right side of the police station. It was also good for him because it gave him more time to think about what should be done next.<br><br>The police station might have been safe for Valerie, but it was not a safe place for John Doe to be because they would be able to easily see him if he went inside. They might have also been able to find out who he was from the information that he left behind in the basement. If they were  able to do that, then he might have ended up being under more suspicion than before. Because of those reasons, it was better for him to just keep running for now and wait until things cooled off before taking another victim.<br><br>If Valerie Marx walked inside the police station, then she would be safe from John Doe for now because the police would surround her and keep her from harm. On the other hand, Valerie did not want to go into the police station because she had more important places to go.<br><br>Male Celebrity A was not at the police station when Valerie Marx arrived there because he had gone to Valerie’s house to make sure she was safe. When Valerie arrived at her house, Male Celebrity A was already there. He took Valerie inside her house and locked the door so that John Doe could not get in. Male Celebrity A talked with Valerie while they were inside her home and comforted her as she went through what had just happened to her.<br><br>Valerie was glad when Male Celebrity A arrived because she had been starting to feel alone and scared after moving house and changing jobs. She explained everything that happened in the basement to Male Celebrity A, including how she got there and why she was moving house. She told Male Celebrity A how scared she had been and how she was moving house because of the situation with John Doe, but also because her old apartment building was right next to an old graveyard. Valerie was in a bad way because moving house like that would make anyone feel alone, and she needed someone to support her through that kind of ordeal. <br><br>Male Celebrity A listened to everything Valerie said without saying anything for a long time. After he finished listening, he said that Valerie had done a brave thing when she went into the basement to confront John Doe.<br><br>Male Celebrity A was very happy when he heard what Valerie had done. He did not think it would be brave to visit a murderer in a dark basement, but Male Celebrity A knew that Valerie had wanted to do that and was happy that she did.<br><br>Male Celebrity A told Valerie that she was very brave because she had stood up to the killer after waking up tied up, without being able to move or speak. He said that it was a very scary thing to do, but she had done it and was safe now.<br><br>Valerie Marx was happy to hear what Male Celebrity A said. It made her feel better about herself and the situation.",1
The townspeople start to turn on each other as the visions become more violent.,"<br><br>""She's....spent too long in there..."" Another voice says. ""We must act now...her body will soon fall into the hands of the spirits...""<br><br>""No! I promised to keep her safe! I promised she wouldn't fall into their hands..."" The man tells them; his face looks so sad. ""I promised her father I would keep her safe…I will not break my promise...even if she is gone to us forever…"" The man says; his voice sounds so broken…so tired.<br><br>""If we act now...at least we have a chance at saving her life."" A deeper voice enters the fray; it sounds almost malevolent in nature yet there seems to be a hint of compassion in its words as well.<br><br>""No!"" The man says as he stands up, looking down at me with concerned eyes. ""You can't save her! You don't know what you are doing!"" He shouts at them. ""You'll only kill her!"" He shouts again, his face looking like he is about to cry.<br><br>I look him over once more; his face seems so familiar, almost like a part of my own... But where do I know him from? Why do I feel so connected to him? Why do I care about him so much?<br><br>""Please...My child..."" He says again, his voice gentle and soft. ""Wake up...I will not let them take you..."" He says as he brushes my hair away from my face before leaning down and kissing me on the forehead.<br><br>I try to move; I try to reach out and touch his hands but I can't seem to focus on anything…it's like I'm trapped in a fog...a haze that keeps everything at arms length…<br><br>""It's too late for her now…"" One of the other voices says as it sounds like they are moving in closer. ""We've waited too long…she is tainted far past our abilities even if we act now…"" It continues on. ""If we act now...at least we have the chance of saving her life."" The voice tries again, it's almost a plea.<br><br>Slowly I feel someone grab my arm; it feels rough against my skin like sandpaper but yet gentle…it feels like a warm caress despite its roughness…<br><br>""NO! We cannot let this be the end of her! We have no right to take away her life!"" The man shouts at them as he holds me closer to him.<br><br>Suddenly I feel something strange…something as if something is tugging at my soul…it feels like my soul is being pulled out of my body…like it's being ripped out of its rightful place... And yet I can't seem to move away or push it away...<br><br>""No!"" The man shouts again as he holds onto me even tighter. ""I won't let you take her..."" He tells them as his eyes start to glow with an intense green light.<br><br>I feel a pulling sensation in my heart; it feels like someone has reached inside and wrapped a hand around it and is slowly starting to pull it out of its place... It's a pulling sensation that slowly becomes more painful until I can almost feel the pain becoming unbearable...I look down at the arm the man who looks so familiar is holding; there seems to be some sort of tattoo on the back of his hand…a symbol that looks sort of like a firefly with a sun over top... The pain suddenly grows worse; it's almost unbearable now and I let out what sounds like an earsplitting scream.<br><br>""Give her up now or get away from her!"" The deep voice shouts at him as the pain suddenly stops…<br><br>I slowly open my eyes to see that I am no longer in the room and instead standing outside with a man looking down at me, tears falling from his eyes.<br><br>""Please don't leave me…"" He says as he gently brushes my hair out of my face before kissing me on the forehead. ""I don't want to live without you..."" He tells me with tears falling from his face like a rainstorm. ""Please...I love you so much..."" He says as he holds me close to him.<br><br>Suddenly I feel something tightly gripping my heart; it's like someone has wrapped their hand around it and is slowly taking it out of its rightful place… It feels like they are tearing through everything I am, leaving only a numbness that starts to spread outwardly through every part of my body.<br><br>""No!"" I shout at him as tears fall down my own face. ""Don't let them take your heart! Don't let them take me away from you!"" I shout out at him desperately trying to keep this man who seems so familiar close to me…I feel like he is the last thing keeping me connected to everyone else…he is all I have…<br><br>""I won't lose you like I lost my father."" He tells me as he starts to pull me away from him…I struggle against him. ""It's no use. You're dead weight now."" He tells me as he lets go of my hand...<br><br>""No! Don't leave me!"" I shout at him desperately as he lets go of my hand. ""Don't let them take me away..."" I beg him as tears fall down my face.<br><br>""She is gone now; her soul left this body long before this moment…"" One of the men who looks like a doctor says to the man.<br><br>""NO! PLEASE! YOU CAN'T TAKE HER AWAY FROM ME!"" He screams out desperate for some miracle to happen, but there is no miracle for us…no miracle for anyone except the ones who are already gone...<br><br>As I collapse backwards onto the ground from exhaustion, I look up at the man who looks just like my father…he turns his head away from me and looks into a firefly shaped clay lamp but instead of a firefly inside there are beautiful gold and green flames growing larger with every passing second…then suddenly there is a flash of light",0
Anna Cooper must find a way to stop the darkness from taking over the school and protect the innocent students.,"she was finally going to get her daughter back.<br><br>""You're still not leaving though, are you?"" asked Mike; he shook his head and gestured the door again. ""Fine. You want to stay? Fine. I can't stop you from staying."" He turned his face away from Anna and started muttering to himself again, while Anna started pulling herself up off of the floor. ""Just don't get in my way,"" he said darkly, as Anna got back onto her feet. ""I'm not going to be happy about having you here.""<br><br>""I don't care about your happiness,"" she whispered under her breath as she made her way toward the door. No matter what this guy did or said, Anna couldn't believe that Scott was dead...it just seemed impossible that he wouldn't be there waiting for her to come home any second now with Sophie in tow, ready to tickle his toes and make him laugh while they did homework together. She couldn't believe a word of what Mike was saying...and the more she thought about it, the more she wondered how in the hell somebody could be such a liar for so many years without getting himself caught somehow in all that time.<br><br>""Sophie,"" said Anna, when she finally made it out of the room, as she turned and locked eyes with Mike. ""We're going to get Sophie now.""<br><br>""Yeah,"" scoffed Mike. ""I'll bet you will."" He waved his hand at Anna and rolled his eyes. ""Just go over there to that front door and turn left, the door on the right is opened by a keypad I keep behind the front desk in my office. You can't miss it...there's a big sign on the wall right next to it too.""<br><br>""Oh yeah?"" asked Anna, rolling her eyes at him in return as she glared at him once more. ""Well I'm sure I'll be able to get myself out of here without you holding my hand..."" She took a deep breath and started walking down the hall toward the front desk that he had pointed out, wondering if this was really how things were going to be from now on...she couldn't imagine ever getting used to having Mike around enough to want him anywhere near her or her daughter; this was going to be torture for everyone involved...the only question was whether or not Sophie would take any of what was happening seriously, or if she'd just end up laughing about it like she always did about everything.<br><br>* * * * *<br><br>""Here's your key,"" said Mike as he handed a card over to Anna. ""I've got a code for you that will get you in the first door, and then you can just walk right into the office where I keep my stuff. The door on the right is the one with your daughter in there."" Looking up at her, he paused and took a deep breath before saying, ""That's it. You're here...this is your run of the place now.""<br><br>""Yeah?"" asked Anna; she gave him an evil stare and shook her head at him as she unlocked the office door on the right of the main desk. ""Well I don't need to tell you that this isn't going to be exactly what I'm used to...I'm not sure if you have any idea how much Sophie means to me."" She rolled her eyes at him, unlocked the door and stepped inside. ""I'll do whatever I have to do, but if anything happens to her..."" She left her words hanging in midair as she disappeared into the office and shut out Mike for good; all she wanted now was for Sophie to be safe and sound with no more digs about being crazy or anything like that.<br><br>""Sophie?"" she called out, as she looked around the room, hoping that her daughter wasn't still sleeping or hiding from her, but it was impossible to see much of anything with all of the boxes piled everywhere. Moving forward to search the room a little more thoroughly, Anna found that Sophie's bag was nowhere to be seen; she wasn't sure if that was a good sign or not...she had never been one to hold onto things even after she'd abandoned them...and if she had taken off with Mike it could be anywhere by now.<br><br>""Don't worry,"" said Mike as he stepped into the office behind Anna; he gave a wave of his hand as if brushing away her worries and added, ""All of that is gone now. I got it all in storage...just in case.""<br><br>""In case of what?"" asked Anna. ""Why would you do that? And where did you put my daughter?"" She paused for a moment and then pressed on, thinking about the thought that had popped into her mind and seeming to realize something for the first time. ""You know...I'm not sure about this whole thing..."" She pressed herself against one wall and stared at him as she added, ""I think I want to get out of here...I'm not sure if this is the right place for me or Sophie. There's something very wrong with this place...I can feel it.""<br><br>""Don't worry,"" said Mike, ""it's gonna be fine. Just tell me what you need and I'll make sure it gets taken care of. You're just supposed to be cleaning up the place and that's pretty much it, right?"" He paused for a moment before adding, almost as an afterthought, ""Besides that I guess you can stay in the office in case anyone else needs to be let in or something...""<br><br>""What do you mean by that?"" asked Anna; she narrowed her eyes at him and took a deep breath before adding, ""It doesn't look like anyone else is coming here...at least not for a long time."" Shaking her head at him slightly, she added, ""But if I have to stay up here all night I guess I can handle it..."" She paused for a moment and then gestured toward him with open hands as she added, ""But I'm telling you now...I don't want you near me or my daughter while I'm here."" She leaned forward slightly and glared at him before saying quietly but firmly,",1
The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,"as you come down the stairs. You feel like you've been here before, but you know it's not true; this place is not your home.<br><br>You turn the corner and walk a short way down the hallway and then turn around to look at the room in front of you: You see a long corridor extending all the way to a wide open space at the end; there are windows on both sides where light is coming in from outside. At first glance, nothing seems amiss…but something about this picture is unsettling and unnerving. The house seems familiar somehow… but you can't shake off that feeling that everything isn't right... Someone has been here before...<br><br>You run your finger along the old wallpaper that covers the wall to your left, looking around at everything from one place to another before you continue walking. Everything looks normal enough but there is something strange about this place, something out of place…maybe it was only my imagination after all? You think to yourself as you continue walking down the hallways, looking around at everything along the way… until you come upon an old wooden door with a rusty lever handle; this door is different than all of the others around it and somehow stands out among all of them! This door is very old and decrepit along with the wall that it's attached to...<br><br>You try pushing on the lever to open the door but it's stuck! Why is this door locked? You ask yourself. It shouldn't be locked at all since no one has been here for years now… you give it another good tug but this time with more force, you can hear the wood creaking from around the handle and then there is a loud clatter as a huge chunk of wood breaks off from inside of the handle, falling to the floor.<br><br>You curse under your breath at yourself for being so careless… what if someone heard me? You think to yourself, hoping that no one heard you and that everything will be fine… But everyone seems to be out in town today so you should have some time before anyone comes by, hopefully!<br><br>I must have done that when I was trying to open it earlier…you think as you look back at the door; there are now two holes at both sides of where the knob used to be. ""Well…what else could I do…"" You say out loud as you push on the door with all your might, feeling a great strain on your muscles as they move against you. It's as if the door itself were trying to stop you from coming any further. No matter how hard you push, it refuses to budge…<br><br>You look down at your hands, they are shaking uncontrollably as everything around you starts spinning and your head starts pounding with pain…something is wrong here… the air is thick and oppressive…and your heart is racing faster than ever before. You drop to your knees, struggling to catch your breath as everything around you seems to soften and fade away into oblivion.<br><br>Where am I? You ask yourself as the world around you becomes a blur and you feel yourself losing consciousness... And then everything goes black…<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>""Julia? Julia! Can you hear me?"" The voice of a man wakes me from my troubled sleep. I feel my body moving but I don't have control over it; someone else is moving it for me. My hands seem numb and heavy as if I have been sleeping for more than one night without going to sleep for a long time. I feel so tired....as if all of my life's energy had been drained out of me completely. My head feels clouded and full of thoughts that seem so distant now; they are just out of reach...<br><br>I feel my head being lifted up into the air and I can see that I am being carried by a man in a white lab coat with a mask over his mouth as he carries me out of the dark, claustrophobic place where I was trapped all this time. I try to speak but nothing comes out of my mouth; my throat feels like it is closing up on itself and there is this strange feeling inside of me…like something is trying to erupt from its depths!<br><br>""I need more time..."" The voice of the man says as he continues to carry me through many wooden doors. ""You were supposed to get her when she was ten years old, Doctor!"" A voice tells him, this time coming from somewhere behind me. ""She could have been useful for much longer than now…"" Another voice enters the fray, this time from somewhere in front of us.<br><br>""I know..."" The doctor says with a sigh before placing me back down onto what seems to be a bench as he pulls off his mask and looks back at me with worried eyes. ""Julia… Can you hear me?"" He asks again; his face seems so familiar somehow but I can't quite place him... ""Wake up…please…"" He says as he pushes on my shoulders a little to force me to sit up but I can't seem to move at all.<br><br>""She needs more time..."" The man in the lab coat says; his voice sounds so distant now, as if something is blocking it out. I look around me and try to focus but everything seems blurry and out of reach… ""We cannot wait any longer! We have no need for a girl that is too far consumed by the taint of the spirit world... She will only serve to hurt us all..."" Another voice says from somewhere nearby.<br><br>I look at the man in front of me; his face looks so familiar... I feel like I should know his name or be able to remember where I have seen him before…but yet nothing comes to mind...who is this man?<br><br>""Please..."" He says again with a sigh as he places his hand on top of mine.<br><br>I look down at my hands; they are long and slender, with long fingers that reach up towards my elbows before disappearing underneath my sleeves…I can feel them moving; it's as if they belong to someone else…someone who isn't me but yet they feel so familiar…so much like myself….<br><br>  as you come down the stairs.

I try to speak but nothing comes out of my mouth; my throat feels like it is closing up on itself and there is this strange feeling inside of me…like something is trying to erupt from its depths!<br><br>""I need more time..."" The voice of the man says as he continues to carry me through many wooden doors. ""You were supposed to get her when she was ten years old, Doctor!"" A voice tells him, this time coming from somewhere behind me. ""She could have been useful for much longer than now…"" Another voice enters the fray, this time from somewhere in front of us.<br><br>""I know..."" The doctor says with a sigh before placing me back down onto what seems to be a bench as he pulls off his mask and looks back at me with worried eyes. ""Julia… Can you hear me?"" He asks again; his face seems so familiar somehow but I can't quite place him... ""Wake up…please…"" He says as he pushes on my shoulders a little to force me to sit up but I can't seem to move at all.<br><br>""She needs more time..."" The man in the lab coat says; his voice sounds so distant now, as if something is blocking it out. I look around me and try to focus but everything seems blurry and out of reach… ""We cannot wait any longer! We have no need for a girl that is too far consumed by the taint of the spirit world... She will only serve to hurt us all..."" Another voice says from somewhere nearby.<br><br>I look at the man in front of me; his face looks so familiar... I feel like I should know his name or be able to remember where I have seen him before…but yet nothing comes to mind...who is this man?<br><br>""Please..."" He says again with a sigh as he places his hand on top of mine.<br><br>I look down at my hands; they are long and slender, with long fingers that reach up towards my elbows before disappearing underneath my sleeves…I can feel them moving; it's as if they belong to someone else…someone who isn't me but yet they feel so familiar…so much like myself….<br><br>  as you come down the stairs. You feel like you've been here before, but you know it's not true; this place is not your home.<br><br>You turn the corner and walk a short way down the hallway and then turn around to look at the room in front of you: You see a long corridor extending all the way to a wide open space at the end; there are windows on both sides where light is coming in from outside. At first glance, nothing seems amiss…but something about this picture is unsettling and unnerving. The house seems familiar somehow… but you can't shake off that feeling that everything isn't right... Someone has been here before...<br><br>You run your finger along the old wallpaper that covers the wall to your left, looking around at everything from one place to another before you continue walking. Everything looks normal enough but there is something strange about this place, something out of place…maybe it was only my imagination after all? You think to yourself as you continue walking down the hallways, looking around at everything along the way… until you come upon an old wooden door with a rusty lever handle; this door is different than all of the others around it and somehow stands out among all of them! This door is very old and decrepit along with the wall that it's attached to...<br><br>You try pushing on the lever to open the door but it's stuck! Why is this door locked? You ask yourself. It shouldn't be locked at all since no one has been here for years now… you give it another good tug but this time with more force, you can hear the wood creaking from around the handle and then there is a loud clatter as a huge chunk of wood breaks off from inside of the handle, falling to the floor.<br><br>You curse under your breath at yourself for being so careless… what if someone heard me? You think to yourself, hoping that no one heard you and that everything will be fine… But everyone seems to be out in town today so you should have some time before anyone comes by, hopefully!<br><br>I must have done that when I was trying to open it earlier…you think as you look back at the door; there are now two holes at both sides of where the knob used to be. ""Well…what else could I do…"" You say out loud as you push on the door with all your might, feeling a great strain on your muscles as they move against you. It's as if the door itself were trying to stop you from coming any further. No matter how hard you push, it refuses to budge…<br><br>You look down at your hands, they are shaking uncontrollably as everything around you starts spinning and your head starts pounding with pain…something is wrong here… the air is thick and oppressive…and your heart is racing faster than ever before. You drop to your knees, struggling to catch your breath as everything around you seems to soften and fade away into oblivion.<br><br>Where am I? You ask yourself as the world around you becomes a blur and you feel yourself losing consciousness... And then everything goes black…<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>""Julia? Julia! Can you hear me?"" The voice of a man wakes me from my troubled sleep. I feel my body moving but I don't have control over it; someone else is moving it for me. My hands seem numb and heavy as if I have been sleeping for more than one night without going to sleep for a long time. I feel so tired....as if all of my life's energy had been drained out of me completely. My head feels clouded and full of thoughts that seem so distant now; they are just out of reach...<br><br>I feel my head being lifted up into the air and I can see that I am being carried by a man in a white lab coat with a mask over his mouth as he carries me out of the dark, claustrophobic place where I was trapped all this time.

"Mary Smith, George Smith, Jessica Doe, and John Doe all give testimony in court and John Doe is ultimately convicted and sent to prison.","Wilkinson. Jessica Doe repeated what her husband had said to her about the mugging that night. The only differences between their accounts was that Jessica said George Smith used a gun while John Doe said he used a knife; and that George Smith punched John in the face while John said he just hit him with his fist. Karen Wilkinson thanked her for her time and left her house.<br><br>Karen Wilkinson next went to the police station to get Louise Spencer’s notes on George Smith’s previous interview. She found that Louise had done extensive research on George Smith and had discovered many of his financial troubles. She also found out that he had moved a lot in his life, having moved at least five times in the past ten years.<br><br>Louise Spencer was waiting for her in the interrogation room. She was a tall, dark-haired woman who was very attractive. She had a stern look but she was very polite and professional when they moved into the room. The only furnishings in the room were two plastic chairs placed in front of a small table.<br><br>“Thank you for coming by, Miss Wilkinson. I had hoped to question you earlier, but the interrogation ran longer than expected.”<br><br>“No problem,” said Karen. It was obvious that Louise Spencer was trying hard to make her comfortable during this interrogation.<br><br>“Let us begin then, shall we?” said Louise. “Where were you coming from the night of the mugging?”<br><br>“I was coming from my job at the grocery store. They close the doors at 9 o’clock and I usually try to leave a little early so that I can get there before they lock up the doors. On this particular night, it was hard to leave on time because Mr. Smith and I were having an argument when we got home about his moving to another state. We have been trying to move to another state for the last couple of years but always end up staying here for some reason or another.”<br><br>“Moving to another state seems like a big step. Why do you want to move?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I have a good job here and I don’t want to move away, but my husband wants to move and so we have discussed it over and over again. But he wouldn’t listen to what I had to say this time either, so I  left the house without telling him and decided to walk home because I needed some air.”<br><br>“What did Mr. Smith say when you told him that you were leaving?” asked Louise.<br><br>“He started shouting that I was being disrespectful and then he called me a damn fool!”<br><br>“And what did you do when he said that?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I shouted back at him, but before I knew it he had his gun pointed at me and was demanding my money.”<br><br>Louise looked at George for a long time before she continued.<br><br>“I have a lot of questions about this, Mr. Smith, but before we carry on I need to know whether or not you think Mr. Doe will be convicted for this crime?”<br><br>“I don’t think so, no! He has done this sort of thing before and they let him go,” said George.<br><br>“Why do you think that he will be convicted this time?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I mean, it isn’t like I would really know anything about these things, is it? Do you think he’ll be convicted?” said George.<br><br>Louise was silent for a few seconds.<br><br>“From what I can gather, Mr. Doe has been in trouble before and is often brought in for questioning, but he has never been convicted of anything before now. From what I can tell he’s a drug addict and is involved with some kind of gang or something, and that is what the police have been focusing on so far. We have evidence to suggest that he has an arrest record for stealing money from other people. I don’t know if you have read the news lately, but this has been going on for quite a while and we have proof that this is not the first time that he has stolen from someone,” said Louise.<br><br>George was silent for a while before speaking again.<br><br>“This is ridiculous! He isn’t going to be convicted for taking some money from a woman who was walking down the street! This is a joke, right?” said George.<br><br>Louise paused again before responding.<br><br>“I mean, it isn’t a joke, I will be prosecuting him in court on Monday. There is evidence that he committed the  crime and we have you as a witness who saw it happen, so I don’t see how we can lose. We just need to make sure that John Doe has no opportunity to sway the jury to think otherwise,” said Louise.<br><br>“Seriously though, he wasn’t even trying to kill her or anything. If he had wanted to hurt her, he would have done it much more quickly, wouldn’t he? I don’t see how this is going to result in a conviction. What is the worst case scenario for him? I mean, if we were able to come up with some kind of arrangement with the judge or something, couldn’t we make this all go away? I’d be willing to pay a little bit of money to make sure this doesn’t go any further,” said George.<br><br>Louise Spencer paused again before responding. She moved her fingers across the table, drumming them on its surface as she thought about what to say.<br><br>“I appreciate that you are concerned for John Doe’s well-being here, but we can’t let payment dictate who we prosecute and how seriously we do it. This office has a responsibility to the entire community. We aren’t here to serve the interests of private individuals or corporations—we are here to uphold the law and ensure justice for all,” she said.<br><br>“Okay, I understand that this office has an obligation to the community or whatever, but if you think about it, sending him to jail will only make things worse for him. You have to understand—I wasn’t there when they moved him to this office from the precinct, but a lot of his friends were. They said that he was pretty out of it when they put him in this room. They said they had to strap him down in a chair and he was drooling and foaming at the mouth. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that moving him from the cell to this office probably didn’t do him any good. Right? I mean, if you’re going to move him here, at least move him to a room where he can lie down. Or give him something to drink or something. Don’t just leave him here to rot, you know?”<br><br>Louise Spencer considered this statement for a moment before responding, “I don’t know what  happened when they moved him here, but this office can’t be responsible for the care of criminals. He was apprehended and brought here based on the evidence collected by police officers. The law says he should be prosecuted and that is exactly what we are going to do. There is no excuse for what he did, and the court will rule accordingly. And if you really care about this man, you’ll do your best to help him in court.”<br><br>Tony Wagner stared solemnly at his client for a few seconds before speaking. “You know, not once did you mention that John Doe has been charged with a crime. You didn’t even acknowledge that he’s in this room because of what happened on the street. I think you might want to say something about that.”<br><br>Louise raised her eyebrows and walked over to the window separating them from the courtroom. “Forget it. We all know why John Doe is here. He’s being charged with attempted murder, and if they don’t convict him, the court system has gone to hell in a handbasket, that’s all I have to say.”<br><br>They moved back into the office and sat down. Their conversation was interrupted by Judge Spencer, who burst through the door, leaving a trail of papers behind him. He looked like he was ready to tear someone apart at the seams for stepping on his paper trail. “Court is starting in five minutes and everybody  needs to be there!”<br><br>Tony nodded his head, acknowledging the papers and then said, “Louise, you should probably go.”<br><br>She stood up and looked out the window. “I’m not going to that trial. I’m not prosecuting John Doe. I’m not calling any of the witnesses. But this case isn’t just about John Doe. It’s about Mary Smith, too. It’s about all of us, and how we treat each other in this city—and I didn’t see you doing anything to help Mary Smith when she was walking home last night.”<br><br>Tony was surprised. “What—what are you talking about? What are you talking about, Louise? This is a trial, don’t get crazy.”<br><br>She turned back to face him. “I want to tell Mary Smith’s story. I want to get up there and talk about how she lives with her husband in a tiny apartment that’s falling down around them, and she has to walk home at night by herself because they can’t afford a taxi or a car or even a good pair of shoes—is that crazy enough for you?”<br><br>Tony didn’t know what to say. He said, “I don’t think so. It sounds like you are going off on a tangent here, and I don’t think this is the right way to go about this.”<br><br>Louise was quiet for a moment, then said, “I’ve talked to Jessica Doe. She needs to be heard in all this too. You know she can’t speak English. She barely speaks at all, in fact—and now she’s in the jury room waiting for this verdict to come down and it doesn’t even seem to have occurred to any of you that she might hear what we say here today. Well it occurred to Jessica, and I thought you should know that. She heard everything you said yesterday. She heard everything Mary Smith said today . And she’s expecting us to give it her straight—not like a bunch of lawyers in a bar playing parlor games.”<br><br>Tony said nothing but stood there looking at Louise, his mouth hanging open. “Are you saying that you think she can understand English?”<br><br>Louise shook her head. “No. I’m saying that she is listening to everything very carefully and she has a right to an accounting of everything we do here today. She is your client’s wife, Tony, and this isn’t just about protecting John Doe from her influence, trust me. John Doe is not the only one in this room who needs protection from the people he loves.”<br><br>Tony Wagner had no response to that and turned toward the jury box. “Your Honor, will you please instruct them to wait outside for a few minutes while I talk to counsel?” John Doe looked confused by this request.<br><br>Louise shook Tony Wagner’s arm and tried to drag him the last few steps back to her bench, but he resisted her efforts and turned on his heels toward the jury box instead.<br><br>John Doe was confused by this request.  “Your Honor, may I ask the witness some questions?”<br><br>Tony Wagner ignored John Doe and continued to stare at Louise as his mouth twisted into a sneer. “Louise, as one of the brightest young lawyers I know, you know full well that Mr. Doe is not allowed to cross-examine Mrs. Smith. Our rules are perfectly clear on this point: neither the defendant nor anyone in his family is allowed to question any of the witnesses against him.” He paused and looked pointedly at John Doe for a moment before adding, “That would include a spouse.”<br><br>Louise did not respond, but her eyes narrowed behind the lenses of her glasses as she tried to keep herself under control.<br><br>The judge looked over his glasses in irritation. “Defense counsel, let’s make this simple: you know the rules just as well as I do; there will be no more interruptions.”<br><br>Tony Wagner nodded his agreement and turned back to face the jury with a look of contempt on his face. “George Smith, do you remember your testimony from yesterday?”<br><br>“Yes, I remember it very well.” George Smith shifted nervously in his seat, but spoke in a clear voice.<br><br>George Smith testified that he saw the entire incident and that he was certain that the person who had tried to mug his wife was John Doe. He testified that he had seen it all clearly due to the fact that it had happened right in front of his face .<br><br>The prosecutor rested his case, and John Doe’s lawyer made a last-minute effort to convince the judge that there was one more witness they wanted to call. It was only after a moment’s hesitation that the judge reluctantly agreed.<br><br>George Smith sat down as a young man entered the courtroom and walked up to the witness stand. He was someone Tony Wagner had mentioned in his opening statement, but Mary and Jessica had never seen him before.<br><br>The young man cleared his throat and took off his glasses as he began to speak. “My name is Jeffrey Black, and I used to be the prison guard who was assigned to supervise John Doe before he was moved from our cellblock to solitary confinement.”<br><br>“What did you do with John Doe?” The judge asked.<br><br>“At first, we moved him to a holding cell near the entrance of the prison so that his case could be investigated. After that, he was transferred to a cellblock in solitary confinement and kept there until we received orders to transfer him elsewhere, which we did a few months back.”<br><br>“Did you ever speak with John Doe?” Tony Wagner asked.<br><br>“Yes, I did. He was a model prisoner, always following the rules and maintaining a positive attitude.",1
"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.","and we might be able to meet up more frequently. Do you want to go to NYC?”<br><br>Jenna shook her head in response as she replied, “If I go to Italy, I’ll have to talk with Antonia and Damian at some point. Why can’t I just go there and talk with them now?”<br><br>Liam shrugged his shoulders as he said, “I don’t know. She did say that you shouldn’t come back to the US for a while. This might have something to do with it. But if we don’t go, you won’t be able to help me in any way, because I can’t tell Antonia and Damian about being bitten by Dracula. Who knows what they are capable of doing?”<br><br>Jenna understood the danger that could be in store for Liam if he told anyone about his bite. She also knew that he was right – she wouldn’t be able to help him if she didn’t go to Italy. Getting back to her attacker was her only priority at this moment, and she had to do whatever it took. “Ok, I’ll go to NYC with you, but first we will have to talk with Randolph Howe. Once we are done, I’ll head off to Italy.”<br><br>Liam nodded in agreement as he said, “Deal!” Jenna was feeling happy that they were going to see Randolph Howe again; she liked him, and she trusted his knowledge of vampires.<br><br>They found the vampire community easily. It was still quite early when they arrived, so only a handful of people were walking about. Everybody seemed to be going about their business quietly and respectfully, which made for a very peaceful first impression. As they walked towards the community, Jenna felt a bit uneasy. It seemed like everyone had heard of her – there were many people looking at them as if they were some kind of celebrities.<br><br>It also seemed like everyone knew that she was missing, and had returned; most vampires around here looked surprised to see her. Some didn ’t seem as surprised, and Jenna recognized the looks on their faces. They were the faces of people who knew that she had been hurt, because they had been there when it happened.<br><br>Randolph was already sitting at his desk when they arrived at the community building, but he did stand up and greet Jenna. “Jenna, good to see you again!” He then reached out his hand to Liam. “And you must be Liam Cross?”<br><br>“Yes, sir, I am. I think we have met before?” Jenna noticed that Gregory Maldonado was sitting in the corner of the office, listening in.<br><br>“I don’t think so. But I do recognize you from pictures and stuff. You are Gregory Maldonado’s son, right?”<br><br>Gregory nodded quietly. “That is correct.”<br><br>Liam smiled at Gregory. It was a stiff smile, but he was trying to be polite. “Nice to meet you, sir.”<br><br>Gregory nodded back to him. “Likewise, Mr. Cross. Now, let us move into a private room; we can talk there.” Gregory Maldonado then stood up and gestured for them to follow him.<br><br>They moved into the next room, which was a rather large office with a large desk.<br><br>Gregory sat down behind the desk, and then gestured for them to sit across from him. “Now, let us move on to the reason why you are here. Jenna, I have heard through channels that you are trying to track down Gregory Maldonado’s son?”<br><br>“Yes sir, I am. He is guilty of several crimes that he has committed in Seattle and now in my  town. I want to know where he is so I can bring him to justice.”<br><br>Gregory Maldonado laughed quietly at her words. “Really? Do you truly think he will be brought to justice if you do find him?”<br><br>Liam was starting to get nervous at this conversation. It sounded like something was being set up here, but he didn’t know what it was.<br><br>Jenna gave Gregory an annoyed look. “I do, actually. I just need to find him first so that I can give the evidence I have to the FBI.”<br><br>“You are working for them now, and yet you want to turn your back on them? There is no need to do that. I have people that can help you track down his son, and then they will turn their attention to Antonia Rossi. She has a few people keeping an eye on the club tonight, but I am sure we can move it somewhere else for a night or two. But if we do that, then it would be better if we did it now, as opposed to later. If we wait too long, we will have a lot more eyes on us.<br><br>Liam was starting to get really nervous at this point. He moved a little closer to Jenna just in case he needed to shield her or something.<br><br>Jenna took a couple of seconds to think about this before speaking again. “Moving the club is okay with me, but moving it tonight might be a bad idea.”<br><br>“Moving it to somewhere safe is not a problem. Moving it to somewhere that our enemies can attack without fear of getting hurt would probably be a poor decision. Moving the club now might be an even worse idea though.”<br><br>This was starting to sound like moving the club was a bad idea no matter what.<br><br>Jenna looked over at Antonia. “Moving the club tonight is completely out of the question. We have a huge event tonight at Club Red, and everyone is looking forward to it. Why not move it to another club tomorrow?”<br><br>“Tomorrow night might be a better choice, anyway. If you move the club now, no one would know what or where the change was, and that could make matters even worse for you. You would then have to deal with the people who knew you might move the  club, as well as those who guessed right and chose to follow you there.”<br><br>Jenna looked at Antonia for a little while. This made sense, so she said, “I guess I could postpone the move until tomorrow. Yes, I will be sure that everyone knows what’s happening by the end of tonight.”<br><br>Antonia Rossi nodded a few times, and then said, “I would be happy to help with whatever you need when it comes to your attacker. I do not have much experience with that sort of thing, but I know others who may be able to help  me.”<br><br>Jenna sighed and said, “Okay. I appreciate that. But I have a feeling that the person who did this is going to be killed tonight, if they aren’t already.”<br><br>Antonia Rossi looked at Jenna for a long time and said, “What makes you think that? It seems that only Damian was seen leaving your alley, and he was arrested shortly thereafter.”<br><br>“I saw him leave my alleyway, but not after he assaulted me. He had a knife in his hand. I even got a good look at it, and I know that there’s no way that he could have killed me if he was holding it. He may have moved to the alleyway after he stabbed me, but did so much later. I’m not sure of the exact time frame, but it was definitely after the attack. And if he moved to my alleyway after the attack, then maybe he ran into Damian Henchman there, which is why he was arrested.”<br><br>Damian Henchman said, “Jenna, that is a possibility. Damian has already been questioned by the police about what happened to you. It is possible that they talked about moving to your alleyway. But why would you think that only one person was responsible for your attack?”<br><br>“Because I didn’t see anyone else that night. I didn’t hear anyone else, either. And I definitely didn’t feel anyone moving around me in the dark.”<br><br>Antonia piped up, “Jenna is right. She was moving around a lot with her superhuman speed and agility, and she would have noticed if someone was anywhere near her.”<br><br>“Well, I can tell you that someone was moving around, because I did feel something,” said Jenna. “But it was only one thing moving around me. For the most part, that thing just held still and waited for the right time to pounce. So I moved around a little bit myself to figure out what was going on, but then it moved in the same minute that I did. And then it just held still while I tried to fight back, and then it jumped on me, picked me up, and carried me away from wherever I was walking. Then it carried me over to the alleyway between your club and my apartment building. And then it  stabbed me, and I don’t really remember anything after that.”<br><br>Dread filled Jenna’s heart as she thought about everything she had been through. This was certainly the worst thing that had ever happened to her in her entire life, and yet it wasn’t even close to the worst attack that had been made against her.<br><br>All around them, everyone watched and listened intently.<br><br>“This is a very serious accusation you are making, Miss Riley,” said Judge White. “There is no proof that Damian Henchman is your attacker at all. You were found covered with blood in a back alley, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he attacked you there. In fact, it doesn’t even necessarily mean that he attacked you at all. The evidence will be presented tomorrow morning. Until then, Mr. Henchman will remain in custody here at the courthouse.”<br><br>Jenna nodded, and they exited the courtroom together. They moved to a separate room in the basement of the courthouse, a holding cell where they could speak privately and still be guarded by both security personnel and police officers. Judge White ordered security to escort both Jenna and Henchman into this room. They moved to the room, accompanied by four security guards and a detective who had worked on the case.<br><br>The courtroom was large and imposing. The holding cell was small and cramped. Jasper moved to one corner of it, opposite the door, while Damian moved to another corner opposite him. Jenna took up a position in the middle of the room, facing both men.<br><br>Jenna was standing very still, staring intently at Damian Henchman. It was clear that she had moved past being just angry to being downright furious with him now. She had stopped herself from attacking him, but only barely—she could feel that she was holding herself back by a thread of willpower alone.<br><br>Damian moved to the center of the room as well, facing Jenna. His face was clean-shaven now, and he did not look like himself at all. He looked smaller, more vulnerable than before. He moved to the center of the room, moving past a metal divider that separated Jenna from him.<br><br>Jenna moved to one side of the divider, away from Damian Henchman.<br><br>Damian looked at Jasper, then to one of the security officers in the room, gesturing with his head for them to leave. The security officer nodded and moved to the door, opening it and gesturing for the other three men to leave as well.<br><br>The detective lingered for a moment, looking first at Jenna, then at Damian. He hesitated, then moved to leave as well.<br><br>Jenna watched the men leave, then turned her attention back to Damian.<br><br>""You attacked me,"" she said, her voice low and dangerous. It was not a question.<br><br>Damian swallowed, but did not say anything. He looked away from Jenna's gaze.<br><br>""Why?"" Jenna asked. ""What did I ever do to you?""<br><br>Damian shook his head. ""You didn't do anything,"" he said. ""It wasn't personal.""<br><br>""Not personal?"" Jenna repeated, her voice incredulous. ""You nearly killed me, and you say it wasn't personal?""",1
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.","stunned at everything that he had just told me.

I would have to tag along behind him and help him solve the cases – or he wouldn't hire me!<br><br>""So our first case together will be…?"" I said when there was a lull in our conversation. It was already very clear to me that there wasn't much for me to do – but I still felt like I needed an assignment of some kind!<br><br>""The dog park murders,"" Mr Smith replied with a slight smile on his face.

If we can do this, then they will pay us handsomely and we can use some of those funds to build a secret base…""<br><br>""What is their secret?"" I interrupted, growing more excited as this conversation went on. It sounded like it might be interesting after all!<br><br>""The location of their entire clan,"" Mr Smith replied with a knowing smile on his face. ""That is how they are able to travel in secret and pass unnoticed in their human form. The biggest problem with that, however, is that if they reveal that location to their enemies, then they will be attacked and destroyed. So they keep it secret and let everyone think that they are nothing more than a myth…but we can prove them wrong, my dear Kitty.""<br><br>""Alright,"" I replied with a slight nod of my head. ""So what would your plan be?""<br><br>""We have to work fast and solve the case before the police,"" he replied as he looked out of the window once again. ""My sources told me that if we don't solve it quickly enough, then a man named Fluffy Barkin might take over the case for himself.""<br><br>""Is he really named Fluffy Barkin?"" I asked – feeling completely skeptical about this news. Was this some kind of a joke?<br><br>""No,"" Mr Smith said with a shake of his head. ""He's just called 'Fluffy' instead – because he is so hairy around his neck! He's very strong and good at catching criminals – but has no real clue about how to solve crimes. He'll need our help on this one!""<br><br>I let out a small laugh at this, but Mr Smith didn't share my amusement. It was clear that he was serious about this case, which I didn't know how to take. I couldn't believe that a man had named himself after his fur – and I thought that it would be the start of a very strange adventure indeed!<br><br>Chapter 3<br><br>For the rest of the day, we drove around in Mr Smith's car and asked innocent passersby if they had seen anything strange happening at the dog park recently. At first, it seemed like everyone had seen something – but all their answers were so different that it was hard to tell what was going on at all!<br><br>""So, they all said something different?"" Mr Smith asked me, raising an eyebrow at me in disbelief. ""What kind of story did they tell you?""<br><br>""Well…they all said that there were dogs running wild and attacking each other,"" I replied, feeling completely baffled by everything that he was saying. It seemed like Mr Smith had no clue about who to trust…which wasn't such a bad thing for me! ""They kept saying that some of the animals were missing…and then when I asked them why these things kept happening…they just said…""<br><br>""They just said that it was because of the 'wolf who comes to this place',"" Mr Smith finished for me. ""And that's it?""<br><br>""No,"" I said with a shake of my head. ""They also said that this wolf is really cute… but if you try to pet him all of these spikes will come out of his back and he'll try to kill you!""<br><br>""What?"" Mr Smith asked, growing more and more confused as we continued to talk. ""You think they meant something else…don't you?""<br><br>""Well, think about it,"" I replied with a smile on my face. These people weren't just talking about a real wolf – they must have been talking about our next case! It seemed like no one could figure out what was going on at the dog park – which meant that we had a great chance at figuring out what was going on. The only thing was, how were we going to do that?<br><br>We drove in silence for the next few minutes as we tried to figure out what our plan would be, but I soon realized that there wasn't one at all! This case seemed impossible – how could we simply solve it? We had no suspects at all! We couldn't even figure out what was going on at all!<br><br>""Maybe we shouldn't have come here,"" Mr Smith finally said with a sigh. ""If nothing is going on here then we should have probably stayed home – who knows what else could have happened? Maybe we've taken too long to figure this case out and it's too late now?""<br><br>I nodded my head silently in agreement, but I also said, ""Mr Smith, no one knows where the wolf is or how he's killing these dogs…but me and you are the only ones who can look into the case!""<br><br>""I'm not really sure if there is a case to look at,"" Mr Smith replied with a frown. ""But you're right – we are the only ones who know about this situation and there must be someone behind this – even if it isn't Fluffy Barkin.""<br><br>'What about Sergei Snipe?' I wondered. Was he behind all of this somehow? Was he trying to start some kind of war between dogs and cats? Well, maybe it didn't matter one way or another – all that mattered was that we do our best in order to solve this mystery!<br><br>Chapter 4<br><br>As soon",0
"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.","and we might be able to meet up more frequently. Do you want to go to NYC?”<br><br>Jenna shook her head in response as she replied, “If I go to Italy, I’ll have to talk with Antonia and Damian at some point. Why can’t I just go there and talk with them now?”<br><br>Liam shrugged his shoulders as he said, “I don’t know. She did say that you shouldn’t come back to the US for a while. This might have something to do with it. But if we don’t go, you won’t be able to help me in any way, because I can’t tell Antonia and Damian about being bitten by Dracula. Who knows what they are capable of doing?”<br><br>Jenna understood the danger that could be in store for Liam if he told anyone about his bite. She also knew that he was right – she wouldn’t be able to help him if she didn’t go to Italy. Getting back to her attacker was her only priority at this moment, and she had to do whatever it took. “Ok, I’ll go to NYC with you, but first we will have to talk with Randolph Howe. Once we are done, I’ll head off to Italy.”<br><br>Liam nodded in agreement as he said, “Deal!” Jenna was feeling happy that they were going to see Randolph Howe again; she liked him, and she trusted his knowledge of vampires.<br><br>They found the vampire community easily. It was still quite early when they arrived, so only a handful of people were walking about. Everybody seemed to be going about their business quietly and respectfully, which made for a very peaceful first impression. As they walked towards the community, Jenna felt a bit uneasy. It seemed like everyone had heard of her – there were many people looking at them as if they were some kind of celebrities.<br><br>It also seemed like everyone knew that she was missing, and had returned; most vampires around here looked surprised to see her. Some didn ’t seem as surprised, and Jenna recognized the looks on their faces. They were the faces of people who knew that she had been hurt, because they had been there when it happened.<br><br>Randolph was already sitting at his desk when they arrived at the community building, but he did stand up and greet Jenna. “Jenna, good to see you again!” He then reached out his hand to Liam. “And you must be Liam Cross?”<br><br>“Yes, sir, I am. I think we have met before?” Jenna noticed that Gregory Maldonado was sitting in the corner of the office, listening in.<br><br>“I don’t think so. But I do recognize you from pictures and stuff. You are Gregory Maldonado’s son, right?”<br><br>Gregory nodded quietly. “That is correct.”<br><br>Liam smiled at Gregory. It was a stiff smile, but he was trying to be polite. “Nice to meet you, sir.”<br><br>Gregory nodded back to him. “Likewise, Mr. Cross. Now, let us move into a private room; we can talk there.” Gregory Maldonado then stood up and gestured for them to follow him.<br><br>They moved into the next room, which was a rather large office with a large desk.<br><br>Gregory sat down behind the desk, and then gestured for them to sit across from him. “Now, let us move on to the reason why you are here. Jenna, I have heard through channels that you are trying to track down Gregory Maldonado’s son?”<br><br>“Yes sir, I am. He is guilty of several crimes that he has committed in Seattle and now in my  town. I want to know where he is so I can bring him to justice.”<br><br>Gregory Maldonado laughed quietly at her words. “Really? Do you truly think he will be brought to justice if you do find him?”<br><br>Liam was starting to get nervous at this conversation. It sounded like something was being set up here, but he didn’t know what it was.<br><br>Jenna gave Gregory an annoyed look. “I do, actually. I just need to find him first so that I can give the evidence I have to the FBI.”<br><br>“You are working for them now, and yet you want to turn your back on them? There is no need to do that. I have people that can help you track down his son, and then they will turn their attention to Antonia Rossi. She has a few people keeping an eye on the club tonight, but I am sure we can move it somewhere else for a night or two. But if we do that, then it would be better if we did it now, as opposed to later. If we wait too long, we will have a lot more eyes on us.<br><br>Liam was starting to get really nervous at this point. He moved a little closer to Jenna just in case he needed to shield her or something.<br><br>Jenna took a couple of seconds to think about this before speaking again. “Moving the club is okay with me, but moving it tonight might be a bad idea.”<br><br>“Moving it to somewhere safe is not a problem. Moving it to somewhere that our enemies can attack without fear of getting hurt would probably be a poor decision. Moving the club now might be an even worse idea though.”<br><br>This was starting to sound like moving the club was a bad idea no matter what.<br><br>Jenna looked over at Antonia. “Moving the club tonight is completely out of the question. We have a huge event tonight at Club Red, and everyone is looking forward to it. Why not move it to another club tomorrow?”<br><br>“Tomorrow night might be a better choice, anyway. If you move the club now, no one would know what or where the change was, and that could make matters even worse for you. You would then have to deal with the people who knew you might move the  club, as well as those who guessed right and chose to follow you there.”<br><br>Jenna looked at Antonia for a little while. This made sense, so she said, “I guess I could postpone the move until tomorrow. Yes, I will be sure that everyone knows what’s happening by the end of tonight.”<br><br>Antonia Rossi nodded a few times, and then said, “I would be happy to help with whatever you need when it comes to your attacker. I do not have much experience with that sort of thing, but I know others who may be able to help  me.”<br><br>Jenna sighed and said, “Okay. I appreciate that. But I have a feeling that the person who did this is going to be killed tonight, if they aren’t already.”<br><br>Antonia Rossi looked at Jenna for a long time and said, “What makes you think that? It seems that only Damian was seen leaving your alley, and he was arrested shortly thereafter.”<br><br>“I saw him leave my alleyway, but not after he assaulted me. He had a knife in his hand. I even got a good look at it, and I know that there’s no way that he could have killed me if he was holding it. He may have moved to the alleyway after he stabbed me, but did so much later. I’m not sure of the exact time frame, but it was definitely after the attack. And if he moved to my alleyway after the attack, then maybe he ran into Damian Henchman there, which is why he was arrested.”<br><br>Damian Henchman said, “Jenna, that is a possibility. Damian has already been questioned by the police about what happened to you. It is possible that they talked about moving to your alleyway. But why would you think that only one person was responsible for your attack?”<br><br>“Because I didn’t see anyone else that night. I didn’t hear anyone else, either. And I definitely didn’t feel anyone moving around me in the dark.”<br><br>Antonia piped up, “Jenna is right. She was moving around a lot with her superhuman speed and agility, and she would have noticed if someone was anywhere near her.”<br><br>“Well, I can tell you that someone was moving around, because I did feel something,” said Jenna. “But it was only one thing moving around me. For the most part, that thing just held still and waited for the right time to pounce. So I moved around a little bit myself to figure out what was going on, but then it moved in the same minute that I did. And then it just held still while I tried to fight back, and then it jumped on me, picked me up, and carried me away from wherever I was walking. Then it carried me over to the alleyway between your club and my apartment building. And then it  stabbed me, and I don’t really remember anything after that.”<br><br>Dread filled Jenna’s heart as she thought about everything she had been through. This was certainly the worst thing that had ever happened to her in her entire life, and yet it wasn’t even close to the worst attack that had been made against her.<br><br>All around them, everyone watched and listened intently.<br><br>“This is a very serious accusation you are making, Miss Riley,” said Judge White. “There is no proof that Damian Henchman is your attacker at all. You were found covered with blood in a back alley, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he attacked you there. In fact, it doesn’t even necessarily mean that he attacked you at all. The evidence will be presented tomorrow morning. Until then, Mr. Henchman will remain in custody here at the courthouse.”<br><br>Jenna nodded, and they exited the courtroom together. They moved to a separate room in the basement of the courthouse, a holding cell where they could speak privately and still be guarded by both security personnel and police officers. Judge White ordered security to escort both Jenna and Henchman into this room. They moved to the room, accompanied by four security guards and a detective who had worked on the case.<br><br>The courtroom was large and imposing. The holding cell was small and cramped. Jasper moved to one corner of it, opposite the door, while Damian moved to another corner opposite him. Jenna took up a position in the middle of the room, facing both men.<br><br>Jenna was standing very still, staring intently at Damian Henchman. It was clear that she had moved past being just angry to being downright furious with him now. She had stopped herself from attacking him, but only barely—she could feel that she was holding herself back by a thread of willpower alone.<br><br>Damian moved to the center of the room as well, facing Jenna. His face was clean-shaven now, and he did not look like himself at all. He looked smaller, more vulnerable than before. He moved to the center of the room, moving past a metal divider that separated Jenna from him.<br><br>Jenna moved to one side of the divider, away from Damian Henchman.<br><br>Damian looked at Jasper, then to one of the security officers in the room, gesturing with his head for them to leave. The security officer nodded and moved to the door, opening it and gesturing for the other three men to leave as well.<br><br>The detective lingered for a moment, looking first at Jenna, then at Damian. He hesitated, then moved to leave as well.<br><br>Jenna watched the men leave, then turned her attention back to Damian.<br><br>""You attacked me,"" she said, her voice low and dangerous. It was not a question.<br><br>Damian swallowed, but did not say anything. He looked away from Jenna's gaze.<br><br>""Why?"" Jenna asked. ""What did I ever do to you?""<br><br>Damian shook his head. ""You didn't do anything,"" he said. ""It wasn't personal.""<br><br>""Not personal?"" Jenna repeated, her voice incredulous. ""You nearly killed me, and you say it wasn't personal?""",1
Sally unexpectedly dies and Paula must deal with the guilt of her secret and the possibility of what could have been.,"about the past couple of months.<br><br>""I'm so glad to have you here with me,"" Paula said with a smile as she looked over at Sally who was resting her head against her arm as she sat in a sideways position so that she could look at Paula while they were talking. ""It's so nice to have someone else here with me.""<br><br>""I'm really happy that I can be here with you too,"" Sally said with a small smile before she looked away and glanced over at the tent behind them. ""It may be kind of weird to say this, but... I had never been camping before until I met you and now I realize how much I love it...""<br><br>Paula nodded slowly before giving Sally a sincere smiled. ""That's great... It's really fun and relaxing.""<br><br>""I know, it is,"" Sally said with a nod, then she smiled once more before asking, ""Do you think we should go to sleep soon?""<br><br>""Probably,"" Paula replied slowly before putting her empty bowl on the ground next to her then laying back onto her sleeping bag and stretching out comfortably, trying not to think about how uncomfortable the hard ground would actually be that night when they were actually in their tent.<br><br>""Do you want to go to sleep first or do you want me to?"" Sally asked with a playful grin as she closed her eyes and rested her head against her arm again, waiting patiently for Paula's response.<br><br>Paula sighed then nodded as she answered, ""You should go to sleep first... I'll probably fall asleep soon after.""<br><br>Sally nodded then reached for a pillow before crawling into their tent and laying down on her sleeping bag on the floor, propping her head up with the pillow so that she could look out of the tent through the small window next to them. She smiled as she thought about how lucky they were at that moment, being able to have this time alone together where they didn't have to worry about anything else. She looked over at Paula who was lying on her back with her eyes closed and playfully nudged Paula's side with one of her feet. ""Come on... Go to sleep already.""<br><br>Paula opened one eye slowly before letting out a small giggle and turning onto her side so that she was facing Sally, bringing a hand up to rest against Sally's face. ""Okay, okay,"" she said in a gentle tone as she moved closer towards Sally. She smiled softly then closed her eyes and nuzzled her face against Sally's neck before kissing it lightly then resting her head against Sally's chest. She felt Sally wrap an arm around her shoulders before she took a deep breath, feeling as if she was safe and secure in this moment.<br><br>Sally smiled softly as she gently ran her fingers through Paula's hair before kissing the top of Paula's head gently. ""Goodnight...""<br><br>The two continued to lay silently for a few minutes, just enjoying the closeness of the other person and hearing their slow, steady breathing. They didn't have to say anything with words because their actions were saying everything that they needed to know; that they loved each other with all of their hearts and couldn't imagine what life would be like without the other person in it. After a few minutes, they both heard the sun starting to go down and knew that they had been laying like that for almost half an hour now. They opened their eyes slowly, looking at each other with a smile before Paula closed her eyes again and moved closer towards Sally so that their lips were centimetres apart from each other as if waiting for one of them to close the gap between them.<br><br>""Goodnight,"" Melissa whispered as she closed the gap between them, kissing Paula softly. She let out a small sigh as she felt Paula's lips against hers, feeling as if she was home in this moment, and suddenly felt tired as her eyes started to droop. ""It's nice here,"" Melissa whispered before pressing her lips against Paula's again, kissing her more passionately.<br><br>Paula smiled softly before wrapping her arms around Sally and moving closer towards her so that they were now chest to chest then parted her lips slightly so that they were now pressed against Sally's lips. She sighed slightly as she felt Sally press herself against Paula, wanting more of their bodies to be touching each other than they were at that moment. Paula moaned lightly then wiggled out of her sleeping bag to lie on the floor with Sally before she pulled the sleeping bag over both of them so that they could stay warm. The two continued to kiss for several more minutes until neither of them could hold their eyes open anymore and slowly fell asleep; where they had always wanted to be... In each others' arms.<br><br>The End!<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>I hope you enjoyed my submission! Looking forward to seeing what everyone else will come up with! :)<br><br>~ Kerrigan~<br><br>Hey everyone! I'm really excited to share this idea with all of you. A while back, I read a book called 'The Summer That Melted Everything' by Tiffany McDaniel. It's a book about a girl named Sally who gets married to her best friend Paula and how the two of them overcome their struggles together throughout their marriage. When I read it, I fell in love with the premise of the story and had so many ideas on where it could go from there, so here's my take on it! :)Paula has a secret. She's been married to her husband for 5 years, and they have a 2-year-old daughter. During that time, she's also been having an affair with her best friend's husband. She knows it's wrong, but she can't help how she feels. When her best friend unexpectedly dies, Paula is left to deal with the guilt of her secret and the possibilities of what could have been.""So... What do you think?""""It looks nice,"" Melissa said with a smile as she watched Sally walk across the room and look at herself in the mirror before giving herself one final once over.""You think so?""""Yeah,"" Melissa said as she raised an eyebrow at Sally.""Okay",1

Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"friends, and she had stopped taking part in the activities she used to enjoy doing in her spare time. Shannon was spending more time alone at home because her father didn’t seem interested in doing anything with her, and so it seemed as though she had no one else to turn to but herself. “She’s trying to cope with her loss, and I don’t think she’s learned to do that yet,” Uncle Jeff said.<br><br>Shannon was sitting on the edge of her bed, holding a box of oil paints that was given to her by her mother before she passed away from cancer. She started crying uncontrollably once again upon seeing both her uncle and father approach her room slowly. “What are you doing here?” Shannon asked, wiping the tears from her face and standing up. There were paint stains on her cheeks, nose and hands. Her uncle could see that she had been crying for a while.<br><br>“I came to talk to you,” her father said.<br><br>“About what?” Shannon asked, turning away from them. She started pacing around the room as she spoke. “You don’t care how I feel, so why should I tell you?” she asked.<br><br>Her father stepped inside the room and placed a hand on her shoulder. “I do care about how you feel daughter,” he said softly. Her uncle noticed that there were small tears forming in her father’s eyes.<br><br>“Yeah, right. If you did care, you wouldn’t have left us all behind to deal with this grief on our own,” she said, turning to face her father directly now. She looked in his eyes and saw that he had started crying now. “He doesn’t care.” She turned to face her uncle now. “You don’t care either, do you?”<br><br>Her uncle sighed and shook his head slowly. He did care, but he knew that she wouldn’t believe him just yet. “No, I do care Shannon,” he said gently.<br><br>She looked at him for a few moments while the tears continued to fall from her father’s eyes and then nodded and walked over to sit on her bed. The two men stood nearby, unsure of what to do next. Her father was crying now,  so he didn’t know how to handle this situation.<br><br>Shannon saw the box of oil paints on her nightstand. She picked it up and opened it slowly, letting the tears continue to stream down her face as she did so. She stared at the empty canvas in front of her for a few moments before she took out a large brush and dipped it into a small jar of red paint. Then, Shannon started to paint.<br><br>She started painting out of her own grief and loneliness, but as she worked, she found that somehow painting helped to ease it. She painted for hours and didn’t eat anything. Shannon’s need to paint became so strong that she decided to clear out her attic and turn it into a studio, so that she could paint there whenever she felt like it.<br><br>She turned her old wooden desk into a workbench and filled the walls with canvases, paints, brushes, and other painting materials. Shannon moved her easel to the center of the room and placed two chairs in front of it. She hung some potted plants in the corners of the room for decoration purposes. The attic was small, but she didn’t mind that. It was just right for her. It also reminded  her of the attic in the family’s old barn.<br><br>Shannon would spend hours in the studio, painting and listening to music on her headphones. She discovered that drawing people helped her to feel connected with her mother once more, and so she would draw portraits of her mother over and over again. The  act of drawing also helped Shannon to cope with her feelings.<br><br>Shannon started to put her own feelings into the paintings, too. She could often be found staring at one of her own unfinished paintings, which had two figures standing in a meadow. The figures were very dark and pale, reflecting Shannon’s feelings of being filled with darkness but also feeling a glimmer of light at the same time.<br><br>This painting became an outlet for Shannon and she would often sit and stare at it for long periods of time to try to work some of her pain and confusion out on it. Sometimes, she would cover the painted surface with salt and trace the outlines of her paintings in a faint blue wash. This felt like she was connecting with someone, especially since her own mother could no longer speak to her. Shannon felt as if she were having a conversation with her mother by painting the images over and over again. Shannon started to feel closer to her paintings and knew that they helped her to heal.<br><br>Shannon painted for hours every day, with only a short break for lunch which she always ate while standing up. She drank a lot of water so that she wouldn’t feel weak or tired. She felt almost as peaceful as when she was painting and felt that it was her therapy. Shannon painted every night until she finished a painting, and then she would start a new one. Sometimes, she would paint for six hours straight without stopping, and this helped to ease the pain in her heart. Sometimes, while painting, Shannon felt like",1

Six months, and still he couldn’t figure out what had killed her. She was healthy before; she was healthy after. And yet...<br><br>He stopped, and started to put down the flowers. Jack had never been much for grieving-never been much one for being here six months later either-but you have to pay respects to the lost. There's just no getting around that. He knelt down nearby, as if he were looking at something on the ground while keeping watch over his wife's resting place at the same time. But this wasn't a prime spot to stop; there wasn't really a tree nearby, and while his back was turned nobody would be able to see him anyway. But there was no reason not to take advantage of it...<br><br>""Hey there,"" Jack said out loud, talking mostly to himself in a soft tone that wasn't meant for anyone else. ""It's me."" After that there was silence again for a second or two before Jack continued talking. ""I'm just here to see you. You know that, right?"" He tried to smile, but it faded quickly. Perhaps the sight of her headstone-or perhaps just the realization of how long it had really been since she'd last been able to talk back-was too much for him. ""Not that you can talk back."" He sat down on the grass, and looked at a mark in it that could have once been a footprint or something like that, but was now just part of nature. ""Maybe it's silly to expect you to hear.""<br><br>The silence continued, and Jack couldn't help but wonder why he'd come up with this idea in the first place. Maybe there would have been some other way if he'd known what was going to happen; maybe there would have been time for him to realize before then and even prepare himself for it. But no matter what he did, he would only be able to go forward; he couldn't do anything about the past. And thus far there was no future either-nothing in sight worth looking forward to anyway.<br><br>""I miss you,"" Jack said softly once more, looking around at all sides as if checking for anybody who might be watching him before whispering a little too softly to be heard, ""I love you.""<br><br>He started to get up, as if he were leaving. But that feeling never really went away-the one where he couldn't walk away from this, not really. He sat back down slowly, and for a long time he was silent once more. And then the words started coming again. ""I know I shouldn't think about it."" He looked away for a moment, looking off into the distance and a little off to the side as if he were talking to someone who wasn't there anymore. ""But I can't help but wonder..."" Jack took a deep breath before speaking again; still very softly but with an edge of defiance that hadn’t been in his voice before and never would be again. ""Why did you have to die?""<br><br>He was ready to leave now; ready to finish this business and stop talking like this. It wasn't supposed to matter what happened now-it wasn’t supposed to mean anything anymore-and yet...<br><br>A tear rolled down his cheek more quickly than he could wipe it away as his voice got softer once more. ""I'm trying,"" Jack said quietly, barely loud enough for anyone beside himself to hear at all, ""I'm trying to let you go.""<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Loyalty, friendship, and most of all love. You'd think that there wouldn't be any more after the last one-that it would be impossible for anything to replace the feeling of being in love. But that wasn't true; it wasn't like a light switch where once you turn it off you can never turn it back on again. It was more like a chandelier-you might take it apart and lay the pieces somewhere safe, but it's always there if you decide to build it back up again someday.<br><br>Most people don't think about things like that when they're young and they're in love; they think they'll just be happily ever after with their partner forever. But somewhere along the way reality starts to intrude on them like a thief in the night, taking away their dreams one by one before eventually stealing away their ability to hope any longer. Jack still believed in hope, and didn’t intend to give up his faith in that yet even though he wasn’t sure exactly what he was hoping for anymore. All he knew was what he couldn't have; what he couldn't have today or tomorrow or next week...but someday he'd have to come to terms with accepting that.<br><br>""You could have at least told me you wanted to be alone."" There was no answer; she wasn't supposed to answer him anymore. ""If you're listening, I'm sorry. I should have known better.""<br><br>A tear rolled down Jack's cheek again as he hesitated, not sure whether he should say what he was thinking or not. It wasn't like there was anybody who would be listening to him even if he did-it really wasn’t like his wife of all people. But at the same time there were some things that Jack simply couldn’t bear keeping inside himself anymore, and this seemed like one of them.<br><br>""I can't wait forever; I know that now,"" Jack said quietly in a voice that almost seemed too soft for anyone else besides himself to hear, ""but I don't know how much longer I can do it without being able to see you again."" He wiped the tear off his cheek before it could run down any further, but it didn’t really matter because another one soon followed in its place as if eager to take its place before this one had even finished its path.

In particular, she meets an old woman whose tapping toe seems to foretell bad things happening. Premise Analysis & Evaluation : I have always been a fan of the horror genre, especially when it comes to slasher films and other films with strange happenings that lead to deaths. The first thing that came to mind when I read this premise was the movie ""Poltergeist"", which also deals with supernatural happenings in an apartment complex. I think that this premise lends itself very well as a horror film because of how strange it is in comparison to normal activities in an apartment complex, let alone everyday life. It would be interesting if the writer delves into why some of these activities happen, which is something I normally enjoy seeing in horror films. Premise Analysis & Evaluation (Cont'd): There isn't much to do here except for creating a good story. I feel that this premise lends itself greatly for a ghost story, because ghost stories often deal with bizarre happenings that don't make sense. A good writer could make the protagonist's new apartment complex a haunted one, and the reader could find themselves being scared as the protagonist is. However, I also like the idea of making this a time travel film because every supernatural story is essentially a time travel story (another example would be ""The Butterfly Effect""). There are two different outcomes here: either make it a ghost story or make it into an actual time travel film.<br><br>Premise Analysis & Evaluation (Cont'd): An issue I had when writing this analysis was how to present the information in comparison to other stories on FictionPress. One way of doing so is to compare/contrast it with movies or other similar ideas around on FictionPress, which is something that's usually done when writing an analysis. The problem with doing so is that there really isn't any other stories similar to ""Tap Toes Doorstep"" out there on FictionPress--at least not ones with similar premises--so it would be difficult to make comparisons. The only way of solving this problem is to not make comparisons, which would be a shame. Therefore, I decided to stop doing analysis in this manner and instead talk about the premise itself and its positives and negatives, which is something that a lot of other writers do (and have done).<br><br>I have always been a fan of the horror genre, especially when it comes to slasher films and other films with strange happenings that lead to deaths.

It's recent enough to still be suspicious and odd looking; however, there isn't much info provided by Natalie or explained by the writer on why this actually happening outside their apartment complex. This is important because it leads the reader to question why this happened so close to home, but we never get an answer to it (though talking with friends we came up with many ideas). Also I didn't like how difficult it would be",0
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"<br><br>""I can't do it,"" said Anna. Her voice was shaky and hollow. ""I'm not going to do this.""<br><br>Mike stood in front of her, his face contorted with anger. ""Anna, you signed a contract. You promised me that you would take this job.""<br><br>The two were in Anna's small apartment behind the school where she worked as a janitor. It had been ten minutes since Mike had stormed into the room. Up until he arrived, Anna had been packing her belongings, getting ready to leave her job as a janitor at an exclusive school in Brooklyn Heights and travel back home to California for good. She hadn't exactly planned on leaving just yet, but when Mike had told her about the new janitor that he'd hired for her position, she'd realized immediately that there was no point in staying any longer. She'd always loved New York City and this particular job, but she knew that it wasn't meant to be hers forever; it was time for something else to happen in her life now. But what? She'd never seen herself as a janitor: that wasn't who she was or who she wanted to be. Unfortunately, though, it seemed like what Mike wanted from her now was just that.<br><br>""You need to calm down,"" she said calmly. She was trying to keep her cool despite how scary Mike could be when he got angry. ""You're not making sense right now.""<br><br>""I'm not making sense? You're the one who's not making sense! You promised me that you'd work at this school as a janitor for as long as I needed you, and now you're saying that you're going to quit? I just don't understand! What is so bad about this school, Anna?! What have I done to make you hate it?""<br><br>""I don't hate it,"" said Anna quickly. ""I can't stand it anymore, okay? It's been six months since I've started working here, and nothing has changed. There's no way that anyone would start something like this just so they can keep it up for years at a time without any intention of ending it sooner.""<br><br>""But of course there are things on the books that have to take time before they can be fulfilled,"" said Mike quickly, his head shaking back and forth in disbelief. ""That's why this is such an opportunity for others like us; after all, we've had the benefit of years of careful planning.""<br><br>""What do you mean?"" asked Anna.<br><br>Mike looked like he was about to drop another bomb on her. ""Anna, look around you! We're standing in an office. This is where I meet with other coworkers every day to discuss our progress and what to do next.""<br><br>Anna looked around the room even as she pulled her eyes away from Mike's face. She wasn't sure if she wanted to see what he was showing her or not, but all of his talk about coworkers had made her curious; after all, she'd found nothing of the sort on this floor when she'd cleaned it before he came in and started talking about making a group of workers at his company or something. ""I don't see any-"" she started to say, but that was all that came out before she caught sight of something on the wall. It wasn't anything big: just a blackboard with some scribbles written on it. But as soon as her eyes landed on it, Anna's jaw dropped open in surprise and shock. What were those words? They didn't seem like they were written by anyone who worked at the school; they seemed...like something else entirely...something much more sinister...<br><br>""It's been part of my plan all along,"" Mike told her. Anna could tell that he was getting agitated, but she didn't care. She was afraid to look at him, afraid of the anger in his eyes; he might have been a good-looking man for his age, but the truth about him was that he had a cold and dark soul. ""I've been planning this for months.""<br><br>""You've been planning it?"" asked Anna, her voice so high in pitch that she almost didn't recognize it. ""What are you going to do? Tell me!""<br><br>""I'm not going to tell you,"" said Mike with a sneer. ""At least not right now. But I will say this: don't put too much into those scribbles on that blackboard."" Anna followed his gaze and looked back at the words on the board again: they seemed familiar somehow, but then again they didn't...it was so hard to remember what she'd seen before this moment...<br><br>""Are you going to let me go soon?"" asked Anna as she glanced back at Mike's face and saw nothing but rage there now; he seemed angrier than ever before, his eyes wild as he walked around behind her desk with quick steps. ""Where are you going?""<br><br>""I've got to get back to the meeting,"" he said, checking the time on his sleek, high-tech watch. ""Remember this place and what you see here when you look around,"" he whispered as he came back around her desk and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. ""And think of your daughter. I know you have her tucked away somewhere safe and sound, but just in case she doesn't stay safe...""<br><br>""What?"" asked Anna as she pushed his arms away from her. ""What is that supposed to mean? Tell me!""<br><br>""It means what it means,"" said Mike; he was standing only a foot away from her now, one hand on her desk and the other leaning on a wall for support, but Anna couldn't help but notice how unhealthy he looked. He was covered in sweat, his eyes surrounded by dark circles that were so prominent that they even showed up through his make-up; something was definitely wrong with him...otherwise...why else would a man like him stand close enough for Anna to touch him? He'd already told her about why people like them were there; it didn't make any sense for him to act like this unless something had gone terribly wrong... ""I wish I",1
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"friends, and she had stopped taking part in the activities she used to enjoy doing in her spare time. Shannon was spending more time alone at home because her father didn’t seem interested in doing anything with her, and so it seemed as though she had no one else to turn to but herself. “She’s trying to cope with her loss, and I don’t think she’s learned to do that yet,” Uncle Jeff said.<br><br>Shannon was sitting on the edge of her bed, holding a box of oil paints that was given to her by her mother before she passed away from cancer. She started crying uncontrollably once again upon seeing both her uncle and father approach her room slowly. “What are you doing here?” Shannon asked, wiping the tears from her face and standing up. There were paint stains on her cheeks, nose and hands. Her uncle could see that she had been crying for a while.<br><br>“I came to talk to you,” her father said.<br><br>“About what?” Shannon asked, turning away from them. She started pacing around the room as she spoke. “You don’t care how I feel, so why should I tell you?” she asked.<br><br>Her father stepped inside the room and placed a hand on her shoulder. “I do care about how you feel daughter,” he said softly. Her uncle noticed that there were small tears forming in her father’s eyes.<br><br>“Yeah, right. If you did care, you wouldn’t have left us all behind to deal with this grief on our own,” she said, turning to face her father directly now. She looked in his eyes and saw that he had started crying now. “He doesn’t care.” She turned to face her uncle now. “You don’t care either, do you?”<br><br>Her uncle sighed and shook his head slowly. He did care, but he knew that she wouldn’t believe him just yet. “No, I do care Shannon,” he said gently.<br><br>She looked at him for a few moments while the tears continued to fall from her father’s eyes and then nodded and walked over to sit on her bed. The two men stood nearby, unsure of what to do next. Her father was crying now,  so he didn’t know how to handle this situation.<br><br>Shannon saw the box of oil paints on her nightstand. She picked it up and opened it slowly, letting the tears continue to stream down her face as she did so. She stared at the empty canvas in front of her for a few moments before she took out a large brush and dipped it into a small jar of red paint. Then, Shannon started to paint.<br><br>She started painting out of her own grief and loneliness, but as she worked, she found that somehow painting helped to ease it. She painted for hours and didn’t eat anything. Shannon’s need to paint became so strong that she decided to clear out her attic and turn it into a studio, so that she could paint there whenever she felt like it.<br><br>She turned her old wooden desk into a workbench and filled the walls with canvases, paints, brushes, and other painting materials. Shannon moved her easel to the center of the room and placed two chairs in front of it. She hung some potted plants in the corners of the room for decoration purposes. The attic was small, but she didn’t mind that. It was just right for her. It also reminded  her of the attic in the family’s old barn.<br><br>Shannon would spend hours in the studio, painting and listening to music on her headphones. She discovered that drawing people helped her to feel connected with her mother once more, and so she would draw portraits of her mother over and over again. The  act of drawing also helped Shannon to cope with her feelings.<br><br>Shannon started to put her own feelings into the paintings, too. She could often be found staring at one of her own unfinished paintings, which had two figures standing in a meadow. The figures were very dark and pale, reflecting Shannon’s feelings of being filled with darkness but also feeling a glimmer of light at the same time.<br><br>This painting became an outlet for Shannon and she would often sit and stare at it for long periods of time to try to work some of her pain and confusion out on it. Sometimes, she would cover the painted surface with salt and trace the outlines of her paintings in a faint blue wash. This felt like she was connecting with someone, especially since her own mother could no longer speak to her. Shannon felt as if she were having a conversation with her mother by painting the images over and over again. Shannon started to feel closer to her paintings and knew that they helped her to heal.<br><br>Shannon painted for hours every day, with only a short break for lunch which she always ate while standing up. She drank a lot of water so that she wouldn’t feel weak or tired. She felt almost as peaceful as when she was painting and felt that it was her therapy. Shannon painted every night until she finished a painting, and then she would start a new one. Sometimes, she would paint for six hours straight without stopping, and this helped to ease the pain in her heart. Sometimes, while painting, Shannon felt like",1
Natalie goes to the police and helps them apprehend Trevor Lockwood before he can hurt anyone else .,"interacting at once, some of them will have to be turned into background characters. The outline is for this very reason; it eliminates the need to include everything in your story which is not necessary by just making a note of what you want to show in each scene and with these notes, you can draw up a better idea of how everything will look overall.<br><br>If done correctly, an outline is an extremely useful guide; it enables you to fill out missing scenes and details as well as eliminate any parts that don't fit your story and do not need to be told in detail. It's also something that helps you keep track of all of the information without having to worry about whether or not the notes are accurate if they aren't completely filled out; if there's a part that doesn't have a description or name for something when the outline is finished, then it means there's something missing or that this particular element isn't needed at all. The goal here is to create something flexible so that it can still be followed if someone decides to change things around during writing/drawing/animating; if this is achieved properly, your outline will be much more effective and easier to work with overall. However, sometimes things can change as well and sometimes even though you've followed your outline to the letter, you can find yourself changing things later on down the line for your own reasons.<br><br>Perspective is Everything<br><br>One of the most important things you need to focus on when creating an outline is who you're writing it from. Are you writing it in first person or third person? Are you writing it in past tense or present tense? The perspective has a huge impact on how your story will end up looking; which one are you going to use and why? This is something that requires a bit of thought and time because not only do they affect what kind of story you tell, they also affect the way your characters interact with one another as well as how they act. Before I even consider who I will write my stories from or what kind of tense my stories will be written in, I decide if I want them to be created from first person or third person perspective and then I work with that decision from there; if I decide to use first person, then the story will be told by me for lack of a better word because the narration comes directly from my character. Writing first person usually makes for an interesting perspective change but it also has its own problems; for example: What if my character talks about how she thinks her life sucks? Does that make me look bad as an author? If your character is a girl who has to deal with having an abusive boyfriend, even if she doesn't condone it, will other people automatically assume that you're trying to say that domestic abuse is okay? These are all things you need to take into consideration when writing in first person.<br><br>On the other hand, writing in third person perspective is a bit more forgiving and (in my opinion) a lot easier to work with; it doesn't directly show what's happening inside my characters' minds but it does show everything else through the use of body language and facial expression. In this case, I can write about how my characters are feeling without needing to actually say anything about it; for instance: When something bad happens between Natalie and Trevor and Natalie's friends ask her what happened, she can just look away from them without saying anything at all. Third person perspective also seems more logical since there's the whole idea of being able to tell what your characters are thinking without them actually having to narrate their thoughts for you. It sounds strange but it's a lot easier than having first person narration where I have to write as if I'm talking directly to the reader or having limited narrations which basically means only having your characters think about things I have no way of knowing or writing my stories in a ""voice"" that doesn't really seem like anything.<br><br>Of course, there are other options as well such as writing a story from the perspective of an outside narrator or having parts where you focus on the life of your characters and then go back to the beginning and start over with a different point of view. Both methods work well but I find that it is better to stick with one perspective and follow it through until the end. If you're going to use first person, then make sure every part of your outline is in first person; if you switch midway through, then chances are you might end up confusing yourself and worse case scenario, you won't be able to determine whether or not you're making sense anymore.<br><br>Something else to keep in mind is asking yourself what kind of tone you want for your story; this includes deciding if your characters should be sarcastic while they're talking (if they are, are they talking that way because they're frustrated?) or if they should simply be more serious than usual (if so, how would their tone change if something bad happened?). This applies especially when working with comedy because the characters' tones will play a huge part in how their jokes are presented and whether or not they should actually be funny or if it's better to leave them serious.<br><br>----------------------<br><br>? Choosing the right POV can make or break a story and you don't want to find out that it's the latter on your own. So make sure to take the time to think about what kind of perspective you want before you get started on your outline. After all, writing is a lot like cooking: You can't expect anything good to come out of it if you don't put in the right ingredients.<br><br>? Next time, we'll go over how to create a character (and even how to select which one of them will be the main ""star"" of your story). Until then!<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>? You may have noticed that I used several phrases in this chapter that I didn't explain such as: ""First person perspectives"" or ""third person perspectives."" While these are relatively simple terms, I didn't define them because this would change what I'm trying to preach here: Think before you act because while planning may seem like an unnecessary step, it is actually something that truly changes everything. It makes what you're doing feel more natural and it will help you",0
Julia Martin starts to experience terrifying visions.,"<br><br>""Ain't never been the same since that night my dear!"" The old woman is busy spreading her cards on the table and shuffling them around. She looks at you with a sly grin and shows you her cards. ""You're about to meet a stranger…yes, I'm telling you dear, you're about to meet a stranger.""<br><br>You look at the old woman with dislike in your eyes and grit your teeth. Of all the things you despise, psychics are definitely on the top of your list.<br><br>""Listen to me,"" she said poking you in the arm with a boney finger that sends shivers down your spine. ""You've got spirit dear; this isn't normal,"" she looks up from her cards and studies you carefully. ""Something is going to happen, something big.""<br><br>The old woman points to one of the cards which shows an old man with long white hair and beard sitting behind his desk, his eyes half closed as if he's sleeping. He's holding a book in one hand and resting his head on it with fingers touching his forehead. You peer closer waiting for some kind of revelation but nothing comes; it just looks like an old man in a pose where he's tired or bored.<br><br>""That's a difficult one dear,"" the old woman says wrinkling her face. ""But if there's one thing I'm sure of it is that you're waiting for something to happen.""<br><br>You stare at her with eyes the size a dinner plates and your mouth hanging open.<br><br>""Oh, yes! It will come true, very soon…"" She smiles and murmurs something that sounds like ""a stranger from afar.""<br><br>You look at her with shock in your eyes; you're still speechless. The old woman stops shuffling her cards and looks at you with dark, serious eyes. ""It won't be easy to accept the truth and nothing good ever comes easy dear."" She continues to shuffle the cards again, placing them neatly on the table in front of her. She reaches for them with both hands but before she does she looks straight at you and speaks again in a hushed voice. ""There will be blood...and death is coming..."" She taps one card three times before she puts it back on the table and looks at you again as if she's staring into your soul; her eyes are shining brightly even though they're slightly clouded by cataracts, almost as if they're not really there.<br><br>You feel your heart racing and you wish you were back in bed, instead of having this strange encounter. ""You're right,"" you say. ""We'll see; I hope this is not true.""<br><br>The old woman smiles at you and continues what she was doing; meanwhile you're trying hard to make sense of it all. There is something about the old woman's predictions that makes you feel uneasy, and although she can't tell the future, there's something about her that's just not quite right.<br><br>The leer on her face that seems so intense now doesn't match those soft, gentle eyes. She could give lessons to an actor who played a part in a horror movie, but then again maybe that's exactly what she was doing…acting? You don't know for sure...<br><br>Just then, your phone rings and interrupts your thoughts! You grab it out of your pocket as fast as possible and look at the caller ID; it reads: Julia Martin - Mom. You sigh hoping nothing bad has happened, nothing has ever come easy after all…<br><br>Robinson stood still looking at the building before him; he stared through the windows noticing how dirty they were, but he saw them anyway. He could hear the sound of crying babies and shouting mothers as he walked closer to the house; his steps were heavy, making a loud noise with each step. There was a light shining in one corner, standing out among the dark. As he got closer to the place his thoughts became darker…<br><br>Robinson is standing in front of you, looking at you with those dark eyes and smiling; he's telling you something: ""It's time my dear."" You don't know what's happening but it still feels like a dream.<br><br>Your vision blurs, everything around you starts to move backwards and then goes black...<br><br>""Don't worry dear, I'm here,"" an old woman says to you in a hushed voice. You feel her hands on your shoulder and her wrinkled face is close to your own…she whispers something else but you can't quite make it out…<br><br>There is movement all around you, everything looks blurred and out of focus. You can see people moving here and there but nothing seems real or normal anymore…Everything is unreal; there are loud crashes like thunder accompanied by flashes of light that flicker to life inside your head…you feel dizzy…and then a strange sensation starts to overcome you.<br><br>You can feel yourself stepping into another dimension, one that is neither here nor there, it's a weird feeling, like being inside of a great storm… and then you fall.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>""Julia!"" You hear your mother calling for you. You're still standing up in the attic but now you can see her from where you are; she's standing downstairs in the entrance hall looking up at you with an angry look on her face. Her eyes are cold as if they were made of ice. ""Are you going to stand around all day or are you going to get down and help with cleaning the house?"" She asks; her voice is cold and sharp, practically cutting through the air. A shiver runs down your spine at the sound of it. The door slams behind her and soon everything goes quiet again just as if nothing had happened…<br><br>You take a deep breath and try to shake off your foolish thoughts from before; that was only your imagination playing tricks on you again, Julia! You think to yourself as you make your way down the stairs, there is nothing out of place here; everything is fine. But then why do I feel so strange...? You ask yourself <br><br>""Ain't never been the same since that night my dear!"" The old woman is busy spreading her cards on the table and shuffling them around. She looks at you with a sly grin and shows you her cards. ""You're about to meet a stranger…yes, I'm telling you dear, you're about to meet a stranger.""<br><br>You look at the old woman with dislike in your eyes and grit your teeth. Of all the things you despise, psychics are definitely on the top of your list.<br><br>""Listen to me,"" she said poking you in the arm with a boney finger that sends shivers down your spine. ""You've got spirit dear; this isn't normal,"" she looks up from her cards and studies you carefully. ""Something is going to happen, something big.""<br><br>The old woman points to one of the cards which shows an old man with long white hair and beard sitting behind his desk, his eyes half closed as if he's sleeping. He's holding a book in one hand and resting his head on it with fingers touching his forehead. You peer closer waiting for some kind of revelation but nothing comes; it just looks like an old man in a pose where he's tired or bored.<br><br>""That's a difficult one dear,"" the old woman says wrinkling her face. ""But if there's one thing I'm sure of it is that you're waiting for something to happen.""<br><br>You stare at her with eyes the size a dinner plates and your mouth hanging open.<br><br>""Oh, yes! It will come true, very soon…"" She smiles and murmurs something that sounds like ""a stranger from afar.""<br><br>You look at her with shock in your eyes; you're still speechless. The old woman stops shuffling her cards and looks at you with dark, serious eyes. ""It won't be easy to accept the truth and nothing good ever comes easy dear."" She continues to shuffle the cards again, placing them neatly on the table in front of her. She reaches for them with both hands but before she does she looks straight at you and speaks again in a hushed voice. ""There will be blood...and death is coming..."" She taps one card three times before she puts it back on the table and looks at you again as if she's staring into your soul; her eyes are shining brightly even though they're slightly clouded by cataracts, almost as if they're not really there.<br><br>You feel your heart racing and you wish you were back in bed, instead of having this strange encounter. ""You're right,"" you say. ""We'll see; I hope this is not true.""<br><br>The old woman smiles at you and continues what she was doing; meanwhile you're trying hard to make sense of it all. There is something about the old woman's predictions that makes you feel uneasy, and although she can't tell the future, there's something about her that's just not quite right.<br><br>The leer on her face that seems so intense now doesn't match those soft, gentle eyes. She could give lessons to an actor who played a part in a horror movie, but then again maybe that's exactly what she was doing…acting? You don't know for sure...<br><br>Just then, your phone rings and interrupts your thoughts! You grab it out of your pocket as fast as possible and look at the caller ID; it reads: Julia Martin - Mom. You sigh hoping nothing bad has happened, nothing has ever come easy after all…<br><br>Robinson stood still looking at the building before him; he stared through the windows noticing how dirty they were, but he saw them anyway. He could hear the sound of crying babies and shouting mothers as he walked closer to the house; his steps were heavy, making a loud noise with each step. There was a light shining in one corner, standing out among the dark. As he got closer to the place his thoughts became darker…<br><br>Robinson is standing in front of you, looking at you with those dark eyes and smiling; he's telling you something: ""It's time my dear."" You don't know what's happening but it still feels like a dream.<br><br>Your vision blurs, everything around you starts to move backwards and then goes black...<br><br>""Don't worry dear, I'm here,"" an old woman says to you in a hushed voice.

Posted: Feb 6, 2013 - 4:19 PM By: Ron Hardcastle (Member)<br><br>I don't know how ""the business is"" these days, but years ago when it was common practice for studios to make deals with agents -- usually 10% of their clients' salaries -- and then to pay the agents for the privilege of taking on the client's work, at some point it got around that if you could have a client who could make a studio money under any circumstances, the deal was even better. Enter, years ago, a novel by an English author -- can't remember his name off-hand -- whose novel was then republished in America by one of the major publishing houses. The novel was not as dull and dreary as its predecessor, so there was reason to be encouraged. Then they discovered that the author's ""agent"" (no signatures were ever produced) had negotiated a deal (in the back room with no other participants) whereby the author got 10% of all profits on any film version of his book.<br><br>The book did not do well in England; I don't know if it was published elsewhere or if it sold enough copies in this country to warrant an American publication. And even if so, no publishing house wanted to take on this story which would have cost them millions in advance advances to put out, because there just wasn't much of a chance that they would ever see any return from it.<br><br>So now studios are cautious about deals with ""novelists"" who, for one reason or another, do not get the kind of career-boosting recognition that might justify a big investment.<br><br>In the end, I think it comes down to the fact that a studio (or any business) must be regarded by its investors as being solvent and able to survive economically in order to attract investors. Investors don't want to risk their own money on a business that has very little chance of surviving.<br><br>And so we're left with nothing but musicals and superheroes!<br><br>Hardcastle, my sources are often on the record. But I can neither reveal them nor repeat what they said on the record. (I have enough trouble with my taxes as it is.)<br><br>But here's another off-the-record story -- I cannot give you all details because the contract is sealed.<br><br>Last year a well-known screenwriter and producer sold a book manuscript to a major publishing house. The contract was signed in the presence of both his agent and his manager. It was then forwarded to the production side of his agency, who took out part of it and forwarded it to a studio with whom they had a prior relationship with, at which time the studio then came back and made certain changes in it that were covered by their own talent deals lawyers. The writer's manager knew about these changes although not about their ramifications, but for some reason he never told his client about them, even after he saw another version of the contract which removed all references to this producer or project going to this particular studio, apparently because their planned production schedule conflicted with something else going on with them at that studio. So when he retired from management years later and those producers came back looking for him to help them find another agent for this movie, he told them he had no idea who the new agent was, and let them go to the then-present management agency for production deals.<br><br>The writer's former manager was never on the writer's pension plan (not because of the contract -- that would have been illegal -- but because of finances) and he died of cancer many years ago. The writer became a client of that agency in their production deals department, and it took them several years to even realize what he had been regarding as a ""live"" book project all that time. Then they went back to his old deal with the publishing house, realized it was still valid, even though it had never been activated by them (they didn't know about it), and sold the book for something like $400,000 to one of our major studios.<br><br>So now there is another film in production -- one more than I'm quite sick of seeing -- which at least has a chance of getting made now. Hardcastle: And so we're left with nothing but musicals and superheroes! That may be true - but nothing new is coming out anyway! Suckers' choice!<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>19 PM By: Ron Hardcastle (Member)<br><br>Re: A NOTE FROM HARDCASTLE: BUT HE DREAMS ON!<br><br>For those of you who were at the Hollywood Bowl last night, I can report that James Newton Howard came out to a rousing ovation and played wonderfully with his band.<br><br>As always, I was especially mesmerized when he performed the big, brass-backed theme from ""The Fugitive."" I've watched that movie maybe a dozen times since it was first released in 1993, and like it better each time. But until seeing the live performance last night of those themes, I had never realized how similar in style they are to the main theme from ""Batman Returns."" It made me realize that Danny Elfman has been using a lot of the same musical tricks in both scores -- though they're very different in story.<br><br>And Howard's playing wasn't at all like Elfman's; there was nothing like his version of ""The Fugee"" (with most of the melody played by trombone) which is one of my favorite passages. And since Jack Nitzsche was also living when recording for this film, perhaps Howard also felt more freedom to play more jazz-influenced passages as well. (That's not",0
Jennifer decides to leave her family and start a new life.,"Well, your daddy and I are getting divorced. You won’t live with us anymore - not right now. Mama will look after you for awhile.”<br><br>Lily twisted around on Jennifer’s lap to look up into her eyes. Her dark brown eyes were full of concern and confusion. “But, but where will we live?”<br><br>“You and me, baby girl - just you and me. We have our own house now.” Jennifer laughed awkwardly, wiping away tears that had begun to form in her eyes again. “Mama has a new job, too.”<br><br>Lily was confused. She didn’t understand what Jennifer was saying. “Where are we going to live? We don’t have a house – not yet. Are we going to live in an apartment?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled, then took a deep breath before she filled them in. “No honey,” she began. “We bought our own house. You know how much I told you I wanted a backyard for the two of us? Well, I got it! We now live in a cul-de-sac, right by the park. It’s a real pretty neighborhood with lots of trees. We even have a swing in our front yard to play on.”<br><br>Lily was starting to understand what Jennifer was talking about, but something still didn’t add up. “Mama, I don’t understand. You said we were going to live at Grandma Jackie’s house.”<br><br>Lily sat up straight and looked at her mama with tear-filled eyes. “Can’t we go to Grandma Jackie? I like it there. What about the park? Can we still go to the park?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled, trying to hide her own tears. “Of course we can! We just don’t live in the same house anymore. We are still a family, just a different kind of family. I still love you as much as ever.”<br><br>Lily nodded and wiped her eyes. “I know, mama,” she started. “It’s just that I didn’t think daddy would do something like that. It was all so sudden, too. Now he won ’t even talk to me.”<br><br>Jennifer put her arm around Lily and pulled her close. “He probably doesn’t know what to say. You should try talking to him some more. I bet he wants you as much as ever. It takes time to get used to the changes.”<br><br>Lily pulled away and looked at Jennifer with a questioning face. “What changes?” she asked, her tone turning sarcastic. “You mean when daddy sells the old house and mama moves out?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled. “Maybe we can still come over and visit,” she said, moving toward the door.<br><br>Jennifer opened the door and moved into the hallway. She turned back to look at her daughter and smiled warmly. “Yes! You can move in with me for a while,” she said, trying to sound optimistic.  “I have a new job and you can go to the same school, and we’ll see how it goes. You might like living with me just as much.”<br><br>Lily shrugged. She had never liked change, but didn’t really have an opinion on this one way or another. “I guess so,” she said doubtfully. But her expression clearly showed her reluctance if Jennifer had looked closely enough.<br><br>Jennifer stepped out the door and walked down the stairs to the sidewalk below. The moving van was parked in front of her house, ready to take her furniture away. She turned back toward the side of the house and waved at her daughter, who was standing there with a group of children.<br><br>“Good-bye!” Jennifer called. Then she turned and moved to the front door across the street, where a middle-aged man stood waiting on the porch.<br><br>“Are you moving in?” the man asked.<br><br>“Yes, I am,” Jennifer answered. “You are moving out?”<br><br>“Yes, I am, too. You don’t look familiar. Are you moving to this neighborhood?”<br><br>“No, I moved from one street over, but I just started a new job and decided to move closer. Moving is such a hassle!”<br><br>The moving man laughed lightly. “I know what you mean. But at least it will be easier moving the rest of your stuff. Moving the big pieces is the worst part.”<br><br>“That’s true, but I want to move all my furniture to the new house today instead of dragging it here tomorrow and back again on Wednesday,” Jennifer said. “This way, I can unpack right away. Do you move furniture often?”<br><br>“Every couple of months. I moved a lot when I was younger, but now I prefer to stay in one place for years at a time. It saves me money, and it gives me more stability with my job. My wife prefers the same thing because moving is hard on the relationship. But it depends on our jobs. We move more when we get transferred to another city or state. Moving is such a hassle, but the longer you stay in one place the harder it is to move on short notice. It can be hard finding a new place if you have to move  quickly.”<br><br>The moving man stopped and picked up a picture frame. He was looking at Jennifer’s pictures of Samantha and Theresa as children, then he replaced the frame on the wall.<br><br>“Yeah, we have two kids, so we may move again in the next few years,” Jennifer said. “But we probably won’t move for a while after this, unless my husband gets transferred again. He’s not getting any younger, so who knows? It’s just nice to not have to move right now. I need some stability after everything that has happened.”<br><br>The moving man smiled and nodded his head in agreement.<br><br>“Moving is a hassle, but at least you can choose where to put everything in the new place. I don’t move very often, but when I do, it is fun to rearrange my stuff and make the place feel more like home. Moving is definitely stressful though. It’s hard to make friends if you move too often because it takes people longer to get to know you.”<br><br>The moving man grunted in response.<br><br>“Some people move all the time, and have a different group of friends at each place they move to. That way, they don’t really have to make any new friends. They already have a group of friends waiting for them wherever they go. That way, they don’t have to go through what you just did. They can move quickly from one place to the next. Moving is easier that way, especially if you have a big family. You can’t move so quickly when you are only moving some of your things, or when you are just moving yourself. Moving can be really easy if you plan ahead. It can also be hard though if you don’t plan ahead, or things don’t go according to your plan. Moving can be a hassle and stressful at times, but it can also be a lot of fun. You just have to know how to dealwith moving stress and keep things from getting too overwhelming.”<br><br>Another moving man came out of the house. He carried a small wooden table and two dining chairs to a nearby truck.<br><br>The moving man, Jennifer, and the other moving men stood at the side of the house as they continued to load and unload boxes from the truck. They moved quickly but carefully , keeping the tables and couches from hitting the walls or scratching the floors. They managed to fit all of Jennifer’s furniture into her small SUV, which had been loaded to the roof with boxes only moments before.<br><br>“Don’t worry, my friend. Everyone has their own methods for moving. If you think it is the right way to do things, then you keep doing it that way. If you want to make sure that everything gets put into place exactly how you want it, then that is what you do. It’s all about figuring out how your mind works and what works best for you. As long as it keeps working and you don’t keep moving, then you have a good way of doing things!”<br><br>The moving men smiled and nodded at Jennifer. They moved to the back of the truck and finished loading all of the furniture. The moving men packed everything into the truck with incredible skill and expert timing.<br><br>Jennifer moved to the passenger’s side of the SUV and picked up her bags. She walked back to side the house and noticed that three of the moving men were busy carrying box after box into the house, while a fourth was watching them from side a doorway. The moving man turned to watch Jennifer get into the side of the SUV.<br><br>“Hey! Why don’t you move in with us? We have some extra space right now and it would be nice to have another girl around. You can move in with us for as long as you need to, and we can move you into a different room when someone else needs to move in. We’re moving into a huge apartment later on and we don’t know anyone else yet. We’ll make sure that you are taken care of, okay?”<br><br>Moving men moved to back of the truck, and got into their side. They drove off towards the other end of the block, moving their way through traffic. Moving men had already done their previous moves and were heading to side their next move. Moving men were moving a lot today and had many moves lined up.<br><br>Jennifer moved back to side the door and thought for a moment.<br><br>This is Side Bar. This is where Jennifer will make her decision regarding moving in with the three moving men.<br><br>“I don’t know,” she said. “It sounds like a lot of responsibility. I don’t want to be a burden.”<br><br>“Don’t worry about it, we can handle it. Just say yes and come with us!”<br><br>Jennifer thought for a moment longer and then made her decision.<br><br>“Yes, I’ll move in with you.",1
Mary Smith walks home from work and becomes the victim of a mugging attempt by John Doe.,"The alley was dark. It was a short walk from the corner where Mary Smith had been walking, but she still didn’t trust it. Mary fidgeted the whole way, watching all around her for anyone who might be lurking in the shadows. She didn’t like this alley; it was dark and dusty and full of trash.<br><br>She crossed over to the other side, trying to get farther away from the alley’s entrance, but a group of teens were standing there smoking pot. They looked at her with smirks on their faces – they knew what Mary was doing and were probably laughing at her behind her back. One of them leaned over and grabbed Mary by the shoulders, demanding that she hand over whatever she had in her pockets.<br><br>Mary Smith stood rooted to the spot, unable to move as John Doe pushed into her personal space. He demanded that she empty her pockets right then and Mary Smith panicked. She dug for her purse in her bag, hoping that inside were some items of value that she could give him. Instead, she only came up with some receipts and a few coins. She hoped those would suffice, but John Doe demanded more.  He got angry when she told him that this was all she had.<br><br>“You were just at the corner shop!” he screamed at her. “Didn’t you just buy something?”<br><br>Mary Smith wanted to cry. When John Doe realized that Mary Smith wasn’t going to give him more money, he moved in closer to her. Then she noticed the gun in his hand and she began to tremble.<br><br>“If you don’t give me everything, I’ll kill you,” he threatened. <br><br>Mary Smith reached into her bag again, hoping there was something else she could find to appease him. She felt around in her purse and eventually, her hand connected with the contents of her wallet — which John Doe was now demanding she hand over. Mary Smith did as John Doe told her and handed him the contents of her wallet.<br><br>He demanded more money, but at this point, Mary Smith only had change. John Doe began to look through her wallet in search of more cash but what he found was a photograph. He stared at it for a moment and then turned toward Mary Smith once again. <br><br>“Give me your phone,” he demanded. “I know you have one.”<br><br>Mary Smith suddenly realized that she had been so caught up in not giving him any more money that she hadn’t even considered the possibility that John Doe might want to take her phone. John Doe became angry when he found no other valuables in Mary Smith’s pocket; he told her to turn over the contents of her purse and to empty her pockets, but she had already removed everything that she thought he could possibly want.<br><br>She searched through her bag again but all that was inside was her purse, a few receipts, and a pack of gum — none of which John Doe apparently wanted.<br><br>Mary Smith began to feel hopeless. Surely there was nothing left of her belongings that could be of any value to John Doe. She started to become angry herself — how dare John Doe demand more from her",1
Shannon's paintings help her to deal with her grief and to find a new sense of purpose.,"<br><br>Shannon finished wiping away her tears and looked at the canvases on the floor. “I think I really will appreciate them more now, but I don’t know what to do next. Should I put them away or hang them on the wall first?”<br><br>Rosemary thought for a minute. “You can put them in your studio later on. Besides the attic room was getting crowded and now you have a whole other place to work! You can put them up there when you get ready to move each canvas. Right now, I think we should try and get the attic finished first.”<br><br>Shannon looked at the unfinished attic with some sadness. “I know you are right about the attic being too small and I am excited about my new studio, but I will miss working in my old attic. It is where I used to paint all the time with my mom. The attic always held so many memories for me and now that she is gone, I can’t bring myself to clean it out. I have left everything just the way it was.” Shannon moved around in the attic and picked up a few of her mother’s paintings. She put them back down before moving on.<br><br>Shannon’s heart was filled with sadness as she moved down the attic stairs. She had finished cleaning out the room and had started moving the furniture to the studio earlier that day. She had moved her easel and paints, but still hadn’t decided on what  to do about all of her mother’s paintings. The attic was the last room in the house that needed to be cleaned out and Shannon knew she would have to go up there soon no matter how hard it was.<br><br>Shannon put her head in her hands, overwhelmed with sadness and grief. She sat down on the bottom step of the stairs and started crying. “I just wish I had more time with you mom! You were so amazing and I miss you so much!” Shannon covered her face with her hands hoping she wouldn’t cry as hard if she couldn’t see her tears.<br><br>A few minutes later, Shannon heard a soft knock on the door. She quickly wiped her tears and stood up slowly. She opened the door to see her dad standing outside with several large boxes of pizza in his hands.<br><br>“Hey Shan, how are you doing?” He stepped into the room and set the pizza boxes down.<br><br>Shannon wrapped her arms around him and started crying again. “I miss her so much! I can’t believe she is gone!”<br><br>“I know it is hard honey. It gets easier every day, but it also makes a little harder because you miss her so much.” He patted Shannon on the back and looked over her shoulder to see that the floor was already cleared out and she was in the middle of painting.<br><br>“Hey sis!” came a cheerful voice from behind Shannon and she was greeted by the smiling face of her older sister Sara. She walked into the room and brought with her a comforting scent of lavender. “How are you holding up?”<br><br>“I am okay, just missing her so much! I still can’t believe she is gone!” Shannon  cried.<br><br>“It’s okay, we miss her too. But it is going to get better every day, and you will gradually learn to cope with it. You just need something to focus on, something positive that will make you happy. I think painting would be a great way to keep your mind busy, and do something productive to keep your mind off of her. I love seeing what you do Shannon! It brings back so many good memories from when we were kids,” Sara smiled. “You really have a talent there honey, don’t ever forget that!” Shannon felt a ray of hope from her sister’s words and it lifted her spirits. She was determined to prove that she was just as good an artist as her mother had been.<br><br>Shannon felt motivated by the praise. She felt a sense of determination to get better, and try to create more sophisticated paintings. Shannon looked at the brushes that she had gotten from her father’s art supplies, and noticed how much better they were than hers. They were expensive art brushes that had the best quality paint on them. They were much finer than the ones she had been using for her projects, and allowed for more intricate  details.<br><br>Shannon set up a small table in her space in the attic, and started to prepare her palette for a new painting. She felt comfortable and at peace with herself out there, away from the world. The paint that came with the brushes was very high quality, and she was thrilled about experimenting with it. Shannon wanted to try and emulate the style of her mom’s paintings, even if she didn’t quite have the talent and skill yet. She wanted to do it just for her mom, because she knew that her mom would be so proud of her. Shannon hoped that by doing this, she could somehow feel closer to her mother again.<br><br>Shannon wanted to create more beautiful, bigger paintings like the one that hung in her bedroom. They had all of her favorite things about the city; pictures of cars and skyscrapers, as well as various people in different clothes walking around. It was as if Shannon’s mom had known that she would love the city, even though she had never been there herself.",1
Julia Martin starts to experience terrifying visions.,"<br><br>""Ain't never been the same since that night my dear!"" The old woman is busy spreading her cards on the table and shuffling them around. She looks at you with a sly grin and shows you her cards. ""You're about to meet a stranger…yes, I'm telling you dear, you're about to meet a stranger.""<br><br>You look at the old woman with dislike in your eyes and grit your teeth. Of all the things you despise, psychics are definitely on the top of your list.<br><br>""Listen to me,"" she said poking you in the arm with a boney finger that sends shivers down your spine. ""You've got spirit dear; this isn't normal,"" she looks up from her cards and studies you carefully. ""Something is going to happen, something big.""<br><br>The old woman points to one of the cards which shows an old man with long white hair and beard sitting behind his desk, his eyes half closed as if he's sleeping. He's holding a book in one hand and resting his head on it with fingers touching his forehead. You peer closer waiting for some kind of revelation but nothing comes; it just looks like an old man in a pose where he's tired or bored.<br><br>""That's a difficult one dear,"" the old woman says wrinkling her face. ""But if there's one thing I'm sure of it is that you're waiting for something to happen.""<br><br>You stare at her with eyes the size a dinner plates and your mouth hanging open.<br><br>""Oh, yes! It will come true, very soon…"" She smiles and murmurs something that sounds like ""a stranger from afar.""<br><br>You look at her with shock in your eyes; you're still speechless. The old woman stops shuffling her cards and looks at you with dark, serious eyes. ""It won't be easy to accept the truth and nothing good ever comes easy dear."" She continues to shuffle the cards again, placing them neatly on the table in front of her. She reaches for them with both hands but before she does she looks straight at you and speaks again in a hushed voice. ""There will be blood...and death is coming..."" She taps one card three times before she puts it back on the table and looks at you again as if she's staring into your soul; her eyes are shining brightly even though they're slightly clouded by cataracts, almost as if they're not really there.<br><br>You feel your heart racing and you wish you were back in bed, instead of having this strange encounter. ""You're right,"" you say. ""We'll see; I hope this is not true.""<br><br>The old woman smiles at you and continues what she was doing; meanwhile you're trying hard to make sense of it all. There is something about the old woman's predictions that makes you feel uneasy, and although she can't tell the future, there's something about her that's just not quite right.<br><br>The leer on her face that seems so intense now doesn't match those soft, gentle eyes. She could give lessons to an actor who played a part in a horror movie, but then again maybe that's exactly what she was doing…acting? You don't know for sure...<br><br>Just then, your phone rings and interrupts your thoughts! You grab it out of your pocket as fast as possible and look at the caller ID; it reads: Julia Martin - Mom. You sigh hoping nothing bad has happened, nothing has ever come easy after all…<br><br>Robinson stood still looking at the building before him; he stared through the windows noticing how dirty they were, but he saw them anyway. He could hear the sound of crying babies and shouting mothers as he walked closer to the house; his steps were heavy, making a loud noise with each step. There was a light shining in one corner, standing out among the dark. As he got closer to the place his thoughts became darker…<br><br>Robinson is standing in front of you, looking at you with those dark eyes and smiling; he's telling you something: ""It's time my dear."" You don't know what's happening but it still feels like a dream.<br><br>Your vision blurs, everything around you starts to move backwards and then goes black...<br><br>""Don't worry dear, I'm here,"" an old woman says to you in a hushed voice. You feel her hands on your shoulder and her wrinkled face is close to your own…she whispers something else but you can't quite make it out…<br><br>There is movement all around you, everything looks blurred and out of focus. You can see people moving here and there but nothing seems real or normal anymore…Everything is unreal; there are loud crashes like thunder accompanied by flashes of light that flicker to life inside your head…you feel dizzy…and then a strange sensation starts to overcome you.<br><br>You can feel yourself stepping into another dimension, one that is neither here nor there, it's a weird feeling, like being inside of a great storm… and then you fall.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>""Julia!"" You hear your mother calling for you. You're still standing up in the attic but now you can see her from where you are; she's standing downstairs in the entrance hall looking up at you with an angry look on her face. Her eyes are cold as if they were made of ice. ""Are you going to stand around all day or are you going to get down and help with cleaning the house?"" She asks; her voice is cold and sharp, practically cutting through the air. A shiver runs down your spine at the sound of it. The door slams behind her and soon everything goes quiet again just as if nothing had happened…<br><br>You take a deep breath and try to shake off your foolish thoughts from before; that was only your imagination playing tricks on you again, Julia!

"Valerie Marx wakes up in a dark basement, bound and gagged.","<br><br>The basement was dark and oppressive, even before Valerie Marx awakened. Her mind swam with questions, but her voice caught in her throat and would not speak. She could see nothing except the strange, dull shapes that surrounded her.

Valerie makes it to safety and the police catch John Doe.,"a tight left turn as soon as she reached the stairs.<br><br>John Doe had thought that he would have been able to see Valerie Marx from the side of the house before then, but he had been wrong about that. There was no one in sight when Valerie ran away from him. This was a bad situation for Valerie because John Doe knew that she was in trouble. Her chances of surviving the night were slim to none, and John Doe had no intention of letting her get away with her life, so he decided that there was no point in following her.<br><br>Valerie Marx had successfully escaped from John Doe, but she wasn ’t safe yet because he could catch up with her at any moment. The police were just around the corner, and she was walking towards them even though she didn’t see them. It only took a few minutes for her to reach the police station since it was only a block away from her house, but John Doe could have easily caught up with her by then if he was able to move as fast as he did before, which would allow him to be close enough to kill her when she reached the police station.<br><br>Valerie Marx did not see the police when she arrived at the station because they were around a corner and around a car. This was good for John Doe because he had less of a chance of being spotted by them as long as he kept moving to the right side of the police station. It was also good for him because it gave him more time to think about what should be done next.<br><br>The police station might have been safe for Valerie, but it was not a safe place for John Doe to be because they would be able to easily see him if he went inside. They might have also been able to find out who he was from the information that he left behind in the basement. If they were  able to do that, then he might have ended up being under more suspicion than before. Because of those reasons, it was better for him to just keep running for now and wait until things cooled off before taking another victim.<br><br>If Valerie Marx walked inside the police station, then she would be safe from John Doe for now because the police would surround her and keep her from harm. On the other hand, Valerie did not want to go into the police station because she had more important places to go.<br><br>Male Celebrity A was not at the police station when Valerie Marx arrived there because he had gone to Valerie’s house to make sure she was safe. When Valerie arrived at her house, Male Celebrity A was already there. He took Valerie inside her house and locked the door so that John Doe could not get in. Male Celebrity A talked with Valerie while they were inside her home and comforted her as she went through what had just happened to her.<br><br>Valerie was glad when Male Celebrity A arrived because she had been starting to feel alone and scared after moving house and changing jobs. She explained everything that happened in the basement to Male Celebrity A, including how she got there and why she was moving house. She told Male Celebrity A how scared she had been and how she was moving house because of the situation with John Doe, but also because her old apartment building was right next to an old graveyard. Valerie was in a bad way because moving house like that would make anyone feel alone, and she needed someone to support her through that kind of ordeal. <br><br>Male Celebrity A listened to everything Valerie said without saying anything for a long time. After he finished listening, he said that Valerie had done a brave thing when she went into the basement to confront John Doe.<br><br>Male Celebrity A was very happy when he heard what Valerie had done. He did not think it would be brave to visit a murderer in a dark basement, but Male Celebrity A knew that Valerie had wanted to do that and was happy that she did.<br><br>Male Celebrity A told Valerie that she was very brave because she had stood up to the killer after waking up tied up, without being able to move or speak. He said that it was a very scary thing to do, but she had done it and was safe now.<br><br>Valerie Marx was happy to hear what Male Celebrity A said. It made her feel better about herself and the situation.",1
"Mary Smith, George Smith, Jessica Doe, and John Doe all give testimony in court and John Doe is ultimately convicted and sent to prison.","Wilkinson. Jessica Doe repeated what her husband had said to her about the mugging that night. The only differences between their accounts was that Jessica said George Smith used a gun while John Doe said he used a knife; and that George Smith punched John in the face while John said he just hit him with his fist. Karen Wilkinson thanked her for her time and left her house.<br><br>Karen Wilkinson next went to the police station to get Louise Spencer’s notes on George Smith’s previous interview. She found that Louise had done extensive research on George Smith and had discovered many of his financial troubles. She also found out that he had moved a lot in his life, having moved at least five times in the past ten years.<br><br>Louise Spencer was waiting for her in the interrogation room. She was a tall, dark-haired woman who was very attractive. She had a stern look but she was very polite and professional when they moved into the room. The only furnishings in the room were two plastic chairs placed in front of a small table.<br><br>“Thank you for coming by, Miss Wilkinson. I had hoped to question you earlier, but the interrogation ran longer than expected.”<br><br>“No problem,” said Karen. It was obvious that Louise Spencer was trying hard to make her comfortable during this interrogation.<br><br>“Let us begin then, shall we?” said Louise. “Where were you coming from the night of the mugging?”<br><br>“I was coming from my job at the grocery store. They close the doors at 9 o’clock and I usually try to leave a little early so that I can get there before they lock up the doors. On this particular night, it was hard to leave on time because Mr. Smith and I were having an argument when we got home about his moving to another state. We have been trying to move to another state for the last couple of years but always end up staying here for some reason or another.”<br><br>“Moving to another state seems like a big step. Why do you want to move?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I have a good job here and I don’t want to move away, but my husband wants to move and so we have discussed it over and over again. But he wouldn’t listen to what I had to say this time either, so I  left the house without telling him and decided to walk home because I needed some air.”<br><br>“What did Mr. Smith say when you told him that you were leaving?” asked Louise.<br><br>“He started shouting that I was being disrespectful and then he called me a damn fool!”<br><br>“And what did you do when he said that?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I shouted back at him, but before I knew it he had his gun pointed at me and was demanding my money.”<br><br>Louise looked at George for a long time before she continued.<br><br>“I have a lot of questions about this, Mr. Smith, but before we carry on I need to know whether or not you think Mr. Doe will be convicted for this crime?”<br><br>“I don’t think so, no! He has done this sort of thing before and they let him go,” said George.<br><br>“Why do you think that he will be convicted this time?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I mean, it isn’t like I would really know anything about these things, is it? Do you think he’ll be convicted?” said George.<br><br>Louise was silent for a few seconds.<br><br>“From what I can gather, Mr. Doe has been in trouble before and is often brought in for questioning, but he has never been convicted of anything before now. From what I can tell he’s a drug addict and is involved with some kind of gang or something, and that is what the police have been focusing on so far. We have evidence to suggest that he has an arrest record for stealing money from other people. I don’t know if you have read the news lately, but this has been going on for quite a while and we have proof that this is not the first time that he has stolen from someone,” said Louise.<br><br>George was silent for a while before speaking again.<br><br>“This is ridiculous! He isn’t going to be convicted for taking some money from a woman who was walking down the street! This is a joke, right?” said George.<br><br>Louise paused again before responding.<br><br>“I mean, it isn’t a joke, I will be prosecuting him in court on Monday. There is evidence that he committed the  crime and we have you as a witness who saw it happen, so I don’t see how we can lose. We just need to make sure that John Doe has no opportunity to sway the jury to think otherwise,” said Louise.<br><br>“Seriously though, he wasn’t even trying to kill her or anything. If he had wanted to hurt her, he would have done it much more quickly, wouldn’t he? I don’t see how this is going to result in a conviction. What is the worst case scenario for him? I mean, if we were able to come up with some kind of arrangement with the judge or something, couldn’t we make this all go away? I’d be willing to pay a little bit of money to make sure this doesn’t go any further,” said George.<br><br>Louise Spencer paused again before responding. She moved her fingers across the table, drumming them on its surface as she thought about what to say.<br><br>“I appreciate that you are concerned for John Doe’s well-being here, but we can’t let payment dictate who we prosecute and how seriously we do it. This office has a responsibility to the entire community. We aren’t here to serve the interests of private individuals or corporations—we are here to uphold the law and ensure justice for all,” she said.<br><br>“Okay, I understand that this office has an obligation to the community or whatever, but if you think about it, sending him to jail will only make things worse for him. You have to understand—I wasn’t there when they moved him to this office from the precinct, but a lot of his friends were. They said that he was pretty out of it when they put him in this room. They said they had to strap him down in a chair and he was drooling and foaming at the mouth. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that moving him from the cell to this office probably didn’t do him any good. Right? I mean, if you’re going to move him here, at least move him to a room where he can lie down. Or give him something to drink or something. Don’t just leave him here to rot, you know?”<br><br>Louise Spencer considered this statement for a moment before responding, “I don’t know what  happened when they moved him here, but this office can’t be responsible for the care of criminals. He was apprehended and brought here based on the evidence collected by police officers. The law says he should be prosecuted and that is exactly what we are going to do. There is no excuse for what he did, and the court will rule accordingly. And if you really care about this man, you’ll do your best to help him in court.”<br><br>Tony Wagner stared solemnly at his client for a few seconds before speaking. “You know, not once did you mention that John Doe has been charged with a crime. You didn’t even acknowledge that he’s in this room because of what happened on the street. I think you might want to say something about that.”<br><br>Louise raised her eyebrows and walked over to the window separating them from the courtroom. “Forget it. We all know why John Doe is here. He’s being charged with attempted murder, and if they don’t convict him, the court system has gone to hell in a handbasket, that’s all I have to say.”<br><br>They moved back into the office and sat down. Their conversation was interrupted by Judge Spencer, who burst through the door, leaving a trail of papers behind him. He looked like he was ready to tear someone apart at the seams for stepping on his paper trail. “Court is starting in five minutes and everybody  needs to be there!”<br><br>Tony nodded his head, acknowledging the papers and then said, “Louise, you should probably go.”<br><br>She stood up and looked out the window. “I’m not going to that trial. I’m not prosecuting John Doe. I’m not calling any of the witnesses. But this case isn’t just about John Doe. It’s about Mary Smith, too. It’s about all of us, and how we treat each other in this city—and I didn’t see you doing anything to help Mary Smith when she was walking home last night.”<br><br>Tony was surprised. “What—what are you talking about? What are you talking about, Louise? This is a trial, don’t get crazy.”<br><br>She turned back to face him. “I want to tell Mary Smith’s story. I want to get up there and talk about how she lives with her husband in a tiny apartment that’s falling down around them, and she has to walk home at night by herself because they can’t afford a taxi or a car or even a good pair of shoes—is that crazy enough for you?”<br><br>Tony didn’t know what to say. He said, “I don’t think so. It sounds like you are going off on a tangent here, and I don’t think this is the right way to go about this.”<br><br>Louise was quiet for a moment, then said, “I’ve talked to Jessica Doe. She needs to be heard in all this too. You know she can’t speak English. She barely speaks at all, in fact—and now she’s in the jury room waiting for this verdict to come down and it doesn’t even seem to have occurred to any of you that she might hear what we say here today. Well it occurred to Jessica, and I thought you should know that. She heard everything you said yesterday. She heard everything Mary Smith said today . And she’s expecting us to give it her straight—not like a bunch of lawyers in a bar playing parlor games.”<br><br>Tony said nothing but stood there looking at Louise, his mouth hanging open. “Are you saying that you think she can understand English?”<br><br>Louise shook her head. “No. I’m saying that she is listening to everything very carefully and she has a right to an accounting of everything we do here today. She is your client’s wife, Tony, and this isn’t just about protecting John Doe from her influence, trust me. John Doe is not the only one in this room who needs protection from the people he loves.”<br><br>Tony Wagner had no response to that and turned toward the jury box. “Your Honor, will you please instruct them to wait outside for a few minutes while I talk to counsel?” John Doe looked confused by this request.<br><br>Louise shook Tony Wagner’s arm and tried to drag him the last few steps back to her bench, but he resisted her efforts and turned on his heels toward the jury box instead.<br><br>John Doe was confused by this request.  “Your Honor, may I ask the witness some questions?”<br><br>Tony Wagner ignored John Doe and continued to stare at Louise as his mouth twisted into a sneer. “Louise, as one of the brightest young lawyers I know, you know full well that Mr. Doe is not allowed to cross-examine Mrs. Smith. Our rules are perfectly clear on this point: neither the defendant nor anyone in his family is allowed to question any of the witnesses against him.” He paused and looked pointedly at John Doe for a moment before adding, “That would include a spouse.”<br><br>Louise did not respond, but her eyes narrowed behind the lenses of her glasses as she tried to keep herself under control.<br><br>The judge looked over his glasses in irritation. “Defense counsel, let’s make this simple: you know the rules just as well as I do; there will be no more interruptions.”<br><br>Tony Wagner nodded his agreement and turned back to face the jury with a look of contempt on his face. “George Smith, do you remember your testimony from yesterday?”<br><br>“Yes, I remember it very well.” George Smith shifted nervously in his seat, but spoke in a clear voice.<br><br>George Smith testified that he saw the entire incident and that he was certain that the person who had tried to mug his wife was John Doe. He testified that he had seen it all clearly due to the fact that it had happened right in front of his face .<br><br>The prosecutor rested his case, and John Doe’s lawyer made a last-minute effort to convince the judge that there was one more witness they wanted to call. It was only after a moment’s hesitation that the judge reluctantly agreed.<br><br>George Smith sat down as a young man entered the courtroom and walked up to the witness stand. He was someone Tony Wagner had mentioned in his opening statement, but Mary and Jessica had never seen him before.<br><br>The young man cleared his throat and took off his glasses as he began to speak. “My name is Jeffrey Black, and I used to be the prison guard who was assigned to supervise John Doe before he was moved from our cellblock to solitary confinement.”<br><br>“What did you do with John Doe?” The judge asked.<br><br>“At first, we moved him to a holding cell near the entrance of the prison so that his case could be investigated. After that, he was transferred to a cellblock in solitary confinement and kept there until we received orders to transfer him elsewhere, which we did a few months back.”<br><br>“Did you ever speak with John Doe?” Tony Wagner asked.<br><br>“Yes, I did. He was a model prisoner, always following the rules and maintaining a positive attitude.",1

Posted: Feb 6, 2013 - 4:19 PM By: Ron Hardcastle (Member)<br><br>I don't know how ""the business is"" these days, but years ago when it was common practice for studios to make deals with agents -- usually 10% of their clients' salaries -- and then to pay the agents for the privilege of taking on the client's work, at some point it got around that if you could have a client who could make a studio money under any circumstances, the deal was even better. Enter, years ago, a novel by an English author -- can't remember his name off-hand -- whose novel was then republished in America by one of the major publishing houses. The novel was not as dull and dreary as its predecessor, so there was reason to be encouraged. Then they discovered that the author's ""agent"" (no signatures were ever produced) had negotiated a deal (in the back room with no other participants) whereby the author got 10% of all profits on any film version of his book.<br><br>The book did not do well in England; I don't know if it was published elsewhere or if it sold enough copies in this country to warrant an American publication. And even if so, no publishing house wanted to take on this story which would have cost them millions in advance advances to put out, because there just wasn't much of a chance that they would ever see any return from it.<br><br>So now studios are cautious about deals with ""novelists"" who, for one reason or another, do not get the kind of career-boosting recognition that might justify a big investment.<br><br>In the end, I think it comes down to the fact that a studio (or any business) must be regarded by its investors as being solvent and able to survive economically in order to attract investors. Investors don't want to risk their own money on a business that has very little chance of surviving.<br><br>And so we're left with nothing but musicals and superheroes!<br><br>Hardcastle, my sources are often on the record. But I can neither reveal them nor repeat what they said on the record. (I have enough trouble with my taxes as it is.)<br><br>But here's another off-the-record story -- I cannot give you all details because the contract is sealed.<br><br>Last year a well-known screenwriter and producer sold a book manuscript to a major publishing house. The contract was signed in the presence of both his agent and his manager. It was then forwarded to the production side of his agency, who took out part of it and forwarded it to a studio with whom they had a prior relationship with, at which time the studio then came back and made certain changes in it that were covered by their own talent deals lawyers. The writer's manager knew about these changes although not about their ramifications, but for some reason he never told his client about them, even after he saw another version of the contract which removed all references to this producer or project going to this particular studio, apparently because their planned production schedule conflicted with something else going on with them at that studio. So when he retired from management years later and those producers came back looking for him to help them find another agent for this movie, he told them he had no idea who the new agent was, and let them go to the then-present management agency for production deals.<br><br>The writer's former manager was never on the writer's pension plan (not because of the contract -- that would have been illegal -- but because of finances) and he died of cancer many years ago. The writer became a client of that agency in their production deals department, and it took them several years to even realize what he had been regarding as a ""live"" book project all that time. Then they went back to his old deal with the publishing house, realized it was still valid, even though it had never been activated by them (they didn't know about it), and sold the book for something like $400,000 to one of our major studios.<br><br>So now there is another film in production -- one more than I'm quite sick of seeing -- which at least has a chance of getting made now.

Suckers' choice!<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>19 PM By: Ron Hardcastle (Member)<br><br>Re: A NOTE FROM HARDCASTLE: BUT HE DREAMS ON!<br><br>For those of you who were at the Hollywood Bowl last night, I can report that James Newton Howard came out to a rousing ovation and played wonderfully with his band.<br><br>As always, I was especially mesmerized when he performed the big, brass-backed theme from ""The Fugitive."" I've watched that movie maybe a dozen times since it was first released in 1993, and like it better each time. But until seeing the live performance last night of those themes, I had never realized how similar in style they are to the main theme from ""Batman Returns."" It made me realize that Danny Elfman has been using a lot of the same musical tricks in both scores -- though they're very different in story.<br><br>And Howard's playing wasn't at all like Elfman's; there was nothing like his version of ""The Fugee"" (with most of the melody played by trombone) which is one of my favorite passages. And since Jack Nitzsche was also living when recording for this film, perhaps Howard also felt more freedom to play more jazz-influenced passages as well. (That's not",0
"When Natalie arrives at the address Trevor gave her, she quickly realizes that something isn't right and that Trevor might be a dangerous man .","to come up with a good story to fit this premise. When I read this premise I thought of many different ideas (one of which you can see above), but they didn't seem to fit into the story at all except as a subplot.<br><br>I personally didn't like how vague some parts were such as when Natalie was on her way to meet Trevor and she sees what looks like a murder scene outside their apartment complex (which is really a man dying from an allergic reaction). It's recent enough to still be suspicious and odd looking; however, there isn't much info provided by Natalie or explained by the writer on why this actually happening outside their apartment complex. This is important because it leads the reader to question why this happened so close to home, but we never get an answer to it (though talking with friends we came up with many ideas). Also I didn't like how difficult it would be to come up with a good story to fit this premise. When I read this premise I thought of many different ideas (one of which you can see above), but they didn't seem to fit into the story at all except as a subplot. ------------ Think about what sort of emotions you think your readers will get from reading your story and write them here:<br><br>I think that it will be a pleasant surprise for my readers to see Natalie go through this strange and mysterious adventure. It will also be funny at points, leaving my readers with a few chuckles.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>The next thing I did was write out the outline of what I, personally, thought that ""Tap Toes Doorstep"" is about and compare my notes with the analysis from Isaac. The results were very similar, but there were some differences; however, the main idea is still the same (Natalie and Trevor meet after Natalie posts an ad on Craigslist about wanting to date someone). But due to the fact that I'm going to be working in different mediums with this story (short film and graphic novels) and working at a much faster pace with writing it makes sense that there would be some major changes in how I write each individual medium. Here are the things that I came up with: ----------------------------- Let's start by looking at ""Tap Toes Doorstep"" as just a short film: Natalie arrives at her destination only to find out that she's been drugged before entering. When she finally regains consciousness she finds herself in Trevor's apartment against her will. Trevor takes Natalie into his apartment where he proceeds to rape her. Natalie manages to escape and finds a policeman. The policeman takes her back to Trevor's apartment where he then takes her to his office to interview her about what happened. During the interview, the officer confides in Natalie about his own personal life, revealing that he has a daughter who was killed by a drunk driver and that he doesn't blame himself for it because of his profession as a police officer (he should have been able to stop it from happening).<br><br>Outline: When Natalie arrives at her destination, she finds herself in an unfamiliar apartment and Trevor knocks out with sleeping pills. The next morning, she wakes up in Trevor's bedroom. Trevor explains that Natalie had agreed to come over for sex before she lost consciousness and that he was only trying to help her out by taking care of her while she was unconscious. However, Natalie leaves without saying anything else since she is uncomfortable with the situation and feels violated by him. She goes outside of his apartment complex only to realize that she is far away from home far way from where she is supposed to be and panics which results into calling the police anonymously on Trevor's phone. When the police arrive they arrest Trevor but when they see how distraught Natalie looks they decide not to put her through any further trouble, seeing as how she seems to be fine and that Trevor probably didn't mean to harm her.<br><br>Emotions: Because Natalie is a minor, she doesn't have the same rights as an adult does. She also doesn't know what to do about the situation and is left confused by all of it. Moreover, because of the events that have transpired, Natalie feels violated and frightened by Trevor and doesn't want anything else to do with him. She also feels ashamed of herself for getting mixed up with a man who is much older than her (she is 17 and he is in his mid-30's) and has no understanding of why she did it or how she let herself get into such a situation.<br><br>Theme: Being surrounded by drunk people or walking through a dark alleyway late at night can seem like harmless acts, but if you don't know where you are going or who you are with then it can lead to very dangerous situations. This is an important lesson for anyone of all ages because nobody wants to get hurt, but too often we aren't paying attention to our surroundings or we assume things about people that aren't true; this can lead us into dangerous situations from which we are unable to recover from. ----------------------------- Now let's look at ""Tap Toes Doorstep"" as it would look in the graphic novel form: Natalie meets Trevor at a bar and they start flirting with each other. Natalie finds out that Trevor is married but he sets her mind at ease by saying that he has no feelings for his wife, so they decide to go back to his apartment. When they arrive there, he reveals that he's actually a photographer who recently signed a contract with a magazine to do several photo shoots for them; one of the models had gotten sick and couldn't work so he needed someone to replace her. Natalie is excited about the idea and agrees to it immediately. She gets dressed up in clothes that Trevor brought for her and gets ready three different times before deciding which outfit she wanted to wear. Once she's ready, they head over to the photoshoot but when they arrive there, Natalie realizes that the photoshoot took place at an abandoned warehouse in an unlit parking lot. She tries taking off her clothes in order to get ready for her photo shoot but realizes she can't since she forgot where she put them; all of this makes Trevor upset and provoked him into trying to push her into having sex with him against her will.<br><br>Outline: Natalie meets Trevor at a bar while leaving work late one",0
Aimee Kincaid goes home after a long day at work only to find her apartment empty and her loneliness amplified by the silence.,"Aimee Kincaid came home to an empty apartment. She found the silence deafening. She felt alone, even though she had spent the day around people, listening to them talk and laugh and complain. She knew how it sounded when a person sat in solitude after a long trip. She would return from a long journey and sit on her bed and watch the light through the blinds or listen to her neighbor’s conversations with his wife on their balcony.<br><br>But she had never been home alone like this. Maybe that was why she felt so strange. So different, out of place. The solitude was new to her.<br><br>She went into the bathroom and turned on the shower and then, without really knowing why she wanted to, she moved through the apartment turning on all the lights. She turned them on in the kitchen, in her bedroom, even in the closet where nothing but old clothes were kept neatly folded. She  lit candles strategically placed around the room so that shadows could not obscure her vision or movement. She sat on her couch and listened to the silence, stared at the flickering lights, waiting for them to hypnotize her into a dreamy state of mind.<br><br>She was very tired but could not sleep. She stood up and found her way to the bedroom where she stripped off her clothes, put on a nightgown, and climbed into bed. She turned off all the lights except for the bedside lamp and lay there listening to the ticking of the wall clock and to the faint drone of cars passing on the street below. Silence was the only sound in the apartment now, and it was completely deafening.<br><br>Aimee felt a sudden sense of panic and fear. She had the feeling that someone was watching her, that someone or something was waiting for her to be completely vulnerable before striking out at her. She found herself looking around her apartment, trying to see something or someone who could be causing this feeling. But she found nothing there, only the light from the lamp moving gently against her walls and ceiling. Silence was all around her, and it seemed so absolute that she felt as if she were being smothered by its weight. Silence was all-encompassing. In her apartment.<br><br>Silence was all-encompassing in her own small corner of the world, and it was suffocating to her. Silence pressed in on her from all sides, making it hard for her to breathe, and she felt suddenly overwhelmed by it.  She started to cry.<br><br>She cried because the silence was terrifying. She cried because it was so loud, so overwhelming. She cried because she felt alone in a way that no one should have to feel alone, her own small safe island surrounded by an ocean of noise and voices that had suddenly turned into nothing more than a silent and lonely roaring emptiness.<br><br>She felt exhausted and drained, drained of all the energy it took to simply get through her day. She felt lonely, unable to see past the walls that surrounded her, unable to even reach out for something solid with which she could hold on. She felt defeated by the  silence around her because she knew that it would never be silent again, at least not for a very long time.<br><br>She cried because there was no one in her apartment, there was no where else to go, there was nothing else to do but cry and wonder why the hell she had ever come back in the first place.

Natalie goes to the police and helps them apprehend Trevor Lockwood before he can hurt anyone else .,"interacting at once, some of them will have to be turned into background characters. The outline is for this very reason; it eliminates the need to include everything in your story which is not necessary by just making a note of what you want to show in each scene and with these notes, you can draw up a better idea of how everything will look overall.<br><br>If done correctly, an outline is an extremely useful guide; it enables you to fill out missing scenes and details as well as eliminate any parts that don't fit your story and do not need to be told in detail. It's also something that helps you keep track of all of the information without having to worry about whether or not the notes are accurate if they aren't completely filled out; if there's a part that doesn't have a description or name for something when the outline is finished, then it means there's something missing or that this particular element isn't needed at all. The goal here is to create something flexible so that it can still be followed if someone decides to change things around during writing/drawing/animating; if this is achieved properly, your outline will be much more effective and easier to work with overall. However, sometimes things can change as well and sometimes even though you've followed your outline to the letter, you can find yourself changing things later on down the line for your own reasons.<br><br>Perspective is Everything<br><br>One of the most important things you need to focus on when creating an outline is who you're writing it from. Are you writing it in first person or third person? Are you writing it in past tense or present tense? The perspective has a huge impact on how your story will end up looking; which one are you going to use and why? This is something that requires a bit of thought and time because not only do they affect what kind of story you tell, they also affect the way your characters interact with one another as well as how they act. Before I even consider who I will write my stories from or what kind of tense my stories will be written in, I decide if I want them to be created from first person or third person perspective and then I work with that decision from there; if I decide to use first person, then the story will be told by me for lack of a better word because the narration comes directly from my character. Writing first person usually makes for an interesting perspective change but it also has its own problems; for example: What if my character talks about how she thinks her life sucks? Does that make me look bad as an author? If your character is a girl who has to deal with having an abusive boyfriend, even if she doesn't condone it, will other people automatically assume that you're trying to say that domestic abuse is okay? These are all things you need to take into consideration when writing in first person.<br><br>On the other hand, writing in third person perspective is a bit more forgiving and (in my opinion) a lot easier to work with; it doesn't directly show what's happening inside my characters' minds but it does show everything else through the use of body language and facial expression. In this case, I can write about how my characters are feeling without needing to actually say anything about it; for instance: When something bad happens between Natalie and Trevor and Natalie's friends ask her what happened, she can just look away from them without saying anything at all. Third person perspective also seems more logical since there's the whole idea of being able to tell what your characters are thinking without them actually having to narrate their thoughts for you. It sounds strange but it's a lot easier than having first person narration where I have to write as if I'm talking directly to the reader or having limited narrations which basically means only having your characters think about things I have no way of knowing or writing my stories in a ""voice"" that doesn't really seem like anything.<br><br>Of course, there are other options as well such as writing a story from the perspective of an outside narrator or having parts where you focus on the life of your characters and then go back to the beginning and start over with a different point of view. Both methods work well but I find that it is better to stick with one perspective and follow it through until the end. If you're going to use first person, then make sure every part of your outline is in first person; if you switch midway through, then chances are you might end up confusing yourself and worse case scenario, you won't be able to determine whether or not you're making sense anymore.<br><br>Something else to keep in mind is asking yourself what kind of tone you want for your story; this includes deciding if your characters should be sarcastic while they're talking (if they are, are they talking that way because they're frustrated?) or if they should simply be more serious than usual (if so, how would their tone change if something bad happened?). This applies especially when working with comedy because the characters' tones will play a huge part in how their jokes are presented and whether or not they should actually be funny or if it's better to leave them serious.<br><br>----------------------<br><br>? Choosing the right POV can make or break a story and you don't want to find out that it's the latter on your own. So make sure to take the time to think about what kind of perspective you want before you get started on your outline. After all, writing is a lot like cooking: You can't expect anything good to come out of it if you don't put in the right ingredients.<br><br>? Next time, we'll go over how to create a character (and even how to select which one of them will be the main ""star"" of your story). Until then!<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>? You may have noticed that I used several phrases in this chapter that I didn't explain such as: ""First person perspectives"" or ""third person perspectives."" While these are relatively simple terms, I didn't define them because this would change what I'm trying to preach here: Think before you act because while planning may seem like an unnecessary step, it is actually something that truly changes everything. It makes what you're doing feel more natural and it will help you",0
"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","<br><br>Jenna woke up groggily and looked around her dim surroundings. Her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, but not enough to recognize where she was. Plus, she was still a little out of it from whatever drug her attacker had given her. As Jenna's mind raced, looking for answers, the memories of that day began to flood back into her mind.<br><br>***<br><br>Jenna Riley walked down the street to the local diner where she worked as a waitress. She worked nights for most of the week, and it was especially lonely on those nights when she came home late at night and there was nobody there to greet her except for her cat, Oliver. Even though she didn't really need a job anymore, Jenna found comfort in having something productive to do every night after coming home after being out on the streets all day being an independent woman and living in a city like New York all by herself.<br><br>As Jenna walked down the darkened street, she felt a little uneasy about being alone at that hour of night when most sensible people were already tucked snugly into bed at home with their families or significant others. There weren't many people walking around the street either; they were probably all inside too scared to be out at that hour of the night. She finally arrived at the diner and went inside to find her boss and friend, Shirley, standing behind the counter with a worried look on her face.<br><br>""Jenna,"" Shirley said. ""I'm so glad you're here.""<br><br>""Why?"" Jenna asked. ""Is there something wrong with Oliver or something? Did he get out of his cage again?""<br><br>""No, nothing like that,"" Shirley said reassuringly. ""I'm just really happy to see you. I'm the only one here right now, so we can watch each other's backs if anybody comes in or anything.""<br><br>A shiver of fear ran through Jenna's body as a burst of dark energy swept through her mind from nowhere. She tried to shake it off and focus on something else, but she couldn't help but wonder if there was somebody out there watching her that night, just waiting for their moment to strike. As Jenna tried to shake off that thought, she poured two cups of coffee for herself and Shirley and took them over to them at the counter before sitting down with one beside her on the countertop.<br><br>""You know what?"" Jenna said cheerfully as she took a sip of her coffee. ""We should just have a little party here tonight! We can bring in some of your other friends too and we can all celebrate having a great night so far!""<br><br>Shirley shook her head sadly. ""I don't think I can do that.""<br><br>""Why not?"" Jenna asked. ""It'll just be a little fun for us to have, especially with this feeling I'm getting that somebody's watching us right now.""<br><br>Shirley took a long sip of her coffee and sighed. Finally she said, ""Let's don't talk about it anymore because it's going to ruin our night. Let's just focus on some good tunes and celebrate life with each other, okay?""<br><br>Jenna put the cup down on the counter with a sigh and nodded, but she couldn't help thinking to herself that something bad was going to happen at any moment because it felt like there were two different worlds swirling around them at that moment: one world where they were having their little party and the other where danger was lurking in the shadows of the dark street outside.<br><br>Just as Jenna finished pouring another cup of coffee for herself, she heard a loud crash from outside in the street. She turned her head towards the door to see if someone was stumbling into the diner, but there was nobody there. She decided that it couldn't be anything to worry about and she turned her attention back to Shirley so she could continue talking about music or something like that, but then another loud crash echoed through the street.<br><br>""What on earth is going on out there?"" Shirley said anxiously as she stood up from her seat at the counter and walked over to the door and peered outside.<br><br>Suddenly, a man burst into the diner with a wild look in his eyes and he pointed a sword at them with a growling voice. ""Nobody move!""<br><br>Jenna fell off of her chair in surprise as the guy lunged towards them with his sword drawn out. She quickly got back up onto her feet just as he sliced through Shirley's neck, cutting her throat so deeply that blood sprayed all over Jenna's face and shirt as Shirley collapsed in a heap at their feet. Jenna was too shocked to speak or act at first, but then when she saw blood all over herself, it snapped her out of it enough to scream loudly.<br><br>The man quickly covered Jenna's mouth with his hand and held the sword close to her neck as he walked around behind them. As he waved it around in the air, he said, ""I don't want to kill you! Just stop screaming and do what I say and you'll be fine. Got it?""<br><br>Eventually Jenna nodded her head after a few seconds and then he took his hand off of her mouth. ""Now,"" he said as he walked towards the counter, ""what's your name?""<br><br>""Jenna Riley,"" Jenna said as she wiped blood out of her eyes.<br><br>The man nodded as he picked up the phone with his free hand. ""Good, now call your boyfriend and tell him to meet us at that abandoned amusement park down by the river.""<br><br>Jenna sighed quietly before reaching into her pocket and pulling out her cell phone. She wouldn't even know what to say to Matthias at that moment because she was still in shock from seeing the man slash Shirley's neck like that. It seemed like an eternity until she was finally able to press call on Matthias' contact information and put it up to her ear before saying, ""Matthias? Um...it's me.""<br><br>In the background on the other end of the line there was some music playing loudly in a bar or something like that because",0
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"friends, and she had stopped taking part in the activities she used to enjoy doing in her spare time. Shannon was spending more time alone at home because her father didn’t seem interested in doing anything with her, and so it seemed as though she had no one else to turn to but herself. “She’s trying to cope with her loss, and I don’t think she’s learned to do that yet,” Uncle Jeff said.<br><br>Shannon was sitting on the edge of her bed, holding a box of oil paints that was given to her by her mother before she passed away from cancer. She started crying uncontrollably once again upon seeing both her uncle and father approach her room slowly. “What are you doing here?” Shannon asked, wiping the tears from her face and standing up. There were paint stains on her cheeks, nose and hands. Her uncle could see that she had been crying for a while.<br><br>“I came to talk to you,” her father said.<br><br>“About what?” Shannon asked, turning away from them. She started pacing around the room as she spoke. “You don’t care how I feel, so why should I tell you?” she asked.<br><br>Her father stepped inside the room and placed a hand on her shoulder. “I do care about how you feel daughter,” he said softly. Her uncle noticed that there were small tears forming in her father’s eyes.<br><br>“Yeah, right. If you did care, you wouldn’t have left us all behind to deal with this grief on our own,” she said, turning to face her father directly now. She looked in his eyes and saw that he had started crying now. “He doesn’t care.” She turned to face her uncle now. “You don’t care either, do you?”<br><br>Her uncle sighed and shook his head slowly. He did care, but he knew that she wouldn’t believe him just yet. “No, I do care Shannon,” he said gently.<br><br>She looked at him for a few moments while the tears continued to fall from her father’s eyes and then nodded and walked over to sit on her bed. The two men stood nearby, unsure of what to do next. Her father was crying now,  so he didn’t know how to handle this situation.<br><br>Shannon saw the box of oil paints on her nightstand. She picked it up and opened it slowly, letting the tears continue to stream down her face as she did so. She stared at the empty canvas in front of her for a few moments before she took out a large brush and dipped it into a small jar of red paint. Then, Shannon started to paint.<br><br>She started painting out of her own grief and loneliness, but as she worked, she found that somehow painting helped to ease it. She painted for hours and didn’t eat anything. Shannon’s need to paint became so strong that she decided to clear out her attic and turn it into a studio, so that she could paint there whenever she felt like it.<br><br>She turned her old wooden desk into a workbench and filled the walls with canvases, paints, brushes, and other painting materials. Shannon moved her easel to the center of the room and placed two chairs in front of it. She hung some potted plants in the corners of the room for decoration purposes. The attic was small, but she didn’t mind that. It was just right for her. It also reminded  her of the attic in the family’s old barn.<br><br>Shannon would spend hours in the studio, painting and listening to music on her headphones. She discovered that drawing people helped her to feel connected with her mother once more, and so she would draw portraits of her mother over and over again. The  act of drawing also helped Shannon to cope with her feelings.<br><br>Shannon started to put her own feelings into the paintings, too. She could often be found staring at one of her own unfinished paintings, which had two figures standing in a meadow. The figures were very dark and pale, reflecting Shannon’s feelings of being filled with darkness but also feeling a glimmer of light at the same time.<br><br>This painting became an outlet for Shannon and she would often sit and stare at it for long periods of time to try to work some of her pain and confusion out on it. Sometimes, she would cover the painted surface with salt and trace the outlines of her paintings in a faint blue wash. This felt like she was connecting with someone, especially since her own mother could no longer speak to her. Shannon felt as if she were having a conversation with her mother by painting the images over and over again. Shannon started to feel closer to her paintings and knew that they helped her to heal.<br><br>Shannon painted for hours every day, with only a short break for lunch which she always ate while standing up. She drank a lot of water so that she wouldn’t feel weak or tired. She felt almost as peaceful as when she was painting and felt that it was her therapy. Shannon painted every night until she finished a painting, and then she would start a new one. Sometimes, she would paint for six hours straight without stopping, and this helped to ease the pain in her heart. Sometimes, while painting, Shannon felt like",1
Julia finally learns the truth about the visions.,"and a bright green light begins to envelope me and everything around me to the point that I can barely see…and when the light finally dies down and I open my eyes again, I find myself standing in an all white room with two large angels standing at a doorway that looks sort of like a portal...<br><br>""She's already gone...""

Trevor Lockwood ends up being a serial killer who lures women to their death and Natalie narrowly escapes becoming his next victim .,"to realize that she had been played. Trevor had lured her out to his home under false pretenses with the hopes that she would sleep with him. Natalie figured that he might have been trying to rape her, since she was stuck out in the middle of nowhere with no means of escape and a man who wanted to hurt her.<br><br>After a few weeks, Natalie moved to a city close by. She never told anyone about what Trevor Lockwood had done to her, not even her closest friends. She was ashamed of what had happened to her and she thought people would think less of her if they knew that she had slept with a man in order to get money. She had played Trevor Lockwood and now she felt like he was playing her, this time by trying to lure her into his home where he could kill her.<br><br>Natalie Harper’s home was a modest one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of a city. She had moved to the city so that she could get a job at a grocery store closer to her home.<br><br>She moved in with some friends from her hometown, but three months later she found herself living alone again due to disagreements over money and rent with her roommates. She had found the apartment after being referred there by  the manager at a local grocery store where she worked.<br><br>Natalie had been working as a cashier at the grocery store for about two months when she ran into Trevor Lockwood again, who wanted to set up another meeting with her. Natalie declined. Trevor persisted, sending Natalie emails that were rude and pushy.<br><br>Eventually Natalie changed her mind, realizing that she needed the money to pay her bills. Trevor Lockwood had offered her a job working as a model for his modeling agency. She was reluctant at first but decided to give it a try because it paid well and she would be able to quit her job at the grocery store, which Natalie realized that she didn’t care much for.<br><br>Natalie agreed to meet Trevor Lockwood at a local restaurant and discuss the offer in person.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was a handsome young man with bright eyes and short dark hair. He was about twenty-seven years old Natalie guessed, though she couldn’t be sure. Trevor Lockwood had a confident air about him. He was very persuasive and knew how to work people, Natalie observed. And he seemed like he could be dangerous if provoked, she thought. He definitely wasn’t someone she wanted to cross. But  the money sounded too good to pass up.<br><br>When Natalie arrived at the restaurant, Trevor Lockwood was already sitting at a table, alone. He greeted her with a smile and some small talk about the weather. It was unusually cold and snowing outside for this time of year. Natalie pulled aside her coat to  reveal a tight black dress underneath. The dress was mostly sheer and showed off Natalie’s ample cleavage.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood smiled appreciatively, his eyes taking in every inch of Natalie’s body, lingering on her breasts. After glancing down at her cleavage a few more times Natalie finally pulled the coat back over her chest and pretended to be interested in a news article she had retrieved from the check-stand rack. Trevor Lockwood’s eyes kept darting back to Natalie’s chest, his face flushed with arousal.<br><br>Natalie looked up at Trevor Lockwood and smiled coyly, knowing that she was getting to him. Trevor Lockwood responded by scooting closer to her on the bench seat of his booth. Natalie moved back slightly so that their knees weren’t touching and waited for Trevor Lockwood to continue.<br><br>After some more small talk about Natalie struggling to make rent",1
"With supplies running low and tensions high, the group must work together to find a way out before it's too late.","was at the table. Jennifer leaned against the wall next to the door and waited. It had been several hours and it was finally dark outside, which meant it would be safer for her to go out. She checked her compass one more time before heading out into the forest.<br><br>Jennifer moved quickly through the woods towards the stream. The trees were thick here, and it was easy to get lost in them. Without any landmarks, she couldn’t tell whether or not she was going the right way.<br><br>She reached down and pulled her shirt up over her nose to block out the smell of mildew that still lingered in the air. Jennifer moved as quickly as she could, but it was slow going in the dark.<br><br>The last thing she needed was to run into another group of survivors and have to fight them for what little they had now. It would be better if she found the stream on her own and moved in that direction. It wasn’t likely that there would be another house nearby, but it was possible.<br><br>Jennifer moved silently through the trees, moving slowly and carefully so as not to make any sound. She was walking through a small clearing when she heard something move behind her. She moved faster, but it was too late.<br><br>The group moved to the house. Jennifer had already been there and knew how to get in, so she let the others go first. They moved quietly through the woods until they reached a small clearing where they could see the stream and an old house. The house was about three hundred yards away, but it was dark out and there were trees everywhere, so it was hard to tell exactly how far away it was.<br><br>Moving closer to the house, she moved quickly around the side of the house so that she could check for signs of life. She came around the house to find a small building in the back left corner. Walking towards it, Jennifer moved slowly so as not to attract any attention from anyone who might be inside. She moved up and peeked into the window, only to see a dim light.<br><br>Moving slowly up to the door, Jennifer carefully tried opening it, moving slowly at first then using more force after a moment. The door creaked open just enough for her to slip through the crack. Moving slowly into the house, she saw that it was made of some kind of metal and glass. There was a large table in the middle of the room with chairs surrounding it.  She could not tell if anyone was inside, but there were some supplies on the table that she wanted to look at.<br><br>She moved over to the table and put her backpack on the ground, then opened it so she could take out her flashlight. She moved the light around until she found a bottle of bleach,  three packs of beef jerky with 12 pieces in each pack, and a small bag of Doritos. The food would not last for the entire group for very long, but it would give them something to eat for the next couple of days.<br><br>Moving back to the door, she tried pushing on it but it would not budge. She tapped the door several times, hoping someone was inside who could help her get out. After several more minutes of no response, she decided that they must have gone out through another door in the house. Putting her backpack on again, she headed to the other side of the house to find  another exit.<br><br>She walked down the hallway and turned a corner, but saw that it was blocked by debris that had fallen from a hole in the ceiling. She moved around the pile of bricks and wood until she found a door with a handle. The door opened, but instead of another hallway she was looking at several piles of rubble that had collapsed onto themselves.<br><br>Stephanie climbed over them and continued her way down the hall when she heard someone coming down the stairs behind her. She turned and prepared to run, but instead of another hostile group she saw a man carrying two cases of bottled water. He was tall, skinny, and muscular with black hair, brown eyes, and multiple tattoos on his arms.<br><br>The group had gathered all the supplies they could carry from the house and were preparing to leave when a man ran into the house. He carried two cases of bottled water in his arms and began passing them out to everyone.",1
Kyle comforts Aimee and the two share a heart-to-heart conversation that leaves Aimee feeling understood for the first time.,"<br><br>Kyle looked at her with pity in his eyes, not judging her for acting childishly. “You know, Aimee, I think everyone feels that way at times. You aren’t the only one who gets nervous when you’re alone in a room full of strangers or if your family is acting a little distant. It’s okay to feel lonely sometimes, and it makes perfect sense that you do since you are alone so much. But it doesn’t mean you don’t have friends, that you don’t have people who care about you. It just means that  you’re a little nervous by yourself, that’s all. Being alone can be scary for anyone! That’s normal.”<br><br>Aimee nodded in agreement, not saying anything right away and sort of smiling at the fact that Kyle hadn’t made fun of her or told her she was acting like a wimp. She wasn’t sure if she believed him or not, but it was nice to hear that someone else understood what she felt and didn’t act like she needed to suck it up or something.<br><br>“I know how much I want to be with other people when I feel lonely too, Aimee. It’s a natural human emotion! I know that whenever I’m having a tough time with something, I just want to crawl into bed and not come out until the next morning when everyone is gone. But those feelings will pass. And then I’ll feel better and glad that I didn’t do what I initially wanted to do, which was just wallow in my own self-pity.”<br><br>Aimee furrowed her brows at Kyle. “I never want to be around other people when I’m lonely,” she said. “I just want to be alone. But it doesn’t always help even if I do that, especially if it’s late at night and there’s no one else around to talk to or anything. When I’m lonely, there’s nothing that anyone else can do. The only thing that would make me feel better is to be with a guy who actually understands what I’m going through and wants to be around me. But you don’t see a lot of guys like that, do you?” She shook her head.<br><br>“It’s not easy to find guys who are as understanding as you are, either,” she said. “I wish there were more girls out there like you and Jessica. Guys like David are so rare in this world. I mean, who would think that someone like him would be friends with me?” She smiled sadly at her own words.<br><br>Kyle gazed at Aimee for a few seconds, then shrugged and said with a casual smile, “You’ve got to have something to balance out my craziness. Even though I can be a little  too intense sometimes, I’m sensitive to other people’s needs. And if being understanding is wrong, I don’t want to be right.”<br><br>Aimee smiled at him then nodded, as if giving him an answer. She felt completely relaxed and comfortable around Kyle. That hadn’t happened to her in a while, not to this extent.<br><br>He yawned and Aimee couldn’t help but smile. She yawned too as they got up and headed towards her room. Kyle said goodnight to her parents, who were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV, and Aimee said goodbye to him shortly after. She waved goodbye to him from the door and then turned around and looked at her bedroom.<br><br>Kyle had made her bedroom seem a lot cozier with his presence, she thought to herself. He had also made her feel less alone, a feeling that Aimee wasn’t used to.<br><br>She shut the door behind her and said goodbye one last time to Kyle through the window. She then closed all the blinds and locked her door, went over to her bed, lay down on it and turned off the light. She couldn’t remember the last time she had said goodbye to anybody and felt so…<br><br>Aimee sighed. She didn’t know how to describe the feeling.<br><br>It was a feeling of sadness, yet also a feeling of comfort, a feeling or warmth and hope for the future, she thought to herself. She thought Kyle had said goodbye to her before, but it didn’t seem as real as this did, like Aimee had just said goodbye to someone who she knew could be trusted with her secrets and who would still be there for her when she needed him. <br><br>It was a feeling that Aimee had only felt once before, she thought to herself.<br><br>Aimee got up off of her bed and went over to her bookcase, opened one of the drawers at the bottom of it and started putting away her books.<br><br>She was feeling less and less like sleeping, but she knew that she had a long day ahead of her tomorrow at work, so she turned off the light, closed her eyes and tried to sleep.<br><br>But sleep wouldn’t come. It never did anymore these days, but Aimee rarely ever complained about it, because she knew that there were people who had it worse than her.",1

And then I’ll feel better and glad that I didn’t do what I initially wanted to do, which was just wallow in my own self-pity.”<br><br>Aimee furrowed her brows at Kyle. “I never want to be around other people when I’m lonely,” she said. “I just want to be alone. But it doesn’t always help even if I do that, especially if it’s late at night and there’s no one else around to talk to or anything. When I’m lonely, there’s nothing that anyone else can do. The only thing that would make me feel better is to be with a guy who actually understands what I’m going through and wants to be around me. But you don’t see a lot of guys like that, do you?” She shook her head.<br><br>“It’s not easy to find guys who are as understanding as you are, either,” she said. “I wish there were more girls out there like you and Jessica. Guys like David are so rare in this world. I mean, who would think that someone like him would be friends with me?” She smiled sadly at her own words.<br><br>Kyle gazed at Aimee for a few seconds, then shrugged and said with a casual smile, “You’ve got to have something to balance out my craziness. Even though I can be a little  too intense sometimes, I’m sensitive to other people’s needs. And if being understanding is wrong, I don’t want to be right.”<br><br>Aimee smiled at him then nodded, as if giving him an answer. She felt completely relaxed and comfortable around Kyle. That hadn’t happened to her in a while, not to this extent.<br><br>He yawned and Aimee couldn’t help but smile. She yawned too as they got up and headed towards her room. Kyle said goodnight to her parents, who were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV, and Aimee said goodbye to him shortly after. She waved goodbye to him from the door and then turned around and looked at her bedroom.<br><br>Kyle had made her bedroom seem a lot cozier with his presence, she thought to herself. He had also made her feel less alone, a feeling that Aimee wasn’t used to.<br><br>She shut the door behind her and said goodbye one last time to Kyle through the window. She then closed all the blinds and locked her door, went over to her bed, lay down on it and turned off the light. She couldn’t remember the last time she had said goodbye to anybody and felt so…<br><br>Aimee sighed. She didn’t know how to describe the feeling.<br><br>It was a feeling of sadness, yet also a feeling of comfort, a feeling or warmth and hope for the future, she thought to herself. She thought Kyle had said goodbye to her before, but it didn’t seem as real as this did, like Aimee had just said goodbye to someone who she knew could be trusted with her secrets and who would still be there for her when she needed him. <br><br>It was a feeling that Aimee had only felt once before, she thought to herself.<br><br>Aimee got up off of her bed and went over to her bookcase, opened one of the drawers at the bottom of it and started putting away her books.<br><br>She was feeling less and less like sleeping, but she knew that she had a long day ahead of her tomorrow at work, so she turned off the light, closed her eyes and tried to sleep.<br><br>But sleep wouldn’t come. It never did anymore these days, but Aimee rarely ever complained about it, because she knew that there were people who had it worse than her.",1
Daisy Mayberry receives a diagnosis of cancer and her family and friends come together to support her.,"<br><br>Daisy got worse over the weekend and her family didn’t know what to do. They were all standing around her bedside, looking helpless. She was the youngest of six children and had just gotten married two months ago. The bride was now a stricken woman about to lose everything she knew for over seven years. Daisy lost her husband a week before he was due to come back from his tour in Iraq, after not seeing each other for nearly twelve months.<br><br>Her mother sat on a chair in the corner holding her hand. Her father stood with his head down wiping his eyes with his sleeves; his oldest son stood next to him crying silently while leaning on his father’s shoulder. The rest of Daisy’s family members stood around them crying silently too.<br><br>Daisy started thrashing around in pain and they decided that they needed to act fast or it would be too late; they needed to find someone who could help them before their daughter slipped away forever, and right now it looked like there wasn’t much of a chance that would happen anytime soon; she wouldn’t last more than five minutes if this pain did not stop soon, not without something helping her quickly, which meant that they had to find someone who could help her as soon as possible.<br><br>Her mother grabbed the phone and called 9876, which is what people usually did when they were in such dire need of help, especially since no one knew anyone who could help them with this kind of problem. She dialed the number and waited, “Hello, I need to speak to someone who can help me with a dying friend or relative” she said into the receiver.<br><br>The operator on the other end of the line asked her a few questions and then told her that because it was critical they would call back in a few minutes. A few minutes later she received a phone call back from one of their operators who was going to send someone as soon as possible to help them.<br><br>Daisy was thrashing around trying to get away from the pain she was experiencing at that moment; she couldn’t understand why everyone else didn’t feel the pain she felt; after all it wasn’t just a little pain anymore, people never warned her that it would turn out like this. She would have gone on living normal if not for this plague! Why had no one warned her what it would be like? Now everyone around her looked on as if she was just crying, but it was the pain she felt that made her cry; it was horrible and no one could fix this.<br><br>Her mother looked up at the clock, praying that someone would come soon, her daughter needed help and she couldn’t take this anymore; she cried for this innocent girl who had never done anything to anyone and now because of one stupid decision had to go through something like this. It may have been her time to go but why couldn’t her time have been a few years from now? Why now? Why at nineteen years old with so much ahead of her? She could be more than what everyone thought she would be if only they had more time.<br><br>The doorbell rang and everyone looked at each other as if they were saying “now what?” Daisy’s father walked over to the door and opened it, “I’m here for the dying girl, you told us on the phone that you need our help. Is the girl still in agony? We don’t have much time; are you ready for us to get started or do we need to wait a bit longer until you think it is okay for us to start working? Have your family members chosen anyone in the room they want to be separated from and will they be okay with being put in a separate room or do they want to stay together?” said the man standing at their front door.<br><br>“We don’t want you to touch our daughter, we want you to let her go peacefully, can you just do that for us? I know it may not be how you normally handle things but that is what we want. We don’t care about anything else; all we care about is making sure that my daughter dies peacefully without any pain. Is there anything we can do for your service first? Money? Whatever it is we are willing to pay for it. We need this over with as soon as possible; my daughter has no idea what is happening to her so if it has nothing to do with pain then we are willing to allow it. If you have a way that she can die slowly and peacefully while not feeling any pain then please help her, she may not deserve this but she doesn’t deserve the torture she is going through either and there isn’t anyone who can help me make this better. Just give me some time alone with her until someone comes back, or make whatever deal you want with me; I’ll sign anything, just get this over with, but please no more pain for my Daisy,” she repeated.<br><br>The man looked at her and then looked at her daughter, “can you tell me why you are willing to pay any amount of money to have this thing go differently? None of us know your daughter or why she is the way she is but the way you spoke about her makes me think that she didn’t deserve this. Maybe there is something I can do for her; maybe our service really will make a difference. We will do what you request; we won’t touch your daughter at all, we will have someone come in to help your family stand guard while those who want to go make their final goodbyes. We will also send someone out to your house very soon so that they can take care of the arrangements that need to be made. I apologize if our actions seem abrupt or rude but we don’t encounter situations like this often so we don’t know how to do what you are asking, but we will try our best not to make it worse or cause more trouble than it already is.” He paused and looked at Daisy Mayberrys",0

So I picked it up off the side table, blew off the dust that had accumulated on it, and went upstairs.<br><br>			I opened my bedroom door and walked inside. Before I could even turn around all the way, I stopped cold in my tracks when I heard the sound of a loud gasp then the unmistakable sound of someone vomiting.<br><br>			""What are you doing here?"" I demanded as I turned around to confront the interloper in my room. I was stunned when I saw who it was that had broken into my house.<br><br>			""Dawnie!"" Nate said from the edge of my bed where he sat leaning over a wastebasket with his head resting on his arms as he continued to heave up his guts into it. He looked like hell with dark circles under his eyes, sunken cheeks, and greyish skin that made me think he had been sweating bucket loads and not bathing very often since we last talked. He raised his head up as if to see me better, but didn't appear to be able to focus on anything for more than a split second before he put his head back down on his arms again and continued heaving up whatever was left in him. The vomit smelled bitter and somehow familiar, which made me wonder if he had been drinking.<br><br>			""What on earth were you thinking Nate? You can't just break into a person's house and take over like that. This is my house and I don't want anyone..."" I was at a loss for words, my anger flared up, but then quickly subsided when he told me why he broke into my house.<br><br>			""I have nowhere else to go,"" Nate said weakly as he slowly raised his head up again to face me. His eyes glazed over and unfocused as he tried to look at me as if seeing me for the first time. ""There are Takers outside,"" Nate said in a voice so cold and lifeless that it shocked me to hear such an emotional sound coming out of him at all because it was something I had never heard before, not even in the most miserable or frightened of moments. It occurred to me this was probably the most frightened he had ever been in his life because of the Takers. ""They found us,"" Nate said after another moment passed with him staring off into space not really focusing on anything which made me think he wasn't really talking to me at all anymore which made PTSD sound about right for this situation because nothing about this situation seemed normal for Nate or anything else.<br><br>			""What do you mean Takers? What have they done to you?"" I asked as I moved over to him and knelt down in front of him. He was still sitting there with his head in his arms, leaning forward, and shivering as if he had just been outside in the cold for a long time. ""Are you okay Nate? Are you sick?"" I reached out with my hand and touched him on the shoulder. He looked up at me from his position on the bed and after a moment of being totally still while I looked into his eyes, he started sobbing uncontrollably again which made me realize he must not be okay after all because he had never shown any outward signs of emotion before like this so it wasn't like me to see him crying or shaking like this now. It was really freaking me out because I didn't want to think that Nate would ever allow a Taker anywhere near him or anyone else either because the one thing everyone knew about Nate was that he had never been afraid of anything in all his life which was why everyone thought so highly of him despite whatever their own personal problem or internal demons might be that kept them from facing their fears or taking chances before and for some people maybe even afterwards too.<br><br>			""It's the Takers."" Nate whispered in a voice so low it was barely a whisper at all. ""The Takers are coming!"" he yelled with his voice breaking when he said, ""they found us."" I watched as Nate buried his face in my bed sheets and continued to shake like crazy as tears streamed down his cheeks and he started sobbing again for what seemed like an eternity. He then said, ""They're going to kill me..."" with a quivering voice that made me start sobbing too for a couple minutes before I composed myself enough to try and talk to him again, but he wouldn't answer me until I touched him on the shoulder again. As soon as I did, he looked up at me with his eyes filled with tears and even more fear than they were before. Nate had never been afraid of anything in his entire life which made this look truly terrifying to see on this normally tough guy as if what ever happened between now and then had completely broken him and turned him into someone else entirely which made me wonder if I was even still talking to the same person anymore or not because it seemed that something had seriously changed inside of him while he was out there somehow or maybe it was something to do with this change that <br><br>The world ended in a cataclysmic event.<br><br>In the aftermath of the cataclysm, the survivors searched for an explanation.

Mary Smith walks home from work and becomes the victim of a mugging attempt by John Doe.,"The alley was dark. It was a short walk from the corner where Mary Smith had been walking, but she still didn’t trust it. Mary fidgeted the whole way, watching all around her for anyone who might be lurking in the shadows. She didn’t like this alley; it was dark and dusty and full of trash.<br><br>She crossed over to the other side, trying to get farther away from the alley’s entrance, but a group of teens were standing there smoking pot. They looked at her with smirks on their faces – they knew what Mary was doing and were probably laughing at her behind her back. One of them leaned over and grabbed Mary by the shoulders, demanding that she hand over whatever she had in her pockets.<br><br>Mary Smith stood rooted to the spot, unable to move as John Doe pushed into her personal space. He demanded that she empty her pockets right then and Mary Smith panicked. She dug for her purse in her bag, hoping that inside were some items of value that she could give him. Instead, she only came up with some receipts and a few coins. She hoped those would suffice, but John Doe demanded more.  He got angry when she told him that this was all she had.<br><br>“You were just at the corner shop!” he screamed at her. “Didn’t you just buy something?”<br><br>Mary Smith wanted to cry. When John Doe realized that Mary Smith wasn’t going to give him more money, he moved in closer to her. Then she noticed the gun in his hand and she began to tremble.<br><br>“If you don’t give me everything, I’ll kill you,” he threatened. <br><br>Mary Smith reached into her bag again, hoping there was something else she could find to appease him. She felt around in her purse and eventually, her hand connected with the contents of her wallet — which John Doe was now demanding she hand over. Mary Smith did as John Doe told her and handed him the contents of her wallet.<br><br>He demanded more money, but at this point, Mary Smith only had change. John Doe began to look through her wallet in search of more cash but what he found was a photograph. He stared at it for a moment and then turned toward Mary Smith once again. <br><br>“Give me your phone,” he demanded. “I know you have one.”<br><br>Mary Smith suddenly realized that she had been so caught up in not giving him any more money that she hadn’t even considered the possibility that John Doe might want to take her phone. John Doe became angry when he found no other valuables in Mary Smith’s pocket; he told her to turn over the contents of her purse and to empty her pockets, but she had already removed everything that she thought he could possibly want.<br><br>She searched through her bag again but all that was inside was her purse, a few receipts, and a pack of gum — none of which John Doe apparently wanted.<br><br>Mary Smith began to feel hopeless. Surely there was nothing left of her belongings that could be of any value to John Doe. She started to become angry herself — how dare John Doe demand more from her",1
"John Doe, the serial killer, tells Valerie that she must escape the basement before dawn or else she will become his next trophy.","became aware, then, that there was something sticky on her mouth, and a gag holding it shut from behind. She moved a hand to grab it with both hands, trying to pull it off… and found that it would not budge. She tugged at it furiously for a few moments, until she felt exhaustion setting in. The high-pitched whine of frustration died away into despairing silence as the last bit of energy left her body.All she could do now was wait and wonder what this place was; to fear what might happen next. What had happened before? The memories came back reluctantly -- a black car, the attacker's close-cropped hair, his piercing eyes as he stared at her, his hand reaching for something in his pocket…A part of her brain registered an odd smell. It was faint, but it was definitely present. The smell of decay…-----------------------------You can try the full version of this game by clicking here.

Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"<br><br>""I can't do it,"" said Anna. Her voice was shaky and hollow. ""I'm not going to do this.""<br><br>Mike stood in front of her, his face contorted with anger. ""Anna, you signed a contract. You promised me that you would take this job.""<br><br>The two were in Anna's small apartment behind the school where she worked as a janitor. It had been ten minutes since Mike had stormed into the room. Up until he arrived, Anna had been packing her belongings, getting ready to leave her job as a janitor at an exclusive school in Brooklyn Heights and travel back home to California for good. She hadn't exactly planned on leaving just yet, but when Mike had told her about the new janitor that he'd hired for her position, she'd realized immediately that there was no point in staying any longer. She'd always loved New York City and this particular job, but she knew that it wasn't meant to be hers forever; it was time for something else to happen in her life now. But what? She'd never seen herself as a janitor: that wasn't who she was or who she wanted to be. Unfortunately, though, it seemed like what Mike wanted from her now was just that.<br><br>""You need to calm down,"" she said calmly. She was trying to keep her cool despite how scary Mike could be when he got angry. ""You're not making sense right now.""<br><br>""I'm not making sense? You're the one who's not making sense! You promised me that you'd work at this school as a janitor for as long as I needed you, and now you're saying that you're going to quit? I just don't understand! What is so bad about this school, Anna?! What have I done to make you hate it?""<br><br>""I don't hate it,"" said Anna quickly. ""I can't stand it anymore, okay? It's been six months since I've started working here, and nothing has changed. There's no way that anyone would start something like this just so they can keep it up for years at a time without any intention of ending it sooner.""<br><br>""But of course there are things on the books that have to take time before they can be fulfilled,"" said Mike quickly, his head shaking back and forth in disbelief. ""That's why this is such an opportunity for others like us; after all, we've had the benefit of years of careful planning.""<br><br>""What do you mean?"" asked Anna.<br><br>Mike looked like he was about to drop another bomb on her. ""Anna, look around you! We're standing in an office. This is where I meet with other coworkers every day to discuss our progress and what to do next.""<br><br>Anna looked around the room even as she pulled her eyes away from Mike's face. She wasn't sure if she wanted to see what he was showing her or not, but all of his talk about coworkers had made her curious; after all, she'd found nothing of the sort on this floor when she'd cleaned it before he came in and started talking about making a group of workers at his company or something. ""I don't see any-"" she started to say, but that was all that came out before she caught sight of something on the wall. It wasn't anything big: just a blackboard with some scribbles written on it. But as soon as her eyes landed on it, Anna's jaw dropped open in surprise and shock. What were those words? They didn't seem like they were written by anyone who worked at the school; they seemed...like something else entirely...something much more sinister...<br><br>""It's been part of my plan all along,"" Mike told her. Anna could tell that he was getting agitated, but she didn't care. She was afraid to look at him, afraid of the anger in his eyes; he might have been a good-looking man for his age, but the truth about him was that he had a cold and dark soul. ""I've been planning this for months.""<br><br>""You've been planning it?"" asked Anna, her voice so high in pitch that she almost didn't recognize it. ""What are you going to do? Tell me!""<br><br>""I'm not going to tell you,"" said Mike with a sneer. ""At least not right now. But I will say this: don't put too much into those scribbles on that blackboard."" Anna followed his gaze and looked back at the words on the board again: they seemed familiar somehow, but then again they didn't...it was so hard to remember what she'd seen before this moment...<br><br>""Are you going to let me go soon?"" asked Anna as she glanced back at Mike's face and saw nothing but rage there now; he seemed angrier than ever before, his eyes wild as he walked around behind her desk with quick steps. ""Where are you going?""<br><br>""I've got to get back to the meeting,"" he said, checking the time on his sleek, high-tech watch. ""Remember this place and what you see here when you look around,"" he whispered as he came back around her desk and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. ""And think of your daughter. I know you have her tucked away somewhere safe and sound, but just in case she doesn't stay safe...""<br><br>""What?"" asked Anna as she pushed his arms away from her. ""What is that supposed to mean? Tell me!""<br><br>""It means what it means,"" said Mike; he was standing only a foot away from her now, one hand on her desk and the other leaning on a wall for support, but Anna couldn't help but notice how unhealthy he looked. He was covered in sweat, his eyes surrounded by dark circles that were so prominent that they even showed up through his make-up; something was definitely wrong with him...otherwise...why else would a man like him stand close enough for Anna to touch him? He'd already told her about why people like them were there; it didn't make any sense for him to act like this unless something had gone terribly wrong... ""I wish I",1
"Kitty Pawsky, the world's greatest detective, agrees to take on a case in which a string of murders have been committed in a dog park.","<br><br>A small feline detective walked through the streets of London. She had a gift for solving crimes, and her name was Kitty Pawsky. Her mind was focused on just one thing this evening: the case she was working on.<br><br>""I must solve this case before I lose my mind,"" Kitty muttered to herself. She was filled with such stress and tension that she often spoke her thoughts aloud, like a normal human.<br><br>Kitty found it weird to be doing such a thing as walking around without a job to do, but she needed some rest in order to solve the case. Even though she had been awake for many nights trying to crack it, she could not give up just yet after so much hard work.<br><br>But now, sitting on the bench in front of her house, Kitty felt a bit tired. In fact, it looked like she was close to falling asleep right there and then – and dreams were beckoning her! But Kitty would never succumb to such things as dreams; they would only distract her from solving cases like this one!<br><br>And yet…the detective could feel herself being pulled into them…unconsciously…<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>Kitty woke up from being knocked over.<br><br>""What the..."" Kitty mumbled. She looked around for the source of the knocking and saw that it had been a dog's tail. He walked away with his tail wagging happily, almost as if he was proud of what he had done.<br><br>""That little devil,"" Kitty said to herself. ""If he knocked me over on purpose, this case is going to be even more difficult.""<br><br>Kitty got up and continued walking towards her house. She noticed that it was 6 AM, and all the other cats in the neighborhood were getting up to go to work or school or whatever they were doing. Their work days were much shorter than this one was going to be, since she still had a whole day ahead of her until she could sleep again. But she felt confident that by that time, she would have solved this case once and for all!<br><br>""I hope I don't run into that dog,"" Kitty thought to herself as she walked along. ""Otherwise, I will probably get knocked down again!""<br><br>A small smile spread across her face as she imagined him trying it. He would probably trip over his own feet and fall on his face! This made Kitty quite happy; at least her mind was distracted from the case for a little while.<br><br>Her mind wandered to other things, including how she solved the case. Perhaps she could get Mr. Bigglesworth, the head of all detectives in Britain, to help her? He had solved many difficult cases and was known for his keen intellect and amazing skills as a detective.<br><br>""I will have to ask him if he can help me with this case,"" Kitty decided.<br><br>She knew that he would be willing to help as long as she showed him the true skill and determination required of a master detective like Mr. Bigglesworth himself. If Kitty was truly determined to solve this case, then he would do anything in his power to make sure it got done right! Kitty had heard that he once chased down an evil magician named Zatanna Zatara through England, France and Italy until they finally caught her! And Mr. Bigglesworth was only three-and-a-half years old at that time!<br><br>Suddenly, Kitty felt something brush against her leg – it seemed like it might have been a tail this time! But there were no dogs near her now; just cats who were on their way somewhere else in London. She looked around, but could not see anyone nearby who had bumped into her this time. It was probably just her imagination, Kitty thought to herself.<br><br>When she arrived at her house, the detective noticed that there was a man standing in front of the door. He had his hand raised as if he was about to knock on the door himself! Whatever he wanted with Kitty Pawsky, she hoped it was not to challenge her detective skills. She was already feeling tired from having solved so many cases – or attempted to solve them – in the past few days!<br><br>""Can I help you?"" Kitty asked. ""Are you here for a case?""<br><br>The man shook his head and said that it would be better if they spoke inside the house instead of on the doorstep; he did not want anyone else hearing what he had to say to Kitty.<br><br>""All right,"" she agreed and let him into the house. ""My apologies for my manners,"" she added once they were both inside. ""I should have offered you something to drink before inviting you into my home.""<br><br>""Oh, it's quite all right,"" he replied. His voice seemed familiar yet strangely exotic and foreign at the same time…but there was something else about him that Kitty could not quite place.<br><br>Once she was seated on the sofa, he sat beside her on the narrow cushion with his hands resting in his lap and his legs crossed at the ankles. He looked as if he was about to tell her a story or something, but Kitty did not know what he had to say. She hoped it was nothing bad because it seemed that there were so many unpleasant things happening lately!<br><br>""I will get right to the point,"" the man said. ""I wish to challenge your skills as a detective.""<br><br>""Huh?"" Kitty thought, suddenly feeling a little bit confused. ""What do you mean? I thought that you wanted me to help you with something!""<br><br>""Indeed I do,"" he replied with a calm and confident smile. ""But before we can begin our case together, I must know whether you are truly worthy of my time or not.""<br><br>""Worthy of your time?"" Kitty repeated – she was even more confused now!<br><br>The man nodded once more and said that this was true; he would only want to work with someone who could be a worthy detective like himself. This made Kitty feel pretty good inside, even though she did",0

Posted: Feb 6, 2013 - 4:19 PM By: Ron Hardcastle (Member)<br><br>I don't know how ""the business is"" these days, but years ago when it was common practice for studios to make deals with agents -- usually 10% of their clients' salaries -- and then to pay the agents for the privilege of taking on the client's work, at some point it got around that if you could have a client who could make a studio money under any circumstances, the deal was even better. Enter, years ago, a novel by an English author -- can't remember his name off-hand -- whose novel was then republished in America by one of the major publishing houses. The novel was not as dull and dreary as its predecessor, so there was reason to be encouraged. Then they discovered that the author's ""agent"" (no signatures were ever produced) had negotiated a deal (in the back room with no other participants) whereby the author got 10% of all profits on any film version of his book.<br><br>The book did not do well in England; I don't know if it was published elsewhere or if it sold enough copies in this country to warrant an American publication. And even if so, no publishing house wanted to take on this story which would have cost them millions in advance advances to put out, because there just wasn't much of a chance that they would ever see any return from it.<br><br>So now studios are cautious about deals with ""novelists"" who, for one reason or another, do not get the kind of career-boosting recognition that might justify a big investment.<br><br>In the end, I think it comes down to the fact that a studio (or any business) must be regarded by its investors as being solvent and able to survive economically in order to attract investors. Investors don't want to risk their own money on a business that has very little chance of surviving.<br><br>And so we're left with nothing but musicals and superheroes!<br><br>Hardcastle, my sources are often on the record. But I can neither reveal them nor repeat what they said on the record. (I have enough trouble with my taxes as it is.)<br><br>But here's another off-the-record story -- I cannot give you all details because the contract is sealed.<br><br>Last year a well-known screenwriter and producer sold a book manuscript to a major publishing house. The contract was signed in the presence of both his agent and his manager. It was then forwarded to the production side of his agency, who took out part of it and forwarded it to a studio with whom they had a prior relationship with, at which time the studio then came back and made certain changes in it that were covered by their own talent deals lawyers. The writer's manager knew about these changes although not about their ramifications, but for some reason he never told his client about them, even after he saw another version of the contract which removed all references to this producer or project going to this particular studio, apparently because their planned production schedule conflicted with something else going on with them at that studio. So when he retired from management years later and those producers came back looking for him to help them find another agent for this movie, he told them he had no idea who the new agent was, and let them go to the then-present management agency for production deals.<br><br>The writer's former manager was never on the writer's pension plan (not because of the contract -- that would have been illegal -- but because of finances) and he died of cancer many years ago. The writer became a client of that agency in their production deals department, and it took them several years to even realize what he had been regarding as a ""live"" book project all that time. Then they went back to his old deal with the publishing house, realized it was still valid, even though it had never been activated by them (they didn't know about it), and sold the book for something like $400,000 to one of our major studios.<br><br>So now there is another film in production -- one more than I'm quite sick of seeing -- which at least has a chance of getting made now. Hardcastle: And so we're left with nothing but musicals and superheroes! That may be true - but nothing new is coming out anyway! Suckers' choice!<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>19 PM By: Ron Hardcastle (Member)<br><br>Re: A NOTE FROM HARDCASTLE: BUT HE DREAMS ON!<br><br>For those of you who were at the Hollywood Bowl last night, I can report that James Newton Howard came out to a rousing ovation and played wonderfully with his band.<br><br>As always, I was especially mesmerized when he performed the big, brass-backed theme from ""The Fugitive."" I've watched that movie maybe a dozen times since it was first released in 1993, and like it better each time. But until seeing the live performance last night of those themes, I had never realized how similar in style they are to the main theme from ""Batman Returns."" It made me realize that Danny Elfman has been using a lot of the same musical tricks in both scores -- though they're very different in story.<br><br>And Howard's playing wasn't at all like Elfman's; there was nothing like his version of ""The Fugee"" (with most of the melody played by trombone) which is one of my favorite passages. And since Jack Nitzsche was also living when recording for this film, perhaps Howard also felt more freedom to play more jazz-influenced passages as well. (That's not",0
"John Doe, the serial killer, tells Valerie that she must escape the basement before dawn or else she will become his next trophy.","became aware, then, that there was something sticky on her mouth, and a gag holding it shut from behind. She moved a hand to grab it with both hands, trying to pull it off… and found that it would not budge. She tugged at it furiously for a few moments, until she felt exhaustion setting in. The high-pitched whine of frustration died away into despairing silence as the last bit of energy left her body.All she could do now was wait and wonder what this place was; to fear what might happen next. What had happened before? The memories came back reluctantly -- a black car, the attacker's close-cropped hair, his piercing eyes as he stared at her, his hand reaching for something in his pocket…A part of her brain registered an odd smell. It was faint, but it was definitely present. The smell of decay…-----------------------------You can try the full version of this game by clicking here.

In particular, she meets an old woman whose tapping toe seems to foretell bad things happening. Premise Analysis & Evaluation : I have always been a fan of the horror genre, especially when it comes to slasher films and other films with strange happenings that lead to deaths. The first thing that came to mind when I read this premise was the movie ""Poltergeist"", which also deals with supernatural happenings in an apartment complex. I think that this premise lends itself very well as a horror film because of how strange it is in comparison to normal activities in an apartment complex, let alone everyday life. It would be interesting if the writer delves into why some of these activities happen, which is something I normally enjoy seeing in horror films. Premise Analysis & Evaluation (Cont'd): There isn't much to do here except for creating a good story. I feel that this premise lends itself greatly for a ghost story, because ghost stories often deal with bizarre happenings that don't make sense. A good writer could make the protagonist's new apartment complex a haunted one, and the reader could find themselves being scared as the protagonist is. However, I also like the idea of making this a time travel film because every supernatural story is essentially a time travel story (another example would be ""The Butterfly Effect""). There are two different outcomes here: either make it a ghost story or make it into an actual time travel film.<br><br>Premise Analysis & Evaluation (Cont'd): An issue I had when writing this analysis was how to present the information in comparison to other stories on FictionPress. One way of doing so is to compare/contrast it with movies or other similar ideas around on FictionPress, which is something that's usually done when writing an analysis. The problem with doing so is that there really isn't any other stories similar to ""Tap Toes Doorstep"" out there on FictionPress--at least not ones with similar premises--so it would be difficult to make comparisons. The only way of solving this problem is to not make comparisons, which would be a shame. Therefore, I decided to stop doing analysis in this manner and instead talk about the premise itself and its positives and negatives, which is something that a lot of other writers do (and have done).<br><br>I have always been a fan of the horror genre, especially when it comes to slasher films and other films with strange happenings that lead to deaths.

Mary Smith walks home from work and becomes the victim of a mugging attempt by John Doe.,"The alley was dark. It was a short walk from the corner where Mary Smith had been walking, but she still didn’t trust it. Mary fidgeted the whole way, watching all around her for anyone who might be lurking in the shadows. She didn’t like this alley; it was dark and dusty and full of trash.<br><br>She crossed over to the other side, trying to get farther away from the alley’s entrance, but a group of teens were standing there smoking pot. They looked at her with smirks on their faces – they knew what Mary was doing and were probably laughing at her behind her back. One of them leaned over and grabbed Mary by the shoulders, demanding that she hand over whatever she had in her pockets.<br><br>Mary Smith stood rooted to the spot, unable to move as John Doe pushed into her personal space. He demanded that she empty her pockets right then and Mary Smith panicked. She dug for her purse in her bag, hoping that inside were some items of value that she could give him. Instead, she only came up with some receipts and a few coins. She hoped those would suffice, but John Doe demanded more.  He got angry when she told him that this was all she had.<br><br>“You were just at the corner shop!” he screamed at her. “Didn’t you just buy something?”<br><br>Mary Smith wanted to cry. When John Doe realized that Mary Smith wasn’t going to give him more money, he moved in closer to her. Then she noticed the gun in his hand and she began to tremble.<br><br>“If you don’t give me everything, I’ll kill you,” he threatened. <br><br>Mary Smith reached into her bag again, hoping there was something else she could find to appease him. She felt around in her purse and eventually, her hand connected with the contents of her wallet — which John Doe was now demanding she hand over. Mary Smith did as John Doe told her and handed him the contents of her wallet.<br><br>He demanded more money, but at this point, Mary Smith only had change. John Doe began to look through her wallet in search of more cash but what he found was a photograph. He stared at it for a moment and then turned toward Mary Smith once again. <br><br>“Give me your phone,” he demanded. “I know you have one.”<br><br>Mary Smith suddenly realized that she had been so caught up in not giving him any more money that she hadn’t even considered the possibility that John Doe might want to take her phone. John Doe became angry when he found no other valuables in Mary Smith’s pocket; he told her to turn over the contents of her purse and to empty her pockets, but she had already removed everything that she thought he could possibly want.<br><br>She searched through her bag again but all that was inside was her purse, a few receipts, and a pack of gum — none of which John Doe apparently wanted.<br><br>Mary Smith began to feel hopeless. Surely there was nothing left of her belongings that could be of any value to John Doe. She started to become angry herself — how dare John Doe demand more from her",1
Shannon's paintings begin to take on a life of their own and Shannon starts to feel like her paintings are her new family.,"the paintings were talking to her, and she responded back through them. When she felt close to someone, Shannon would often give her paintings as gifts and tell people that they were her family.<br><br>Shannon continued to paint and show her paintings around town, and people began to notice them. She was invited by various places to have an exhibit of her paintings, and she started to make a little money from selling them. This made her very proud.<br><br>Shannon’s uncle saw how much she enjoyed painting and helped to build a small studio in the attic of their house for her. She soon filled up the studio with paintings, and it became very crowded.<br><br>Katie Matthews was now a friend of Shannon’s, and she also painted. Katie didn’t think she was very good at painting but felt inspired by Shannon Daniels who encouraged her to draw and paint whenever she could. They often painted together when they were at each other’s houses.<br><br>Shannon continued her journey as an artist, and she entered a variety of exhibits. Her paintings became recognizable throughout the town, and people often stopped to look at them when they passed by.<br><br>Shannon’s paintings became popular enough that she was able to make a living from them. Her uncle helped her rent a small office in town where she sold her paintings.<br><br>She continued to enter art shows, and now even her painting teacher had heard of her and asked if she would show some of her paintings in an exhibit on campus for students who were interested in pursuing careers in the arts.<br><br>Katie Matthews entered the art show with Shannon Daniels, and they both displayed many of their paintings. They talked to each other about how much fun it was to see their works hanging on the walls at the art show.<br><br>One evening after all the exhibits were closed for the night, Shannon and Katie were looking at the gallery one last time. They were admiring their work when they noticed someone standing in the shadows staring at their paintings. Shannon and Katie quickly moved over to the entrance of the exhibit so that they could get a better look at who was standing there.<br><br>“Who are you?” asked Shannon.<br><br>The man stepped into the light and said, “I’m sorry. I just wanted to come by and see your paintings, but I didn’t mean to disturb you. Some of these paintings are really good, and the  one you have hanging up over there is especially beautiful.” The man pointed at Shannon’s favorite painting—a large red rose with green leaves and a red ribbon tied around it.<br><br>“Thank you for the compliment,” said Shannon. “Are you an artist?”<br><br>The man took a closer look at Shannon’s favorite painting, then he smiled. “You caught me. I’m Rosemary Jacobs, and I teach art at the high school here in town.”<br><br>Shannon felt compelled to tell Rosemary about her mother’s art class, and how much the painting meant to her. “I think my mom painted this, but she passed away a couple of years ago from cancer. It was the last thing she gave me before she died and it means so much to me.”<br><br>A look of compassion and concern washed over Rosemary’s face. “I’m sorry Shannon; I didn’t mean to bring up painful memories. I just wanted to say that you have beautiful talent, and I think your paintings are amazing. You should show these at the art festival next month.”<br><br>Shannon was moved by Rosemary’s kindness, and she really enjoyed talking to her. “Thank you, again, Rosemary. I’ll think about it. I appreciate all the compliments on my art work, but I haven’t shown anyone else what I’ve painted. This is my first painting class. My mom gave me some paints years ago, but I never really used them. She said they were hers when she was younger and she thought that I might enjoy them. So, I decided to pick up a brush and try it out for myself,” Shannon finished.<br><br>“I think you should share what you have created with others. I think it would be so great if you could enter your artwork into the art festival next month, “Rosemary said enthusiastically.<br><br>“I think I could do that, Rosemary. But I’m moving soon to a new house with my dad and Uncle John, and I really couldn’t paint in my new house. My old studio is in my attic, and it is pretty cramped up there. It would be such a mess if I tried to paint there. My dad suggested I contact  someone who had an office for rent. So, I rented the one you found for me, and now I can paint there.”<br><br>“That is wonderful! You are so talented and creative. What you create is beautiful, Shannon! You could have a really successful art career.” Rosemary was very excited about Shannon’s future career as an artist.<br><br>Shannon smiled, “I doubt that, Rosemary. But if it happens, that would really be great! I think Katie should enter her artwork into the exhibit too. We both would enjoy it so much, and I think our paintings would look nice hanging next to each other.”<br><br>Rosemary smiled, “I agree that would be a wonderful idea. Let’s call up Katie and ask her to enter the show.”<br><br>Shannon had forgotten all about the conversation with Uncle Jeff about entering her artwork into the art festival, which Shannon and Rosemary had planned to do that afternoon.<br><br>Rosemary hung up the phone and said, “Shannon, I have some exciting news. I just called over to talk to your Uncle Jeff and he said that you can submit your artwork for the art gallery show at college. Shannon, that is so exciting!”<br><br>Shannon was excited too. The prospect of having her artwork in a show was thrilling to her. “Wow, I am so glad you told me about it, Rosemary! Now I know what to do with all those pictures I have in my attic. Shannon’s attic was full of boxes filled with canvases. There were large canvases stacked on top of smaller canvases that were stacked on top of more boxes. There were paintings of all shapes and sizes in the boxes. Some were framed and others were not, but all of them had the same signature in the bottom corner. Shannon thought she recognized the signature. She thought it was her mother’s.<br><br>Shannon moved a box out from in front of her, so she could see better. The signature said: Shannon Daniels and below that was written: 1996-2009. Shannon wiped away tears and smiled. “I can’t believe my mom painted these pictures of me! They must have been painted when I was three years old, because I remember that is when my mom said I got paint on my dress and then on my hair too. I wonder why she never showed them  to me when I was a little girl?”<br><br>Rosemary looked at the canvases with Shannon. “I don’t know why she never showed you these paintings when you were smaller, but maybe now that you are older, you will be able to appreciate them more.”",1
Anna Cooper must find a way to stop the darkness from taking over the school and protect the innocent students.,"she was finally going to get her daughter back.<br><br>""You're still not leaving though, are you?"" asked Mike; he shook his head and gestured the door again. ""Fine. You want to stay? Fine. I can't stop you from staying."" He turned his face away from Anna and started muttering to himself again, while Anna started pulling herself up off of the floor. ""Just don't get in my way,"" he said darkly, as Anna got back onto her feet. ""I'm not going to be happy about having you here.""<br><br>""I don't care about your happiness,"" she whispered under her breath as she made her way toward the door. No matter what this guy did or said, Anna couldn't believe that Scott was dead...it just seemed impossible that he wouldn't be there waiting for her to come home any second now with Sophie in tow, ready to tickle his toes and make him laugh while they did homework together. She couldn't believe a word of what Mike was saying...and the more she thought about it, the more she wondered how in the hell somebody could be such a liar for so many years without getting himself caught somehow in all that time.<br><br>""Sophie,"" said Anna, when she finally made it out of the room, as she turned and locked eyes with Mike. ""We're going to get Sophie now.""<br><br>""Yeah,"" scoffed Mike. ""I'll bet you will."" He waved his hand at Anna and rolled his eyes. ""Just go over there to that front door and turn left, the door on the right is opened by a keypad I keep behind the front desk in my office. You can't miss it...there's a big sign on the wall right next to it too.""<br><br>""Oh yeah?"" asked Anna, rolling her eyes at him in return as she glared at him once more. ""Well I'm sure I'll be able to get myself out of here without you holding my hand..."" She took a deep breath and started walking down the hall toward the front desk that he had pointed out, wondering if this was really how things were going to be from now on...she couldn't imagine ever getting used to having Mike around enough to want him anywhere near her or her daughter; this was going to be torture for everyone involved...the only question was whether or not Sophie would take any of what was happening seriously, or if she'd just end up laughing about it like she always did about everything.<br><br>* * * * *<br><br>""Here's your key,"" said Mike as he handed a card over to Anna. ""I've got a code for you that will get you in the first door, and then you can just walk right into the office where I keep my stuff. The door on the right is the one with your daughter in there."" Looking up at her, he paused and took a deep breath before saying, ""That's it. You're here...this is your run of the place now.""<br><br>""Yeah?"" asked Anna; she gave him an evil stare and shook her head at him as she unlocked the office door on the right of the main desk. ""Well I don't need to tell you that this isn't going to be exactly what I'm used to...I'm not sure if you have any idea how much Sophie means to me."" She rolled her eyes at him, unlocked the door and stepped inside. ""I'll do whatever I have to do, but if anything happens to her..."" She left her words hanging in midair as she disappeared into the office and shut out Mike for good; all she wanted now was for Sophie to be safe and sound with no more digs about being crazy or anything like that.<br><br>""Sophie?"" she called out, as she looked around the room, hoping that her daughter wasn't still sleeping or hiding from her, but it was impossible to see much of anything with all of the boxes piled everywhere. Moving forward to search the room a little more thoroughly, Anna found that Sophie's bag was nowhere to be seen; she wasn't sure if that was a good sign or not...she had never been one to hold onto things even after she'd abandoned them...and if she had taken off with Mike it could be anywhere by now.<br><br>""Don't worry,"" said Mike as he stepped into the office behind Anna; he gave a wave of his hand as if brushing away her worries and added, ""All of that is gone now. I got it all in storage...just in case.""<br><br>""In case of what?"" asked Anna. ""Why would you do that? And where did you put my daughter?"" She paused for a moment and then pressed on, thinking about the thought that had popped into her mind and seeming to realize something for the first time. ""You know...I'm not sure about this whole thing..."" She pressed herself against one wall and stared at him as she added, ""I think I want to get out of here...I'm not sure if this is the right place for me or Sophie. There's something very wrong with this place...I can feel it.""<br><br>""Don't worry,"" said Mike, ""it's gonna be fine. Just tell me what you need and I'll make sure it gets taken care of. You're just supposed to be cleaning up the place and that's pretty much it, right?"" He paused for a moment before adding, almost as an afterthought, ""Besides that I guess you can stay in the office in case anyone else needs to be let in or something...""<br><br>""What do you mean by that?"" asked Anna; she narrowed her eyes at him and took a deep breath before adding, ""It doesn't look like anyone else is coming here...at least not for a long time."" Shaking her head at him slightly, she added, ""But if I have to stay up here all night I guess I can handle it..."" She paused for a moment and then gestured toward him with open hands as she added, ""But I'm telling you now...I don't want you near me or my daughter while I'm here."" She leaned forward slightly and glared at him before saying quietly but firmly,",1
"Jack goes through the motions of living, but he can't see any purpose in it without her.","that you'd still be here with me...""<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>It was supposed to be good for him to get out of the house; that was part of the reason why Jack had agreed to come in the first place. He didn’t want his daughter-in-law to worry about him watching too much television or spending too much time by himself, even though he knew she did worry about him anyway. This was one way that she’d found to try and get him out of that house and onto his feet again, and so far it seemed to be working.<br><br>He hadn’t said anything yet, but even he could see that this wasn’t really making a difference, at least not yet. He hadn’t been back home at all today; hadn’t had any time alone with her or heard her voice in his mind at all on this visit either. But Jack was beginning to wonder if any of it really mattered anymore-if there really was any reason after all for him to keep trying as hard as he was doing right now. He wasn’t even sure exactly what he wanted anymore; what it would take for him to finally accept that she was gone forever...and never coming back.<br><br>""I'm sorry, Eliza,"" he said remorsefully, wiping the tears out of his eyes again as he stared at one of the buildings that bordered this cemetery. ""I can't give up on you, but I don't understand why I even bother anymore.""<br><br>It was quiet in there; too quiet for it to be real, as if every other person that had ever been buried here had left him behind so that he would be all alone now. Jack knew that wasn't true of course; even if it was somehow miraculously possible for someone to disappear without a trace like his wife had done, surely somebody else would have ended up sharing his grave with him by now. Whoever might have just died probably hadn't been born yet when Eliza had disappeared from life though, so it didn’t really matter; some things were beyond explanation no matter how much you tried to rationalize them and make sense of them.<br><br>""I can't be here anymore."" Jack knelt down and ran his fingers across the headstone where they'd left her name and dates forever fixed in stone like she was trapped there now too. ""Goodbye...Eliza,"" Jack whispered sadly as he stood up again, ""I love you.""<br><br>He turned away to make his way back towards the visitor’s center and almost felt like he could see her out of the corner of his eye, even though he knew he wasn't really there. Was it really going to feel like this every day from now on? He couldn't stand being there anymore; it was doing him no good at all.<br><br>""I've missed you,"" Jack said quietly-as if wherever she might be now would somehow hear his words and know that he meant them honestly, ""and I love you."" It was quiet in there; too quiet for it to be real, as if every other person that had ever been buried here had left him behind so that he would be all alone now. Jack knew that wasn't true of course; even if it was somehow miraculously possible for someone to disappear without a trace like his wife had done, surely somebody else would have ended up sharing his grave with him by now.

There never were when he came here, not even on the days when he would purposely come in the mornings before any of his co-workers could catch him here in order to be alone with her again.<br><br>""In a perfect world, nobody would ever have to lose somebody they loved."" Jack sighed softly as he knelt down again. It was ironic that even though they thought they'd had a perfect life together, it had been ripped to shreds and left irreparably broken now. ""I love you so much,"" he said again, as if it was a mantra he wanted to repeat over and over just in case she might be able to hear it somehow; ""and I miss you."" That was all there was around him now: just empty words that couldn't possibly make up for what had been lost.<br><br>“I’m sorry...I can’t do this anymore. I just can’t live without you, Eliza,"" Jack whispered sadly as he stepped away from her grave and headed for the visitor’s center once more. He couldn't live without her any longer; not even thinking about it from time to time",1
Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"<br><br>Jenna looked around her. The room was filled with several beds and the odd piece of equipment. There were curtains on most of the windows, but one was wide open and showed a brick wall outside. She looked back at Liam before speaking again. “What’s your name?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam smiled at that. “My name is Liam Cross, and I promise that I will not hurt you, no matter what anyone else tells you.”<br><br>Jenna thought about things for a few more seconds before asking another question. “Does everyone become a vampire? Is that what this is?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam shook his head. “Most people don’t become vampires, and it is definitely not something that you want to happen to you,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna looked at him curiously before asking a question that she had been thinking about for the last several minutes. “Where am I? How did I get here?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam stared at her for a moment. “You are in the hospital,” said Liam, answering her second question first. “The police found you in an alley.”<br><br>Jenna looked at him to make sure he was telling the truth. She looked at the room around her, and then back at Liam. “Where is everyone else? I don’t see anyone else here,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam smiled for a moment before shaking his head. “You’re the only person here, right now, but the police are looking for other people who might have been with you at the time of your attack that they might have left behind. You were there quite a while before they found you, and you’re very lucky to be alive,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna looked around the room again, and then back at him. “I don’t understand what happened to me, but I feel like it was more than being attacked and left for dead in an alley,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam nodded for a moment before speaking again. “You are right about that, although I don’t know everything about what happened either,” said Liam. He pulled his jacket out from where he kept it under the chair by his bed, and handed it to  her. “When we meet someone for the first time, as is customary in our kind of society, we give them something small as a token of trust. I hope this isn’t too much for you to carry around with you,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna took the jacket from him and slipped it on. It fit her perfectly, almost as if it was made for her. “No, not at all. Thank you,” said Jenna as she smiled and looked back at him.<br><br>He nodded for a few minutes before speaking again. “I want to tell you something else that might answer some questions you have,” said Liam. “When a vampire is about to change, we experience a few events that give us more insight into what is coming. You were probably going through this and may have not realized it, or just forgot about it. When I saw you in the alley, I knew exactly who you were and what had just happened to you,” said Liam as he leaned back more comfortably into his chair.<br><br>Jenna leaned forward slightly in her seat as she listened intently to what he was saying. She took a moment to think about what he said and decided to ask him a question as she leaned back in her chair. “In other words, you knew I was going to turn into a vampire,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam looked up at the ceiling for a few seconds, and then looked back at her. “Yes, that is sort of what I’m saying. We all go through this when we are about to change,” he said as he looked back over at the front door.<br><br>Jenna shifted her eyes from one side of the room to another as she thought about how Elijah Sedgew ick might take what Liam was saying. She turned to look at the clock on the wall as she realized that it was late, and Elijah would be coming in soon if he wasn’t there already.<br><br>She turned away from the clock and back at Liam, who was still watching her carefully. “Where did you say you met each other?” asked Jenna as she shifted her weight in the chair.<br><br>“We met on the train to New York,” he said with a slight nod of his head. “I had just gotten on board and sat down in a seat next to you, as I was already quite tired from the trip up from Virginia. When I sat down you turned to look at me, and then took your phone out of your pocket and started typing away.”<br><br>Jenna listened as Liam spoke about their first meeting, but was having trouble picturing it in her mind. “Wait a minute,” she said as she looked at the clock and then back at Liam. “Are you saying that I got on this train by myself? When you first walked in here, I thought that I had been taken over by a vampire or something.”<br><br>Liam nodded. “Yes, and I know why you would think that. It is one of the things that leads up to a vampire’s transformation. They feel as if they are not traveling alone and have company with them on their journey, but when they look around they realize that no one else is there.”<br><br>Jenna nodded her head slowly trying to absorb everything Liam was telling her. “So that’s why I thought there was someone else in here with me?”<br><br>He nodded again. “It is possible because you were heading to New York, and I know that Antonia Rossi lives in New York. She is a very powerful vampire. She is the only person right now who holds the allegiance of most of the vampires in this country. She holds sway over a large number of vampires, both here and abroad. Every vampire who has turned to her for protection has been transformed into her kind. You have to go to New York and find her. She will be able to help you.”<br><br>Jenna moved away from the door, turning her back on Liam as she slid down until she was sitting on the floor in front of one of the seats. “New York ? What about Liam? I thought he was going with me.”<br><br>He shook his head solemnly. “I wish that I could, Jenna, but I can’t. Antonia is very powerful and has vast connections to all sorts of dark forces. If she finds out about me, then they will know that I am here. There wouldn’t be any point in traveling to NYC and going to her if she finds out that I am here. She would come looking for me immediately and, in the process, she would kill you.”<br><br>Jenna closed her eyes as she sighed heavily with resignation. “What’s the connection between Damian Henchman and Antonia? Why is he important to her?”<br><br>Liam looked at Jenna with a solemn expression as he said, “Damian is a vampire who has been to Italy recently. I think that you should go to Italy and find out if there are any clues to help you about your attacker. You could try New York first, but I think that it would be better if you went to Italy because it is less far away. Plus, it is closer to home for you",1
A group of survivors find themselves holed up in an old house in the middle of nowhere.,"<br><br>The survivors were huddled in one of the bedrooms. Their dim flashlights straining to pierce the stygian blackness enveloping them. No one sleeps well these days; too many nightmares keep them awake. The rotting corpses littering their path are enough to give anyone nightmares, but these ones were different. They weren't hallucinations brought on by exhaustion and hunger, they were real. The dead were rising again to feed on the living and the survivors knew it was only a matter of time before they themselves would end up like them.<br><br>They were gathered amongst a pile of overturned furniture, trying looking as inconspicuous as possible while peeping between cracks in the wall at what was going outside. They wanted to find out how close their pursuers had gotten and whether they would be able to sneak past them this time or if it would be another mad dash through abandoned streets filled with walking corpses. From what they could tell, there wasn't any clear way past without running into the rotting monstrosities and that was something that none of them wanted to do again if they could avoid it. The best thing for them now would be to stay quiet, wait until nightfall and then make a run for it when there was less light out there trying to illuminate their pale, flaking skin.<br><br>The night progressed and the survivors nervously waited for it to grow dark enough to make a run for it. They had been holed up in the house for days, scavenging from its empty rooms, rummaging through anything that could have some sort of use. There wasn't much left however, which was understandable considering how many people used to live here before most of them died from some sort of disease, but there should have been more left behind like empty cans and bottles or at least something that could help them survive out there in the ruins. There was nothing though; they had already scoured through everything that was left behind and knew they couldn't stay any longer. They were running low on food supplies and it would only get worse as the days passed by.<br><br>Finally night fell upon them and they were all ready to make a run for it when suddenly another sound came towards them from outside; a unearthly howl that seemed to reverberate through their bones. They were afraid but didn't know what to think; they had never heard anything like that before, but then again they'd never heard any sort of voice come out of any corpse either until now so anything was possible these days.<br><br>They froze, hoping that whatever was out there wouldn't notice them, but it turned out that they didn't have to worry because suddenly the door to their hiding place burst open and a figure stood there in the doorway, blocking off any chance of escape. It was so dark that they couldn't make out what it looked like but they could clearly see its long arms which seemed much too long for its body. They couldn't tell if it had two arms or not but the thing was standing in the doorway just staring at them, emitting those bloodcurdling howls.<br><br>It took another step towards them and revealed part of its face; a set of grey eyes were glowing brightly in the darkness and it's mouth was open wide with several rows of teeth lined up inside its maw. It lumbered towards them without making a sound.<br><br>Someone shouted for everyone to run when suddenly one of their flashlights went on and illuminated part of the thing's face as it lunged forward with its hands reaching for them.<br><br>They all managed to get out of there while screaming hysterically and fleeing down the stairs, out through an open window. The thing chased after them as they desperately tried to get away from that awful house but it didn't seem to be able to catch up with them...<br><br>They ran as fast as they could through the dark alleys, hoping it would give up on them and leave them alone but they could still hear it howling behind them, getting closer with every step. They were sure they were going to die; they didn't know what the hell that thing was but something told them that it wouldn't let them get away so easily.<br><br>Suddenly one of the survivors tripped on a loose brick and fell flat on his face, making everyone else stop in their tracks. The thing stopped too though and turned its gaze towards him; it seemed uninterested in him for some reason, leaving him there in the middle of the street for a moment before turning its attention back towards the rest of his group. With no time to waste, he tried to get up and run after his friends when suddenly he felt someone grab his hand and pull him back into a small alleyway nearby. It was too dark for him to make out who it was that had pulled him into there but he heard a familiar voice whispering: ""Come on!""<br><br>He turned around and saw...himself. His double must have been following right behind him without anyone noticing because now here he was, standing in front of him, looking at him with those same grey eyes he saw on the thing that was chasing after them.<br><br>He could barely believe his eyes when his double spoke to him again; something about how he should've stayed hidden and not go after them, that it would be dangerous for all of them if he were to do so. Even if what his double said made sense, he still didn't want to leave when a part of the monster's face came into view as it leaned over the edge of the building and stared down at them with its glowing eyes. He could feel himself shaking uncontrollably as the thing tried to get a better look at what was going on in the alley below before turning back around and walking away. They had somehow managed to escape it this time but they couldn't afford to take any more risks like that; they needed to get out while they still could.<br><br>None of them complained when his double told them that dinner would be ready soon, even though it was already late into the night. His sister had gone into one of the rooms with her boyfriend and everyone else went inside as well, knowing full well what would happen now; even though they still felt hungry and tired as hell, there",0
Daisy Mayberry receives a diagnosis of cancer and her family and friends come together to support her.,"<br><br>Daisy got worse over the weekend and her family didn’t know what to do. They were all standing around her bedside, looking helpless. She was the youngest of six children and had just gotten married two months ago. The bride was now a stricken woman about to lose everything she knew for over seven years. Daisy lost her husband a week before he was due to come back from his tour in Iraq, after not seeing each other for nearly twelve months.<br><br>Her mother sat on a chair in the corner holding her hand. Her father stood with his head down wiping his eyes with his sleeves; his oldest son stood next to him crying silently while leaning on his father’s shoulder. The rest of Daisy’s family members stood around them crying silently too.<br><br>Daisy started thrashing around in pain and they decided that they needed to act fast or it would be too late; they needed to find someone who could help them before their daughter slipped away forever, and right now it looked like there wasn’t much of a chance that would happen anytime soon; she wouldn’t last more than five minutes if this pain did not stop soon, not without something helping her quickly, which meant that they had to find someone who could help her as soon as possible.<br><br>Her mother grabbed the phone and called 9876, which is what people usually did when they were in such dire need of help, especially since no one knew anyone who could help them with this kind of problem. She dialed the number and waited, “Hello, I need to speak to someone who can help me with a dying friend or relative” she said into the receiver.<br><br>The operator on the other end of the line asked her a few questions and then told her that because it was critical they would call back in a few minutes. A few minutes later she received a phone call back from one of their operators who was going to send someone as soon as possible to help them.<br><br>Daisy was thrashing around trying to get away from the pain she was experiencing at that moment; she couldn’t understand why everyone else didn’t feel the pain she felt; after all it wasn’t just a little pain anymore, people never warned her that it would turn out like this. She would have gone on living normal if not for this plague! Why had no one warned her what it would be like? Now everyone around her looked on as if she was just crying, but it was the pain she felt that made her cry; it was horrible and no one could fix this.<br><br>Her mother looked up at the clock, praying that someone would come soon, her daughter needed help and she couldn’t take this anymore; she cried for this innocent girl who had never done anything to anyone and now because of one stupid decision had to go through something like this. It may have been her time to go but why couldn’t her time have been a few years from now? Why now? Why at nineteen years old with so much ahead of her? She could be more than what everyone thought she would be if only they had more time.<br><br>The doorbell rang and everyone looked at each other as if they were saying “now what?” Daisy’s father walked over to the door and opened it, “I’m here for the dying girl, you told us on the phone that you need our help. Is the girl still in agony? We don’t have much time; are you ready for us to get started or do we need to wait a bit longer until you think it is okay for us to start working? Have your family members chosen anyone in the room they want to be separated from and will they be okay with being put in a separate room or do they want to stay together?” said the man standing at their front door.<br><br>“We don’t want you to touch our daughter, we want you to let her go peacefully, can you just do that for us? I know it may not be how you normally handle things but that is what we want. We don’t care about anything else; all we care about is making sure that my daughter dies peacefully without any pain. Is there anything we can do for your service first? Money? Whatever it is we are willing to pay for it. We need this over with as soon as possible; my daughter has no idea what is happening to her so if it has nothing to do with pain then we are willing to allow it. If you have a way that she can die slowly and peacefully while not feeling any pain then please help her, she may not deserve this but she doesn’t deserve the torture she is going through either and there isn’t anyone who can help me make this better. Just give me some time alone with her until someone comes back, or make whatever deal you want with me; I’ll sign anything, just get this over with, but please no more pain for my Daisy,” she repeated.<br><br>The man looked at her and then looked at her daughter, “can you tell me why you are willing to pay any amount of money to have this thing go differently? None of us know your daughter or why she is the way she is but the way you spoke about her makes me think that she didn’t deserve this. Maybe there is something I can do for her; maybe our service really will make a difference. We will do what you request; we won’t touch your daughter at all, we will have someone come in to help your family stand guard while those who want to go make their final goodbyes. We will also send someone out to your house very soon so that they can take care of the arrangements that need to be made. I apologize if our actions seem abrupt or rude but we don’t encounter situations like this often so we don’t know how to do what you are asking, but we will try our best not to make it worse or cause more trouble than it already is.” He paused and looked at Daisy Mayberrys",0

It was a soft little kiss, but it still felt so good.<br><br>	When we broke the kiss, she gave me a little smile and then looked away for a second. “I’m sorry about that,” she said.<br><br>	I smiled and shook my head. “Don’t be,” I replied. “I enjoyed it. I’m just not used to that from you is all.”<br><br>	She bit her lip and smiled at me as she stared into my eyes. “You’re so beautiful, Nick,” she whispered.<br><br>	She was such a sweet woman and I loved her so much. I knew that she felt the same way about me, but I just didn’t think it was the best thing for us to be together. I mean, what kind of life would we have if we stayed together?<br><br>	She gently touched my cheek again and I felt myself get lost in her beautiful green eyes again. I did love her more than anything, but she was so good to me. She had done so much for me and I didn’t want to hurt her, but part of me was telling me that I needed to tell her the truth.<br><br>	“You’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen,” I replied.<br><br>	She smiled and kissed me lightly on the lips. “Thank you,” she whispered.<br><br>	I suddenly felt a cold chill run through my body and I started to shiver. My head hurt, but I didn’t understand why.<br><br>	Melissa looked at me and frowned. “Are you cold?” she asked.<br><br>	I nodded my head and closed my eyes as I tried to control my shivering.<br><br>	“It is a little chilly out here,” she replied as she touched my hand. “Why don’t you come on inside and you can get in bed for a while.”<br><br>	I tried to talk to her, but I couldn’t because I started to feel dizzy. It was like someone was squeezing my head too tight and I could feel the pain in the back of my head.<br><br>	“Nick, are you okay?” she asked with a worried expression on her face.<br><br>	Before I could reply, I felt myself black out.<br><br>	When I woke up, I was lying in my bed and it was dark outside. I wondered what had happened, but I didn’t remember anything.<br><br>	I sat up in bed and looked around. “Emma?” I called out.<br><br>	The room was silent and I didn’t hear anything. My heart started to race as I quickly got out of bed.<br><br>	I stumbled for a moment, but then I leaned against the wall for support. “Emma?” I called out again, but still there was no answer.<br><br>	I started to panic as I heard footsteps coming down the hall. “Emma?” I called out and I noticed that we were walking through our kitchen.<br><br>	Suddenly, the lights were turned on and I looked around in confusion. I frowned as I realized that my father was staring at me with a look of concern on his face.<br><br>	“Nick?” he asked.<br><br>	I didn’t know what to say, so I just stared at him in confusion. There was a moment of silence before my father spoke again.<br><br>	“What happened, Nick?” he asked as he walked over to me.<br><br>	 I felt a lump in my throat as I thought about how I could avoid telling him the truth.<br><br>	“I don’t know,” I replied.<br><br>	My father raised one of his eyebrows at me and tilted his head. “You don’t know?” he asked. “You just collapsed in the middle of your date with Melissa and were unconscious for the past twenty minutes. What do you think happened?”<br><br>	“I don’t know, Dad,” I replied as I shook my head.<br><br>	My father grabbed my shoulders and sat me down on a chair. “Nick, you’re going to have to tell me what happened. I want to help you, but you’re going to have to trust me and let me know what’s going on.”<br><br>	I stared at him, trying to find a way out of this. Why did he have to be so perceptive?<br><br>	He sat down next to me and stared into my eyes. “Tell me what happened, Nick?”<br><br>	I sighed and looked away from him. I didn’t want to tell",0
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"this point.<br><br>I walked back up the stairs and decided to check out my new kitchen. I opened the cabinets and found a few pots and pans. I looked for a knife, but didn’t see one in any of them. I started looking around for something to cut my food with when I noticed my refrigerator.<br><br>I hadn’t really looked at the refrigerator before, but now that I did, I realized that it was full. Unfortunately, there was nothing in there that I recognized. I looked around for a few minutes, but couldn’t find anything to cook with.<br><br>I decided that it was too early in the morning to think about food, so I walked back into the living room and sat down on the couch. I picked up one of the video games and started playing.<br><br> -----<br><br>The next morning, I woke up with a headache. It wasn’t a bad headache, but it was certainly enough to make me feel the need to take a shower. As I got out of bed and walked across the living room, I noticed that there was an alarm clock on the coffee table. The clock read 11:00 in the morning, so I had spent at least a few hours sleeping in.<br><br>I walked into the bathroom and turned on the water. I looked through my medicine cabinet for some aspirin, but didn’t see any in there. I opened my medicine cabinet and found a few bottles of prescription pills, but none of them had aspirin listed on the bottle.<br><br>I stepped into the shower and let the hot water run over me. It felt great, and I was starting to feel a lot better. I got out of the shower and dried off before putting on some clothes.<br><br>I didn’t even have to think about what I was going to wear. When I was packing up my things to move out, I made sure that I packed all of the clothes I owned. There were at least five sets of clothes in my closet.<br><br>The only problem was that I still didn’t remember how to get into my apartment. Every time I thought about it, it just got me more confused. There had to be a door somewhere, but where?<br><br>I decided that it would be best to ask one of my neighbors about the doors in my apartment. I went down to the living room and started looking for one of them. I walked around for a few minutes, but didn’t see any doors. I started getting a little frustrated, and was ready to call a locksmith when I found a door.<br><br>The door was at the end of the room near the kitchen. I opened it up and found myself standing in a hallway. This hallway had a door to my left and another one across from it. As I walked down the hallway, I decided that I should probably try to find out what was on the other side of the first door. If I was lucky, it would be a closet and I would be able to change into something else.<br><br>I walked over to the door and opened it up.<br><br>I was shocked to see that I didn’t find myself in a closet at all. Instead, I found myself in a bedroom. It was completely empty, except for a bed. There weren’t any drawers or even a desk to be found. This room was completely bare.<br><br>I walked around the room for a few minutes, but couldn’t find anything in there that would help me get some clothes. I decided that I would just have to find out what was on the other side of the second door.<br><br>As I walked over to the other door, I couldn’t help but think about how strange it was that there was a bedroom in my apartment that I didn’t even know about. Who decided to put the bedroom there, and when? It seemed to be completely random.<br><br>I opened the door and walked into the room.<br><br>I was standing in a spare bedroom. The bed was made, and there were a few books on the nightstand. There were two doors in this room as well. One of them led to the bathroom that I had been using last night, and the other one led to what looked like an office. Behind the desk was a lamp and a few papers. There was also a computer sitting on the desk, but it was turned off.<br><br>I decided that I would look for the spare bedroom when I was done in here. It could be useful to have an extra room in my apartment, especially one that has a bed in it. I got out some clothes and started changing. As I was changing, I started to wonder if the spare bedroom had a closet. That would really be useful, since I only had one closet in my room that I could use for all of my clothes.<br><br>I put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt before walking over to the door that led to the bedroom. I opened it up and started looking for a closet. Just as I was about to give up, I saw it, tucked away in the corner of the room.<br><br>I quickly walked over to the closet and started to look for things that would fit. I was hoping that there would be a ton of hangers, but that wasn’t the case. There were only five hangers in the closet, and they were all full. Luckily, all of the clothes on there were clothes that I didn’t own.<br><br>I picked out the first shirt I saw and tossed it on the bed. It was a light blue shirt with “Frolic” written across it in capital letters. I didn’t think that shirt looked very good on me and decided to just keep looking. The next shirt I picked up was for a little kid, so I threw that back on the ground. The next one was a yellow shirt with a picture of a taco on it. I didn’t really like that one either, so I kept looking.<br><br>The next shirt was red with a picture of a fish on it. It seemed like an obvious choice, so I grabbed it and put it",0
"When Natalie arrives at the address Trevor gave her, she quickly realizes that something isn't right and that Trevor might be a dangerous man .","now that they were in the same room together. Natalie Harper took a sip of her wine and smiled at Trevor Lockwood for a few seconds before answering his question. She told him that she had some ideas and he nodded his head at her.<br><br>Natalie Harper told Trevor Lockwood that she wanted to undress him, and kiss his body as he did the same to her. To add a little more excitement to the situation, she told Trevor Lockwood that they could include some foreplay with their clothes on as well.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was flattered by Natalie Harper’s forward reply and he moved closer to her on the couch. He moved his hand up the inside of Natalie Harper’s thigh and touched her crotch several times before stopping.<br><br>Natalie Harper leaned in to kiss Trevor Lockwood, but he pulled away from her instead. He explained to Natalie Harper that he still had some questions to ask her before moving forward with their plan.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood moved his hand up Natalie Harper’s skirt and he felt her underwear. He moved his fingers back and forth several times before stopping to talk again.<br><br>Natalie Harper was now moving her head back and forth to keep eye contact with Trevor Lockwood. She moved her legs into a more open position so that Trevor Lockwood could have easier access to her panties. She wanted him to move his hand inside of them, but she was going to have to wait a few more minutes before he did.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood moved his other hand up Natalie Harper’s stomach and he gently massaged her breasts through her top. He moved his fingers in a small circular pattern before stopping to talk again.<br><br>There was a small white hotel in the middle of nowhere about an hour from Trevor Lockwood’s small town, a hotel where no one ever went anymore. It would be the perfect place for them to stay in order to get everything they needed done on time.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood moved his hands down from Natalie Harper’s breasts and started unbuttoning her shirt. He pushed the small cotton fabric aside and moved his hands underneath of them to touch her bare breasts.<br><br>Natalie Harper was moving completely out of her comfort zone by agreeing to an in-person meeting with Trevor Lockwood. She was moving further out of it as he moved his hands all over her body, especially when she  could feel his hard cock against her crotch through their clothes.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood touched the soft skin without restraint and Natalie Harper held her breath as he squeezed her large breasts in his hands. He then moved his lips to the area above one of them and kissed the tender skin there.<br><br>Natalie Harper was already feeling turned on by Trevor Lockwood and she knew that when he felt her bare breasts, his arousal would increase. She was a little surprised at how turned on she was herself, considering how nervous she felt as Trevor Lockwood was undressing her. <br><br>Trevor Lockwood parted Natalie Harper’s thighs with his hands as he began to suck on one of her large breasts. After a few seconds, Natalie felt him move closer to her and she knew what was coming next.<br><br>The part of Natalie Harper that was not turned on by this situation was kicking in as Trevor Lockwood spread her legs and buried his face between them. Natalie began to feel a little nervous about the situation. She had never let anyone do that before, not even herself.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood began to kiss the soft skin of Natalie Harper’s inner thighs and she felt her knees grow weak as he licked the area between her legs. Natalie Harper felt her nerves give way to desire as Trevor Lockwood touched her most intimate areas. She began to think about what he was doing and why, and she felt a little uncomfortable that she was so turned on by it all. Trevor Lock wood found this amusing and continued to lick Natalie Harper’s pussy.<br><br>Natalie Harper was beginning to panic as she thought about what Trevor Lockwood was doing between her legs. He had not even touched her pussy yet and she could already feel the strong sensations emanating from it. It occurred to Natalie that Trevor Lockwood might have done this before and that he might be very good at it. Natalie Harper grew more and more nervous as the minutes passed, but she could only focus on what was happening to her body.<br><br>Natalie Harper felt as if she were going crazy. She wanted to stop what was happening, but  her body told her otherwise. She knew that it was “wrong” to let a stranger do this to her and she knew that she should get up and leave, but something inside of her would not allow her to do so.<br><br>She didn’t hear from Trevor after that, and Natalie began",1
"Natalie Harper makes a deal with Trevor Lockwood, a man she met online, to meet him in person in exchange for money so that she can pay her rent .","Natalie Harper made small talk with Trevor Lockwood online for several months. She was attracted to his confidence and good looks, even though he was nearly twenty years her senior. She saw herself as a confident woman, but she lacked the courage to approach him in public, nor would she do so out of respect for her boyfriend. So Natalie Harper had turned to the internet, where she found Trevor Lockwood. He was interested in meeting her in person, if she had enough money for their date. Natalie Harper agreed and they set up a time and place to meet. Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what kind of man she would date. Natalie Harper said that she would go out with someone like Trevor Lockwood, although he was not much older than her. Natalie Harper asked Trevor Lockwood if he was married. He said he wasn’t and had no children. She asked him if he lived alone, and again, his answer was positive. Natalie Harper met Trevor Lockwood in a coffee shop on the second floor of a shopping center in East Sacramento. She asked him to meet her there, but she did not tell him why. She gave him the agreed-upon amount of money—five hundred dollars—which he assured her would be enough for their date . Trevor Lockwood then gave Natalie Harper an address in rural Northern California and told her to come there. Natalie Harper was aware of Trevor Lockwood’s offer prior to this meeting, but she just needed to talk with him face-to-face to make sure he really meant her no harm. Natalie Harper got  in her car and drove towards the area where Trevor Lockwood told her he lived. She turned off Interstate 80 and drove on the country roads that led into his neighborhood. The roads were isolated, but she had a small map with the directions that Trevor Lockwood had given her. Natalie Harper arrived at his home after driving for about an hour. It was a large house set on a hill, surrounded by forest land. Natalie Harper parked her car on the side of the road and walked up to the front door of the house. She knocked and was immediately greeted by Trevor Lockwood, who opened it with a key he retrieved from inside.  Natalie Harper stepped into the house and greeted Trevor Lockwood.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was wearing a black short-sleeved shirt underneath a red cardigan sweater. His face was clean-shaven, except for a goatee that was trimmed close to his mouth. He had dark brown hair, short at the sides and about two inches long in the back. His eyes were blue and he gave off a strong and commanding presence to those he met. Trevor Lockwood was twenty-four years old and living with his parents in their five-bedroom house. He worked part-time at a small marketing firm in San Francisco, but his income was not very high. Trevor Lockwood invited Natalie Harper to sit down on the couch in his living room.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper how she liked driving up to his house. She said that she had enjoyed the drive, as it was quiet and peaceful. Trevor Lockwood moved to the edge of the couch and cleared a spot for Natalie Harper. Trevor Lockwood moved closer to Natalie Harper and sat down next to her.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood told Natalie Harper that he really enjoyed talking with her online and that he would have much preferred talking with her in person, but circumstances had prevented him from doing so. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand up to Natalie Harper’s shoulder.<br><br>Natalie Harper reached for Trevor Lockwood’s hand and placed it on her thigh. She looked at his lips and then smiled at him as she moved her head closer to his mouth. Trevor Lockwood moved his head away from her.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper if she had thought of any names for the business venture they were discussing. Trevor Lockwood explained that he had already thought of a name, but he was always willing to listen to suggestions from others. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand slowly up the inside of her thigh and moved it towards her crotch.<br><br>Natalie Harper moved Trevor Lockwood’s hand away. She was surprised that Trevor had touched her so soon in their conversation, as they still had so many details to discuss. She told Trevor Lockwood of two possible names that she wanted to consider, and Trevor Lockwood nodded his head.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked if he could move closer to Natalie Harper on the couch. Natalie Harper agreed and Trevor Lockwood moved next to her on the couch.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what she wanted him to do",1

While families have their ups and downs, you cannot avoid each other forever. And sometimes being apart is worse than the fallout from being together.<br><br>Even if you are in the middle of a family feud, here are some reasons to consider if you should turn your back on family:<br><br>Family Longevity<br><br>With an average lifespan of eighty-six years, you will be around a lot of family members during your lifetime.

So why deny yourself the chance to get along again?<br><br>Family Can Help With Kids<br><br>If you don’t have family nearby, who is going to watch your kids? It will be tough to find a babysitter that you trust, especially if they are new to the area.

Family can help watch kids so that you do not have to worry about them.<br><br>Family Can Help In Emergencies<br><br>Not everyone could live their lives in an ideal world. Things happen, and if you don’t have family nearby, you could be in trouble. For example, if a family member gets hit by a car, they may not be able to let you know what happened. You don’t want to wait for someone else to find out about your family member being in the hospital on their own.<br><br>Family Can Be Your Cheerleaders<br><br>If you are working on a big project at work, family can be the best support system.

"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","Jenna Riley stood in the doorway of her family’s blue bungalow, sipping on a cold glass of milk. The air was warm and humid, and Jenna felt heavy in the muggy heat. She had worked the midnight shift at the diner all night long, and it was now four in the morning. Jenna was exhausted from working, and she wished that she could go home to her apartment soon. She passed a few other people on the sidewalk on her way home. They all wore clothes that were too warm for how humid it was outside that early in the morning. Jenna stopped to chat with one of her coworkers. Jenna wished that she worked during the day shift, like him. It would be easier on her body and easier for her to do errands during the day, rather than at night. She would have to wait until after ten thirty before she could go home and rest. She had time for a quick nap  before she had to leave for work again.<br><br>Jenna was carrying a big brown bag of books in one hand and her keys in the other as she walked down the street. She stopped to look at a flyer about a community event. As she was looking through the pages, someone grabbed her shoulder and spun her around behind her. The mugger pressed his hand over her mouth and pulled out a gun.<br><br>“Do anything stupid,” he warned, “and I’ll shoot you in the head and leave you in this alley, just like your friend.”<br><br>He was talking about the poor girl who had been found murdered in the alley behind the diner a few weeks ago. Jenna had often walked through that same alley on her way home from work. She wished that she hadn’t been too tired this morning to walk a different route.<br><br>Jenna tried to scream, but the mugger clamped his hand tighter over her mouth. When he let go of her shoulder, Jenna took advantage and ran for the doors of the library across the street. There were several people inside, working on their laptops or sitting in cozy chairs reading magazines.<br><br>“Help!” Jenna shouted, but the people either looked up from their work or kept reading. No one bothered to come out and help her.<br><br>The mugger ran up to her, grabbed at the bag of books she was holding, and screamed, “Give me your stupid books! Now!”<br><br>Jenna dropped the plastic-wrapped books, but the mugger tripped on his own feet, allowing Jenna to escape. As he stood up, he pulled out a gun and pointed it at Jenna.<br><br>Jenna knew that she couldn’t outrun him.<br><br>“Get over here or I’ll blow your brains out,” the mugger barked.<br><br>Jenna stepped closer to the man, giving him no other choice but to pull the trigger. When a shot rang out, Jenna instinctively ducked and found herself on the ground. It felt like her cheek was burning, but she couldn’t be sure.<br><br>The mugger laughed and knelt down next to her. “You made it easy for me, bitch,” he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette lighter. He looked down at Jenna  and smiled. “When I’m done with you, you won’t be able to walk home from your shift at the diner anymore.”<br><br>The mugger stood up and ignited the lighter. Jenna closed her eyes and felt a sharp pain in her face as the mugger pressed the hot end of the lighter against Jenna’s cheek. She heard a sizzle and when she opened her eyes, she saw the mugger staring at her.<br><br>Jenna sat up and coughed, blood spewing out of her mouth. She looked around and saw the mugger lighting another cigarette;  he was still sitting on the ground next to her. Jenna screamed as loud as she could and lunged forward at the mugger, knocking him off balance. The mugger fell backwards and screamed in pain as he fell onto some broken glass.<br><br>Jenna stood up, but was too weak to get very far. She stumbled to the other side of the alley and collapsed against a wall. She looked down at her hands and saw that they were covered in blood. Her shirt was also stained with blood, and she could feel it slowly seeping into her jeans.<br><br>The mugger got back to his feet and turned around; he was holding the lighter as if preparing for another attack. Jenna’s vision started to go dark, and she stumbled forward, trying to reach the diner. She reached her arms out as if to brace herself against the wall, but all she hit were cold bricks.<br><br>Jenna then felt a sharp sting in her side; she looked down and saw that she was bleeding profusely. She slowly sank to the ground, and began coughing up more blood. The mugger walked out of the alley after he saw that Jenna was lying motionless on the ground. He picked up his sunglasses from the ground and put them back on his face.<br><br>Jenna suddenly came to, and forced herself onto her knees. She heard sirens just outside the alley, and tried to crawl in the direction of the diner’s entrance. It was hard going, but she managed to make it to the door. She was about to use her hands to open it when she realized that her hand was completely covered in blood.<br><br>She then heard a voice, “It’s okay, just lean on me.” When she looked up, Damian Henchman was helping Jenna out behind the diner. Jenna coughed and spat out some blood onto the ground. She began coughing again, and then collapsed on the ground.<br><br>Jenna came to again, and this time, she found herself in a white-walled hospital room with a man in his mid twenties standing at her bedside. Jenna looked up at him, and noticed that he had long blond hair and blue eyes. His face was covered with deep, red scars. He wore a white shirt and pants that were tucked into black combat boots. He was holding Jenna’s hand, and stared back at her.",1

It was like someone was squeezing my head too tight and I could feel the pain in the back of my head.<br><br>	“Nick, are you okay?” she asked with a worried expression on her face.<br><br>	Before I could reply, I felt myself black out.<br><br>	When I woke up, I was lying in my bed and it was dark outside.

But if you don’t get out before dawn, then I will come after you myself and give you a head start of your own – head to my chopping block.”<br><br>John Doe let go of Valerie’s throat and walked over to the steps. He turned around and gave the young woman one last cold look before he went upstairs. <br><br>Valerie looked at the basement steps for a brief moment, hoping that John Doe would come down and finish her off. She saw the cellar door start to open, but it was too late; John Doe had left her alone with the sun just beginning to rise from the horizon.<br><br>Valerie shakily reached underneath her and felt for the door handle. She turned around and ran up the steps, falling over in her haste to get away from the basement. She ran into John Doe’s living room, which was now adorned with blood-stained sheets on the walls and blackened  photographs that once showed his happy family, and she ran into the bedroom where his wife and children used to sleep until they were ripped away by his psychotic hands.<br><br>Valerie saw her chance to escape when John Doe came back into the house – he had gone upstairs to change his bloody clothes – and she took off through the front door, which slammed shut behind her.<br><br>John Doe opened the door, ready to chase after Valerie. He stopped when she ran down the steps of the front porch and disappeared around the corner. She was running straight into oncoming traffic, but John Doe did not care. He only cared about one",1
"Mary Smith complies with John Doe's demands, but when the mugger goes to take her wallet, Mary Smith notices that her hand is shaking and takes this opportunity to run away.",". I knew that he did not have a knife, but I wanted to make a point.<br><br>     “Here is my knife,” he said as he lunged at me again.<br><br>“I told you not to do that,” I said as I jumped out of the way of his attack. He quickly grabbed my arm and began to twist it.<br><br>“If you would have just given me your valuables, then this would have all been over with a long time ago,” he said as he twisted my arm even more.<br><br>I screamed in pain and let go of my knife. “I’m sorry. I just need money to pay for the repair to my water heater,” I cried, trying to get him to loosen his grip.<br><br>“There are better ways of getting money than mugging people,” he said as he tightened his grip on my arm.<br><br>     I tried to get loose from his grasp, but soon my arm began to go numb. He had pulled on it so hard that it had dislocated. I looked at him as tears ran down my face.<br><br>“I’m so sorry. I never meant to hurt you. Please give me your handkerchief so that I can tie up your arm,” he said as he loosened his grip on my arm.<br><br>“Tie up my arm?” I asked him in disbelief.<br><br>     “That way you can still keep your valuables and I won’t have to wait for you to try and run away,” he said as he went to take my handkerchief.<br><br>“You want me to trust you after what you have done?” I asked him.<br><br>“Yes, please let me tie up your arm. If you keep talking to me like that, I am going to dislocate your other arm,” he said as he saw the look of fear in my eyes.<br><br>I reached for my handkerchief and handed it to him. He took it and then wrapped it around my arm. As soon as he finished, he tied it tightly.<br><br>“Now can I have my knife back?” he asked me. “Please don’t make me chase you down. I am tired from all of this running around that I have done today.”<br><br>“I’m sorry. I don’t have your knife,” I said as I pulled my handkerchief off of my arm and gave it to him. He then pulled the knife out of my hand, gave it back to me, and then ran away.<br><br>I put my knife back in my boot and then went to the nearby alley. I sat down and began to think about what had just happened. What had started out as a normal day had turned into one of the worst days that I could remember. Oh, how easy it would have been if I had just given him my wallet and then ran. All of this would have never happened to me.<br><br>     I started to cry as I thought about what this man had done to me.<br><br>I was so glad that he had not been able to take any of my valuables. I had been able to keep everything, including my knife. What if he had taken my knife away? I would have had to run home without any protection. At least now, I could defend myself when I got back home.<br><br>     “I will never let that happen to me again,” I said as I wiped the tears from my eyes. “I will always be armed with my knife and never let anyone get the upper hand on me again.”<br><br>     I looked around the alley and saw a dumpster. I decided that this would be the best place to relieve myself. I then removed my lacy underwear from my skirt, lifted my skirt, and began urinating.<br><br>When I finished urinating, I immediately felt like someone was watching me. When I looked around, I did not see anyone, so I continued on with my walk home.<br><br>I walked the rest of the way home in a daze. It had been a long day and I was exhausted from all of the events that had occurred today. It had started with me losing track of time and falling asleep at the hospital. After that, I had done laundry and had gone to the store to buy some groceries for dinner. After that, I had planned to go to the library, but I had gotten mugged before I could get there.<br><br>     “I’m just glad that it is finally over with,” I thought as I walked up to my front porch.<br><br>I didn’t even realize that I had walked straight into the unlocked door. Now I had walked into the house without locking it.<br><br>     “I’m glad nobody is here to see me walk in like this,” I thought as I walked to the kitchen and sat down.<br><br>I was getting some water when I noticed something on the table. It was an envelope. There was no address on it, so I opened it and began to read the contents.<br><br>     “Dear Mary Smith,<br><br>Please come to the alley behind your house. I have something of yours that you might want to have back,” the letter read.<br><br>I didn’t know who had sent me this letter or why. Whoever it was wanted to make sure that I came to this alley, otherwise they would not have sent this letter.<br><br>     “Who could be behind this?” I thought as I looked around the kitchen.<br><br>I walked over to the table and examined the knife that I had used to cut my vegetables earlier. It was dirty, so I took it and started washing it.<br><br>After washing off the dirt, I noticed how pretty it was. It was made of silver with a gold hilt. I then began to examine some of the other",0
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"like maybe a paragraph explaining what sort of support group this was. I also thought that this might have been a better ending paragraph. I think this was an interesting take on a writing prompt!<br><br>I loved this story. It just pulled me in from the beginning and I had to finish reading it. You kept the story moving well with good descriptions and you introduced the reader to your characters very well.<br><br>The beginning of the story was very powerful and emotional.

Aimee Kincaid goes home after a long day at work only to find her apartment empty and her loneliness amplified by the silence.,"Aimee thought it might be a bad idea. The past few days she had only been able to think about one thing -- the man who had spoken to her at the coffee shop. His words had left an impression on her, and Aimee often found herself wondering about them during the day as she worked at P&P Insurance.<br><br>Aimee Kincaid was a woman in her late thirties. She had been divorced for a few years now, and had since moved out of the family home she had shared with her husband. As a single woman, she was proud of her independence and ability to take care of herself, but lately those feelings had started to change. She felt an emptiness inside that nothing could fill, and she wondered if she would ever feel the passion and love that she had once known.<br><br>She had been seeing men since her divorce, but only a few of them had really gotten to know her. Most of them complained about the fact that she was a bit older than them and didn’t have any kids. She had stopped seeing a few of them because they were just too young for her, and one of them had even tried to pressure her into physical intimacy. Aimee had been very disappointed with that encounter, as she thought he could have at least respected her enough to wait until she wanted it too. She decided to call it quits with that one.<br><br>She had never really been one to go out and meet people. She was perfectly content working, paying her bills, and living a quiet life. Lately, though, she was starting to feel like something was missing from her life. After he spoke to her, Aimee had been unable to get him out of her head. She was sure he was married, but that didn’t stop her from thinking about him. She even daydreamed about walking into the coffee shop and seeing him sitting there again.<br><br>Aimee slowly walked into the store, hoping that he would still be there. It was a small shop, and she was worried that he might have already left. She took her time walking up to the counter, hoping to see him as she did. To her relief, he was still there. He had taken off his jacket, and Aimee could see that his dark brown hair was starting to get slightly longer on top.<br><br>When she reached the counter, they made small talk about the weather. After a few minutes, he looked up at her with a cheeky grin, and said her name.<br><br>“Aimee, right?”<br><br>Aimee blushed a little at his greeting.<br><br>“Yes, I think you might have seen me before.”<br><br>He laughed. “I’m not sure, there are a lot of women in this town.”<br><br>Aimee smiled at his remark. “I’ll take a peppermint tea with honey, please.”<br><br>He smirked and grabbed some tea off the shelf. “Sounds good. What brings you in today?”<br><br>Aimee bit her lip, deciding whether or not to tell him the truth. Just as she was about to talk, the shop door opened and a woman walked in. She was stunning – her dark hair was pulled back into a tight bun, and he could see that her eyes were a striking violet. Her lips were full and sensual, and her figure was amazing in a black pencil skirt and designer blouse. He looked at her and smiled.<br><br>“Oh, hi, I don’t think we have met. I’m Jack,” he said, offering his hand to the woman.<br><br>She smiled, revealing perfect white teeth as she reached up to shake his hand. “Natalie. I work for a magazine, and my boss told me about this place.”<br><br>He raised an eyebrow at her comment. “Really? And who is your boss?”<br><br>Natalie smiled again. “My boss is named Patrick. He’s really nice, you should meet him sometime.”<br><br>He laughed at her comment. “I think I will. So, what brings you into the shop?”<br><br>Natalie sat down at the end of the counter with a sigh. “My boss asked me to interview the owner of this place for a project he’s working on.”<br><br>Jack smiled and nodded. “Well, you’ve come to the right place! I’m Jack, and this is Aimee, she owns the place.”<br><br>Aimee stuck out her hand and smiled at the woman. “Oh, I see. Well it’s nice to meet you.”<br><br>Natalie raised an eyebrow. “I see you two already know each other.”<br><br>Aimee blushed and smiled. “I guess you could say that we’re friends.”<br><br>Natalie smiled at her words, and Jack felt a smile creep on his face.<br><br>“Well, you two have fun with your friendliness! I’m afraid we have to run, Natalie. Thanks for the tea!”<br><br>Natalie nodded and waved goodbye to Aimee and Jack. As soon as they were out of sight, she rolled her eyes at his remark.<br><br>“I can’t believe you just said that! She’s so fucking pretty, and you have no idea how perfect I know she would be for you!”<br><br>Jack rolled his eyes and sat down at the counter. “That’s really not important right now, Nat.”<br><br>“Oh, I think it is very important! You could be dating her by now! I can tell she definitely wants to go out with you!”<br><br>Jack laughed and shook his head. “Do you always have to be so loud, Nat?”",0
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"Anna Cooper entered the office, a middle-aged black woman with a kind face. She wore a white uniform shirt and black pants that fit perfectly, even if her employer, Mrs. Miller, was not a size six. Mrs. Miller was sitting behind the principal’s desk, typing into her computer. A computer Anna Cooper had never seen before and would not have known how to use if it had been offered to her.<br><br>She stood at attention in front of the desk. She was a janitor and she wanted to show respect for her office, but mainly because there was no one else around. Her first day on job she had come early to get a feel for the place, and now she was waiting patiently.<br><br>Anna Cooper did not know if she would enjoy working for Mrs. Miller yet. But at least she had her looks going for her, and that was more than most of the other janitors at the school could say. Anna Cooper realized that she was being hard on herself. She was pretty, but she was also old. Not old in years, but certainly in looks. And she knew that Mrs. Miller thought she looked like a grandmother-type person, which wasn’t a compliment in Anna’s opinion.  But she was almost forty and did not want to look like she was twenty-five. She had been so young when her daughter died.<br><br>Anna Cooper felt that the principal did not even know her name yet, but Anna Cooper knew Mrs. Miller’s and had studied it carefully in case the principal expected to be called by her first name. It was a complicated one, Karen, but Anna was ready for it.<br><br>Finally the door opened and Karen walked into the room. Anna could tell at once that something was bothering her. “Mrs. Miller?” she said as she approached the desk, then  stopped briefly to give the principal more space. “I’m Anna Cooper.”<br><br>Mrs. Miller held out her hand and said quickly, “Please call me Karen. We need to be on first name terms, Anna. So I hear you are an excellent janitor and that you come highly recommended.”<br><br>Anna Cooper knew that the principal was trying to be friendly, but she was feeling off-put by the woman. And she didn’t like to be called Janitor instead of by her title. But she wanted it known that she didn’t take any nonsense from anyone. “I am not a janitor, Mrs. Miller. I have a title and I wish you would use it when addressing me.”<br><br>There was a brief silence after this statement, but then the principal said in an apologetic tone, “Of course you are, Anna. You are the head janitor and that’s what everyone calls you, right?”<br><br>“No! That is not correct. I am the Director of Facilities Management. Please call me by my title, Mrs. Miller. Or Ms Cooper if you prefer to be polite.”<br><br>Karen frowned at this and then said, “Well, I’ll just call you Janitor Cooper. It’s easier that way. Now, I need to know if you have any special talents in cleaning supplies? Do you use a certain kind of mop? How do you like to clean the floors?“<br><br>It was clear that Karen was trying to cover up for her earlier rudeness, but Anna Cooper wasn’t going to let her off the hook. She was offended by the term Janitor and it was also clear that Karen Miller had a problem with following orders. She was already starting to suspect that this would not be a good working relationship.<br><br>However, while this is something that she could work with, there were much more pressing issues. Anna Cooper needed to know what kind of writing was on the chalkboards and whether or not there were any more symbols that matched the one Daniel had shown her.<br><br>“I have no special talents in cleaning supplies,” Anna Cooper said directly. She figured this would get the discussion going again in the right direction.<br><br>“Well, that’s just great! We’re going to have a nice long talk about this ,” Karen Miller snapped.<br><br>“I think that is a bad idea,” Anna Cooper responded, “But it seems to me that you have an agenda and I don’t think it has anything to do with helping me out. So I suggest we end this conversation right here.”<br><br>The principal looked at the janitor for a second and then seemed to deflate. “Okay, but if that symbol shows up again, even on the back of a piece of paper in the trash can, I want to know about it first thing. Do you understand?”<br><br>One of the most obvious aspects of symbolism on the chalkboard is that it includes pictures of crucifixion.<br><br>Crucifixion is an old form of execution in which someone is nailed to a wooden cross. Crucifixion was originally meant as a form of punishment for those who were considered evil or heretics. Crucifixion was widely practiced by the Romans, but became increasingly unpopular in Western Europe.<br><br>Crucifixion was outlawed in some countries during the Middle Ages, but it was still practiced in England until 1853, and remained a legal method of execution in some of the world until very recently. Crucifixion is an extremely unusual method of execution for modern times, and it has been used mostly by people who are considered to be fringe groups or religious extremists.<br><br>Flailing crucifixions is a specific form of crucifixion where the victim is tied and whipped before being nailed to a cross. Flailing crucifixions refers to the violent whipping that usually accompanies crucifixion. Flailing is not an official part of the method of crucifixion, but it does occur often in countries that still practice it. Flailing is typically done with sharp metal rods or other implements, and often includes brutal beatings. The beating takes place while the cross is being raised off of the ground, and flailing is supposed to make the crucifixion more painful. Crucifixions are sometimes depicted in art, including famous works on the subject by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Flailing crucifixions are more common in modern times than flogging deaths, but depictions of both continue to appear in mainstream art.<br><br>Flailing crucifixions have been condemned by many religious leaders over the years. During the Middle Ages, flailing was condemned by Pope Gregory IX, who called it a sacrilegious act.<br><br>Crucifixion is an extreme form of torture,",0
"When Natalie arrives at the address Trevor gave her, she quickly realizes that something isn't right and that Trevor might be a dangerous man .","now that they were in the same room together. Natalie Harper took a sip of her wine and smiled at Trevor Lockwood for a few seconds before answering his question. She told him that she had some ideas and he nodded his head at her.<br><br>Natalie Harper told Trevor Lockwood that she wanted to undress him, and kiss his body as he did the same to her. To add a little more excitement to the situation, she told Trevor Lockwood that they could include some foreplay with their clothes on as well.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was flattered by Natalie Harper’s forward reply and he moved closer to her on the couch. He moved his hand up the inside of Natalie Harper’s thigh and touched her crotch several times before stopping.<br><br>Natalie Harper leaned in to kiss Trevor Lockwood, but he pulled away from her instead. He explained to Natalie Harper that he still had some questions to ask her before moving forward with their plan.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood moved his hand up Natalie Harper’s skirt and he felt her underwear. He moved his fingers back and forth several times before stopping to talk again.<br><br>Natalie Harper was now moving her head back and forth to keep eye contact with Trevor Lockwood. She moved her legs into a more open position so that Trevor Lockwood could have easier access to her panties. She wanted him to move his hand inside of them, but she was going to have to wait a few more minutes before he did.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood moved his other hand up Natalie Harper’s stomach and he gently massaged her breasts through her top. He moved his fingers in a small circular pattern before stopping to talk again.<br><br>There was a small white hotel in the middle of nowhere about an hour from Trevor Lockwood’s small town, a hotel where no one ever went anymore. It would be the perfect place for them to stay in order to get everything they needed done on time.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood moved his hands down from Natalie Harper’s breasts and started unbuttoning her shirt. He pushed the small cotton fabric aside and moved his hands underneath of them to touch her bare breasts.<br><br>Natalie Harper was moving completely out of her comfort zone by agreeing to an in-person meeting with Trevor Lockwood. She was moving further out of it as he moved his hands all over her body, especially when she  could feel his hard cock against her crotch through their clothes.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood touched the soft skin without restraint and Natalie Harper held her breath as he squeezed her large breasts in his hands. He then moved his lips to the area above one of them and kissed the tender skin there.<br><br>Natalie Harper was already feeling turned on by Trevor Lockwood and she knew that when he felt her bare breasts, his arousal would increase. She was a little surprised at how turned on she was herself, considering how nervous she felt as Trevor Lockwood was undressing her. <br><br>Trevor Lockwood parted Natalie Harper’s thighs with his hands as he began to suck on one of her large breasts. After a few seconds, Natalie felt him move closer to her and she knew what was coming next.<br><br>The part of Natalie Harper that was not turned on by this situation was kicking in as Trevor Lockwood spread her legs and buried his face between them. Natalie began to feel a little nervous about the situation. She had never let anyone do that before, not even herself.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood began to kiss the soft skin of Natalie Harper’s inner thighs and she felt her knees grow weak as he licked the area between her legs. Natalie Harper felt her nerves give way to desire as Trevor Lockwood touched her most intimate areas. She began to think about what he was doing and why, and she felt a little uncomfortable that she was so turned on by it all. Trevor Lock wood found this amusing and continued to lick Natalie Harper’s pussy.<br><br>Natalie Harper was beginning to panic as she thought about what Trevor Lockwood was doing between her legs. He had not even touched her pussy yet and she could already feel the strong sensations emanating from it. It occurred to Natalie that Trevor Lockwood might have done this before and that he might be very good at it. Natalie Harper grew more and more nervous as the minutes passed, but she could only focus on what was happening to her body.<br><br>Natalie Harper felt as if she were going crazy. She wanted to stop what was happening, but  her body told her otherwise. She knew that it was “wrong” to let a stranger do this to her and she knew that she should get up and leave, but something inside of her would not allow her to do so.<br><br>She didn’t hear from Trevor after that, and Natalie began",1
"With the help of her new friend, Gary, Shannon comes to understand the harsh realities of life in the inner city and learns that sometimes the truth is much more than just a story.",", but nobody is equal. I don’t see no colored folks running all over the other neighborhoods like they do here, and no one even tries to stop them when they come here and come at us.”<br><br>Shannon had been taught as a child that racism was a thing of the past, but this man’s answer changed her opinion. She had never considered that people of color might feel discriminated against in America. He must be wrong, she thought to herself. No one can possibly think like that anymore.<br><br>“Gary, what happened to your leg?” Shannon said as she looked at Gary’s left leg, which was wrapped in an Ace bandage.<br><br>“Oh, Shannon. You really ain’t from around here, are you? You just ain’t from around here no how. You never been down here to get nothin? Never been down here to meet me and the rest of my boys? We was talkin’ ’bout you yesterday. Gary says you a fine-lookin’ young lady, but we need to see if that is true or not. Get your fine-lookin’ white self over here and meet the rest of Gary’s boys. We gonna see if you is as fine as Gary say you is.”<br><br>Shannon was shocked to hear this talk from a grown man; she had never heard anything like it in her life before. She was surprised by Gary’s reaction, too, and by the way Gary was acting.<br><br>Shannon stood motionless, stunned by what she had just heard. Gary motioned for Shannon to follow him as he headed out of the room. “Follow me,” Gary said with urgency in his voice and led her down the hall. “Meet me and Gary’s boys. Meet Gary. Meet some real men! Real men who fuck hard and take what they wants! Real men who fuck young white women! Meet real men who ain’t afraid to hit a fine-lookin white woman when she is fuckin with them and their business! Meet real men , Shannon. Find out what they all about!”<br><br>Shannon kept pace with Gary as he continued to talk. She followed him out into the street, then up the steps to a porch on one side of a two-story building. “What’s goin on?” Shannon asked Gary as she looked around the porch. There were six or seven young men standing around on the porch; Shannon had seen many of them before but never noticed how handsome they were. Gary was introducing her to them. “Meet my boys, Shannon,” Gary said with pride in his voice. Shannon shook hands with each of the young men. They were all very friendly towards her. They talked and joked with her. Gary then introduced her to a few more young men who came from another part of the neighborhood, and Shannon shook hands with them and shared friendly greetings as well. She became more comfortable as she  got to know these men better; meanwhile, Gary was busy introducing her to more young men who had gathered outside.<br><br>Shannon found herself introduced to one young man after another, each of whom was very nice and polite. Most were wearing jeans and windbreakers or leather jackets; some wore baseball caps or fedoras. Shannon met several young women as well, and she shook hands with all of them. She noticed that most of these young men were black, although at least one was white. Shannon learned that there were two kinds of men in the inner city: “real” guys and “little” guys. Gary was a real guy—he had been to prison and had even shot someone. Shannon learned that one of Gary’s best friends had once been killed by his girlfriend while they were in bed together. Gary told her that this friend was “bad to the bone,” and that the world would be a better place if she learned about the kind of people who lived in the inner city. Gary said he did not have a job, but wanted to get one. Shannon learned that most of the guys on the porch had jobs, but none of them earned more than $9 an hour.  Gary said that most of the gang members she had met earlier were probably unemployed.<br><br>As Shannon and Gary sat chatting, one of the larger men in the group, who was nicknamed “Big Mike,” walked toward them with a bottle of beer in his hand. Gary stood up and introduced Shannon to Big Mike. Shannon shook hands with him.<br><br>“I’m Shannon Doyle,” she said. “I work for the Tribune. I have come here today to learn about your world. Gary Saunders told me I ought to meet you all.” Shannon introduced Gary as her friend, and he nodded.<br><br>Gary introduced Shannon to the rest of the group, including a teenage boy who was nicknamed “Little Mike.” Little Mike was white and about 5 feet 8 inches tall. He looked more like a 14-year-old than an 18-year -old.<br><br>Gary put out his hand for Shannon to shake, and she did the same for Little Mike, but he just stared at her with his mouth hanging open.<br><br>Big Mike handed Shannon and Gary each a beer, but only Shannon accepted it. Gary didn’t drink alcohol at all.<br><br>Shannon asked Gary how long he had lived in the inner city.<br><br>“For a long time,” Gary said. “I was born here. My parents were immigrants from Ireland, and they lived here for a long time too before they moved back to Ireland when I was 10 or 11 years old.”<br><br>Shannon learned that Gary was 18 years old and that he had never been employed in his life. His parents had died when he was 8 years old, and it fell to an aunt to raise him. He had dropped out of high school two years earlier because of being bullied at  school for the clothes he wore and for the fact that he wasn’t interested in sports.<br><br>“I didn’t want to wear the latest sneakers or hats that everyone at school was wearing, and I couldn’t care less about who wins a game of soccer or hockey. I just didn’t fit in, Shannon.”<br><br>“Didn’t you ever tell your parents about the bullying?”<br><br>“No way, Shannon! I wasn’t going to admit to my parents that I was being bullied at school. They would have wanted to come down here to talk personally with the principal and the bullies and try to work out a solution. It also wouldn’t have been helpful in anyway. It simply didn’t occur to me then that telling my parents everything that was happening was the right thing to do.” Shannon noticed that Gary’s voice trailed off into silence.<br><br>“Tell me something else about yourself, Gary, and tell me the truth this time. Why is it so important for you to tell me the truth? Why do you want to be honest? You know that I want to be a journalist. Truth is more than just a word. It’s everything around you and everything you accept as true. Everything that is true is important, and it always has been. Even stories have some truth in them, or are based on something real from the past or present. But stories aren’t real, they are just someone else’s perception of the truth. The truth is what actually happened, or what is happening. Sometimes people don’t want to believe the truth because it’s too hard for them to accept. I want to know the truth about you and this place, Gary. Please, tell me the truth.” Shannon looked at Gary with pleading eyes.<br><br>Gary took a deep breath and began to speak. “I wanted to be honest with you because I thought you could help me, and because I thought you were different from all the other people who have come down here. Everyone always asks the same questions and they never really listen to the answers. I can tell that you’re different, Shannon. You actually seem like you care.”<br><br>Shannon nodded her head in understanding. “I do care, Gary. I want to help you if I can.",1
Jenna Adams meets Brian Johnson and immediately feels drawn to him.,"Jenna Adams felt a brief and strong panic when she saw Brian Johnson in the parking lot. She had been working at the local library for two years, and she would have expected to have seen him there before. He was three years older than her, in his early thirties, with a boyish charm. He was tall, lean and looked as if he had just walked off the cover of GQ. She wondered if he had been a model at one point in his life.<br><br>The first time Jenna saw him she stopped short in the middle of the aisle between bookshelves and looked up at him, her heart beating faster. Brian Johnson was standing in front of the window looking out into the parking lot, but she could tell that he hadn’t seen her yet.<br><br>Jenna Adams came to a stop beside Brian Johnson and looked at him with wide eyes.<br><br>Brian Johnson turned around and smiled at her, flashing perfect white teeth in Jenna Adams’s face.<br><br>Jenna Adams met Brian Johnson several times after that, but she found herself longing for an invitation to lunch or a cup of coffee just the two of them. She wanted to get to know him better, but they were only casual acquaintances. They had met  in such a chance encounter that Jenna Adams was unsure how to approach him about going out together.<br><br>They did spend time together at the library when she was on break, as he worked part-time at the public library as well. They discussed books and movies and, on one occasion, talked about their families. <br><br>But Jenna Adams wouldn’t allow herself to become too emotionally involved in her relationship with Brian Johnson because she didn’t want to get her hopes up. Jenna Adams had been in love many times before, and no matter how hard she tried to warn herself not to give her heart away too soon, the inevitable happened every single time. Jenna Adams fell madly in love with every person she dated, but they all broke up with her before the first month was over.<br><br>Brian Johnson was different from the other men she had known. He seemed to be genuinely interested in her. But Jenna Adams was careful not to  get her hopes up. She also avoided socializing with Brian Johnson whenever Mary Smith was around, knowing full well that if she ever introduced them, the romance would be over.<br><br>Despite her efforts to maintain a casual relationship with Brian Johnson by only spending time together when Mary Smith was away, Jenna Adams found herself wanting  more. The longer they spent time together, the more Jenna Adams wanted their relationship to go somewhere. On Fridays and Saturdays, especially, she became so excited when she saw Brian Johnson walking down the street or in other public places that she almost ran to catch up with him.<br><br>Jenna Adams felt as though there was something very special between the two of them, and she began to feel more and more hopeful about their future together. She liked Brian Johnson and thought they had a lot in common, but then again, she thought that about all of her ex-boyfriends. Jenna Adams was growing more and more infatuated with Brian Johnson, and she thought that perhaps this was what real love felt like. Maybe marriage wasn’t so bad after all.<br><br>Nevertheless, Brian Johnson’s mother, Mary Smith, disapproved of Jenna Adams and did everything she could to break them up",1
"Shannon lands her first major assignment, a feature on the inner city, but quickly discovers that the ugly reality of life in the city is far different from the dream she imagined.","the photos, and she knew Lisa was right: they only made her loss more painful.<br><br>	She walked among the people on the streets, and watched the cars race by.  It was like everyone else had a life that was going somewhere, but she felt like she was just standing there watching it all happen.<br><br>	That’s when she saw him. The boy from the photo, with the old professor who had found the box on the subway. They were walking along the street, laughing and joking with each other as they went along. They didn’t seem to notice her as she approached, but when she was within a few feet of them, she heard them talking and stopped.<br><br>	“I told you I wasn’t going to do it,” the boy said.<br><br>	“You said that the other times, too, but you still did it. What makes this time different?”<br><br>	“Because I said so!” he said with a laugh, as he ran in front of the old professor and began to chase him.<br><br>	The old man began to run down the street, trying to put some distance between himself and his young pursuer. The boy ran in front of cars, dodged around people, and pushed past others in an effort to catch him.<br><br>	As the boy ran, Shannon saw him from a different perspective. She looked beyond the dirty clothes and the unkempt hair to see his face, and she saw a boy who was full of life and laughter. She saw a boy who was always smiling and always joking with others, but it was obvious that it wasn’t because he didn’t care. It was because he cared too much, and he was afraid of losing those he loved.<br><br>	The boy caught up to the old man, who was now walking briskly down the street.  The boy ran to his side and grabbed his arm, pulling him to stop.<br><br>	“I heard what you said, but that doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter how many times I do it as long as I don’t do it again. And I won’t.”<br><br>	The boy smiled at the man, and the two of them began to walk along the street together. Shannon felt a wave of relief go through her as she watched them go, and she had finally realized what was missing from her life. She turned to leave the street and headed back to the city to begin her story.<br><br>	Shannon went home and decided to take a nap before she began to work on her story. She needed a rest, but she didn’t turn off the light. She looked through the large window of her apartment to watch the people hurrying along the street below. They seemed to be in such a hurry, but they all had somewhere to go, someone they were trying to reach. She sat on the couch and pulled the box of photos out, looking through them again as she thought about what people did with their lives.<br><br>	Shannon had always been fascinated by the stories presented in the newspaper and on the news programs. When she was a child, she wanted to be a journalist so that she could tell those stories herself. She loved the power they had over people, how they could change lives and open people’s eyes to the world around them. People might not believe every word they saw, but at least they had the power to make a difference in the world. She could make a difference, too. She wanted to see things that other people didn’t see.<br><br>	She flipped through the album and stopped to look at a picture of two boys sitting on a stoop, smiling for the camera. It was a sunny day, and one of the boys had his arm around the other, as though he was keeping him warm. The picture made Shannon feel warm inside, and she smiled as she thought to herself that no one could tell them that they had no future; not with a picture like that.<br><br>	Shannon closed the photos and pulled out her laptop to begin her story. She wanted to capture the life and spirit of the people of the inner city, but first she needed to learn about them. She needed to talk to them and gain their trust, so that they would be willing to share with her. That was something she couldn’t do by herself.<br><br>	As she started to type, Shannon thought about all the people she would have to talk to in order to conduct this interview. She needed to speak with the people at the shelter, where the children lived. She needed to speak with the people in the neighborhood who knew her subjects and who knew their stories. She needed to speak with the teachers who taught them and their parents who loved them…and, for some of them, who had lost them.<br><br>	“Mom? Mom!” Shannon’s mom came running into the living room. “You have to come and see this! There’s a news van out front.”<br><br>	Shannon stood, pulling herself out of her thoughts. “Really? Do you think it’s about me?”<br><br>	Her mother shook her head. “Probably not. But I thought you would want to know, in case they wanted to interview you.”<br><br>	“I would,” Shannon agreed. She hopped off the couch and followed her mother to the front window of their apartment. She could see a small news van parked on the street, and she watched as people around her ran to their front doors to see what was going on.<br><br>	“I don’t think they would be here for me though,” Shannon said. “It’s probably just a celebrity or something.”<br><br>	Her mother nodded. “But you never know,” she said. “It could be a story about the kids in the shelter or something like that – it would be great publicity for them.”<br><br>	Shannon thought back to her photo album and the picture of the two boys",0
"Melissa Jones, a witness to the robbery, calls the police and John Doe is apprehended and arrested.","knives that I had in the knife block. They were all nice knives, but none of them were as nice as the one that I was currently holding.<br><br>     “I guess that I should go and look for whoever has my knife,” I thought as I put the cleaning cloth back in the drawer and walked into the living room.<br><br>I then walked into my bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to look my best, so I put on a pair of blue jeans and a pink spaghetti tank top. I decided to leave my make-up off and put my hair in a ponytail.<br><br>     “I am not going to go out looking like I do on a normal basis,” I said as I walked out of the house.<br><br>I didn’t know that I was being watched. After a few minutes of walking, I saw someone standing in the alley. When I approached him, he said, “I told you that you would be coming here.”<br><br>     “Who are you?” I asked as I walked closer to him.<br><br>     “I am only an innocent man trying to get his knife back,” he said as he took a step back.<br><br>     “Why do you want your knife back so badly?” I asked as I took another step closer to him.<br><br>     “I have had that knife for many years now and it has been my favorite possession. I was using it today when you walked in and stole it,” he replied.<br><br>I then looked down at the knife in my hands. It was indeed the knife that he had in his hand.<br><br>     “I didn’t steal your knife,” I said as I dropped it to the ground.<br><br>He quickly picked it back up and said, “You stole it and I want it back.”<br><br>     “I think someone is playing a cruel trick on me, because I never stole that knife,” I said as I looked at him.<br><br>He didn’t look like the type of person to play games with other people. He was tall and athletic with dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. He was almost like looking at myself in the mirror, but he was taller and had bigger muscles.<br><br>“When is someone ever going to be honest with me?” I thought.<br><br>I still had my knife and he was still watching me very closely. He may have been tall and athletic, but he was no match for me. I was taller than him and stronger than him.<br><br>     “I am not afraid of you. I am going to call the police and have them take you into custody, unless you give me back what you took from me,” I said as I walked away from him.<br><br>He quickly grabbed me and pushed me against the brick wall.<br><br>     “You are not in a position to call the police,” he said as he raised the knife up to my face.<br><br>I suddenly realized that I was in danger and couldn’t just let him get the knife back. I tried to kick him as hard as I could, but he just moved back away from the attack.<br><br>     “What are you doing?” he asked, with a puzzled look on his face.<br><br>I didn’t understand what he was doing, but I knew that it wasn’t good. He then began to run toward me and jumped on me. As we were struggling, the blade of the knife cut my neck. I was bleeding uncontrollably. It only took a few seconds to realize that I was going to lose this fight.<br><br>     “What are you doing?” I asked as he began to stab me again and again.<br><br>By the time I was losing consciousness, I saw the woman that had stolen my wallet running away.<br><br>The End</s>U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.

Julia Martin starts to experience terrifying visions.,"Julia Martin lay in her bed. She was trying to calm down and slow her breathing. The images in her head were becoming clearer and clearer. She could see the townspeople as they walked about in their normal routine, going about their business. They looked pretty normal, but they were missing something that Julia couldn’t put her finger on, but she knew that she would know it when she saw.<br><br>She could see people walking by the grocery store, and suddenly a strange aura appeared around the door of the store. The aura was a very bright white light, and Julia found herself feeling afraid for no apparent reason. Julia started to feel a sense of dread, and she didn’t understand why. Her eyes started to tear up, and a lump formed in her throat. She felt scared, and she felt like she had to run away. She ran as fast as she could away from the grocery store, but  still she felt like something was coming after her.<br><br>The light from the grocery store seemed to follow Julia wherever she ran, always remaining just out of reach. The townspeople now seemed to be changing in Julia’s vision. She could see that they had begun a process of degeneration. The people around her were becoming more and more strange.<br><br>They were losing their bodies, and now they were nothing but gray masses, moving about the streets in a ghostly fashion. No longer did they have any discernible faces or bodies; all that she could see was a mass of moving gray clouds. They moved among the stores like a cloud of smoke, occasionally forming into a face or an animal and then dissipating again.<br><br>They seemed to be looking straight at Julia, but she couldn’t quite tell if they were even aware of her. They were moving in a very strange manner, with no apparent destination in mind. They glided from the streets into people’s homes and back again, making no sense whatsoever. Now the townspeople were trying to enter her own home.<br><br>As soon as they entered, they vanished, leaving behind only gray ash on the floor. She tried to close her eyes so that she might not be forced to look upon these bizarre ghosts, but she found that she was unable to.<br><br>She opened them again, and found herself staring at the entrance to her own home. In front of her was a young man with no face or body, who seemed to be holding an arm outstretched towards her. It was as if he were beckoning her to follow him, but there was nothing she could do. She had no legs with which to move, only a cloud of moving gray ash. Still, it appeared that whatever he was beckoning her to follow him into had a definite destination in mind; it wasn’t just wandering aimlessly through people’s homes.<br><br>More and more of these silhouettes started to appear before her. For some reason she did not question this occurrence; it was as if she had come to accept the fact that these ghosts would be coming into her house. They entered from every  side, and though they had no feet they were able to make their way through the floor as if it were water. They seemed to want not only to enter her house, but also to remain inside.<br><br>She could see them clearly now, because they had all taken on the gray color of her home. She saw that they were all people she knew in one form or another, and many of them had faces that had been torn apart or sliced off, a terrible sight. They didn’t seem to be aware of that, though; they simply stood there waiting for her to follow them into her home. She knew that she had to do it.<br><br>She was led into the living room, and saw that her house had been invaded by these gray silhouettes. At first she thought that they were looking at her, but then realized that they were all looking past her towards a house at the end of the street where a woman lived with her two children. The silhouettes were coming forward in a line, and they began to move towards the woman’s house.<br><br>Thelma Bates was now standing in front of Julia, and she was pointing to the house down the street. She could see the silhouette of Thelma become more distinct in the gray cloud that surrounded them both.<br><br>“That’s where it all starts to go awry. That’s where it begins, and then before you know it, the visions are everywhere. Each one more terrible than the last.” <br><br>Thelma began to walk down the street towards the woman with her two children. Julia wanted to go and warn her, but she was unable to move from where she was standing. She tried to call out, but could not force any sounds out of her mouth. She could see Thelma walking slowly down the street with the other silhouettes in her wake. When Thelma reached the woman’s house, she gestured for Julia to follow her. This time, Julia was able to make sounds, and she began to yell at Thelma, “What are you doing?”<br><br>“We have to show them what’s going on. We can’t let them enter that house without knowing what they are getting into,” Thelma said as she turned to Julia.<br><br>Julia continued to yell, “But they will get hurt! And so will you!”<br><br>As much as Julia wanted to stop what was happening, she could not muster up the strength to move. She tried again to yell and move her body, but both were still impossible. She heard a door open and then the sound of footsteps on the floor of the house. The figure of the woman appeared at the window and began to stare at Julia and Thelma. She stared with such fright that it frightened Julia even more.<br><br>The figure of the woman slowly turned away from the window, but she did not enter the room. Instead, she raised her hand and began to hit herself in the face over and over again.<br><br>Julia tried to yell louder, but she was still entirely incapable of moving. She was glad that Tim was in the house with them, but he was too far away for her to call out loud enough for him to hear. She wanted to scream so that he would help her, but she was mute. Thelma had jumped back and was waving to get Tim’s attention, but he did not seem to notice.<br><br>Finally, Julia made the effort to step forward even though it hurt and pulled Thelma with her. She called out to Tim and finally he turned around. It looked like Thelma was holding his left arm and Julia was holding his right. He stopped and stared at them, unable to believe what they were doing.<br><br>“Don’t come in here!” Thelma yelled at him",1

It isn’t safe with too many people around.”<br><br>	“Yeah, I guess you’re right.” He said, looking down at the ground for a few seconds and then looking up at me. “What do you think about our chances? Do you think we’ll ever make it out of here?” he asked me, looking around the garage.<br><br>	“I don’t know, Michael. I guess we’ll just have to wait and find out.” I said, looking around for anything I could use.<br><br>	“Well, let’s just hope we do…” he said, looking over at me and smiling a little. “I mean… How long do you think this place is going to last?

I could hear the girl whimper just before I turned the corner again, but when I turned around, she was gone.

The world ends in a cataclysmic event.,"One day, the world just ended.<br><br>    The sky turned red and the ground shook. Everyone knew it was the end for all of them. The lights went out, the electricity left, along with the running water and all other necessities that people took for granted. The world ended.<br><br>And then it started again. A flash of green light and a brilliant white sound filled the sky as if the world was being zapped clean. And then it happened again. And again.<br><br>And suddenly, everything was ok again in the world, but darker than before. Some said that heaven came to earth and wiped the world clean, and that everything would be fine from now on. But that didn’t really explain why there was so much darkness afterwards. Why it seemed darker than before. Why the world seemed smaller somehow, like a smaller version of itself. Why people kept seeing ghosts everywhere and zombies, and demons and all kinds of creatures that should have died in the cataclysm that had just happened.<br><br>The world was ending again, but this time for real. The blackness in the world was spreading. Soon everything would be gone forever. The end of the world had come for real this time .<br><br>The sun gave way to the blackness, and in the middle of it all, was a huge ring of light that shone brightly from all over the earth. It came out of nowhere, and there was no explanation for it whatsoever. But everyone knew what it was. And they knew it meant the end of the world was finally here.<br><br>As the sky got darker, and then darker still, and the ring of light turned into a circle of light that seemed to emanate from the ground beneath them, darkness finally fell over everything. All of nature went silent. The birds stopped singing, grass stopped growing, flowers stopped blooming, trees stopped leafing. Rivers and streams dried up.<br><br>And then the sky turned red.<br><br>The whole sky turned red, like the color of blood. And the ground shook violently beneath them as all of nature was overcome with a terrible heat that seemed to come from below their feet.  So people ran away in terror, everyone trying to get as far away from each other as possible. Everyone ran for their own lives as fast as they possibly could, not knowing what would happen next, nor where they would run to. They just knew they had to get away from others as fast as possible before the end came upon them.<br><br>The people were in such a terrible state of panic and confusion, that when Maria Martinez tried to ask the others what was going on, no one paid any attention to her. All they could think of was getting away from everyone else and somewhere safe, and so they all ignored her. Maria  ran around in circles for a while trying to figure out what was happening and where to go, but it was hopeless.<br><br>“I don’t know what to do! What should I do?” she cried out desperately into the night air as she ran around in circles on the plaza. The sun disappeared behind a wall of flames that burned its way across the horizon like a fiery river and plunged the world into darkness. It was now pitch black and eerie shadows danced all around as if some otherworldly creatures were playing tricks on them.<br><br>Maria felt so frightened that she was shaking uncontrollably, but she  didn’t have much time to think, because the ground started to crumble and buildings collapsed as the earth shook violently beneath their feet. Everyone began screaming and trying to run away as fast as they could, not knowing what was causing this, or where to go.  Maria could hear the sound of glass breaking and the distant, terrified screams of her neighbors as she ran through the streets just like everyone else.<br><br>Maria looked up at the night sky and saw a bright light shining down from it. It spread its beams out across the landscape like a million tiny spotlights, illuminating everything in sight. Everything looked different now, as if it was lit up by some weird light that didn’t belong there. Suddenly, the sky went dark again and it seemed as if a hole had opened in the Earth from which they could see far below them. The moon disappeared and the stars vanished from the sky, plunging the world into darkness. Then the ground fractured and an enormous crack spread from horizon to horizon, swallowing up everything in its path.<br><br>The sky faded to red as fire engulfed the world. Finally, the light faded and everything went silent once more. Then a blinding flash of white fire burst forth, engulfing the sky.<br><br>The ground crumbled and opened up, swallowing up not only the sky but everything in sight. Trees, buildings, cars; all disappeared like dust in a rainstorm. Everything except for one lone building which stood unharmed at the center of all this chaos; untouched by the chaos  that engulfed everything else.<br><br>Cars and bodies flew through the air like dust in the wind. When they landed, they scattered across the land like seeds from a bomb blast. The people who had once lived and worked there were forced to watch their homes, their friends and family die before their eyes; right before they were swallowed up by the ground below.<br><br>The ground crumbled and split apart as if it too was dying. Then, with a loud crash and a thunderous roar, everything stopped. The land fell silent again, as if nothing had ever happened at all. In the distant void of space, where the ground had shattered, a dark figure was standing on top of a stone pillar. It raised up its massive black arm, opening its mouth and sending out a beam of white fire that shot into the sky. Its mouth opened wider as it swallowed the whole world …<br><br>… and nothing else was left.",1

There were reports that McIntyre vs. Lashley was going to be a part of the card for WrestleMania, but the WWE decided to have it as the final match on night one.<br><br>And now, your moment of zen. pic.twitter.com/z9t1g5u6Qh — WWE (@WWE) February 6, 2021<br><br>The other featured match in the card is Rhea Ripley defending her Raw Women’s Championship against Asuka. “The Empress of Tomorrow” has been one of the top women in WWE for a long time and recently broke the record for days with the title. However, Ripley has always been an important part of WWE programming and finally got her big moment last year. She won the title at WrestleMania 36 after Charlotte Flair was unable to perform due to COVID-19.<br><br>WrestleMania 37 will be available for streaming on NBC’s Peacock platform, but it won’t be free. Fans can purchase WrestleMania or get a subscription to Peacock Premium. The cost of the event will also get fans a free month of Peacock Premium.<br><br>The WWE Network previously offered a free week back in November, but that was part of the promotional campaign for the Survivor Series. The first night of that event featured several NXT stars in a five-team tag team match. It was a way for each brand to showcase a top star from NXT. So far, there doesn’t seem to be any such match on the WrestleMania card, but there is always the opportunity of a surprise.<br><br>Additionally, this WrestleMania will be the first to be done in front of a live crowd since the pandemic began. The event will also have fans in attendance for all three nights. Only about 25,000 total fans will be able to watch the event in attendance. It will be the largest event since March of last year and the first time that the WWE has held an event at Raymond James Stadium.</s>The amount of people here saying she deserved it because she was Muslim is pretty fucking disgusting.

Jenna Adams meets Brian Johnson and immediately feels drawn to him.,"Jenna Adams felt a brief and strong panic when she saw Brian Johnson in the parking lot. She had been working at the local library for two years, and she would have expected to have seen him there before. He was three years older than her, in his early thirties, with a boyish charm. He was tall, lean and looked as if he had just walked off the cover of GQ. She wondered if he had been a model at one point in his life.<br><br>The first time Jenna saw him she stopped short in the middle of the aisle between bookshelves and looked up at him, her heart beating faster. Brian Johnson was standing in front of the window looking out into the parking lot, but she could tell that he hadn’t seen her yet.<br><br>Jenna Adams came to a stop beside Brian Johnson and looked at him with wide eyes.<br><br>Brian Johnson turned around and smiled at her, flashing perfect white teeth in Jenna Adams’s face.<br><br>Jenna Adams met Brian Johnson several times after that, but she found herself longing for an invitation to lunch or a cup of coffee just the two of them. She wanted to get to know him better, but they were only casual acquaintances. They had met  in such a chance encounter that Jenna Adams was unsure how to approach him about going out together.<br><br>They did spend time together at the library when she was on break, as he worked part-time at the public library as well. They discussed books and movies and, on one occasion, talked about their families. <br><br>But Jenna Adams wouldn’t allow herself to become too emotionally involved in her relationship with Brian Johnson because she didn’t want to get her hopes up. Jenna Adams had been in love many times before, and no matter how hard she tried to warn herself not to give her heart away too soon, the inevitable happened every single time. Jenna Adams fell madly in love with every person she dated, but they all broke up with her before the first month was over.<br><br>Brian Johnson was different from the other men she had known. He seemed to be genuinely interested in her. But Jenna Adams was careful not to  get her hopes up. She also avoided socializing with Brian Johnson whenever Mary Smith was around, knowing full well that if she ever introduced them, the romance would be over.<br><br>Despite her efforts to maintain a casual relationship with Brian Johnson by only spending time together when Mary Smith was away, Jenna Adams found herself wanting  more. The longer they spent time together, the more Jenna Adams wanted their relationship to go somewhere. On Fridays and Saturdays, especially, she became so excited when she saw Brian Johnson walking down the street or in other public places that she almost ran to catch up with him.<br><br>Jenna Adams felt as though there was something very special between the two of them, and she began to feel more and more hopeful about their future together. She liked Brian Johnson and thought they had a lot in common, but then again, she thought that about all of her ex-boyfriends. Jenna Adams was growing more and more infatuated with Brian Johnson, and she thought that perhaps this was what real love felt like. Maybe marriage wasn’t so bad after all.<br><br>Nevertheless, Brian Johnson’s mother, Mary Smith, disapproved of Jenna Adams and did everything she could to break them up",1
Paula meets Sally in college and the two become best friends.,"The woman sat at the computer, staring at the blank screen in front of her. She couldn’t remember what she was supposed to be writing, only that she was supposed to be writing something.<br><br>She tried her best to focus on the words and phrases, but they moved like water. The more she tried to look at them, the more they blurred.<br><br>The woman placed her hands on the keyboard. She tried her best to remember the story in her head, but all she could remember was her friend’s tearful face and the softness of Sally’s hand as she squeezed it one last time.<br><br>The woman typed a few words about how Sally met her husband, but it was like trying to push through a mudslide. No matter what good intentions she had, no matter how hard she tried to move forward, she just couldn’t make any progress.<br><br>The woman closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She knew that she was having a hard time because she had been crying, but that wasn’t the only reason.<br><br>She just needed to get started. She knew that if she kept telling herself that, she would begin to write, and the words would just come to her.<br><br>The woman typed, “Sally didn’t like her new life, but she didn’t know what to do.”<br><br>She stopped typing. She didn’t want to write about Sally not liking her new life. That was too sad. She wanted to write a happy story about Sally and her husband.<br><br>She tried so hard to push the sad feelings aside, but they wouldn’t go away. She couldn’t think about the happy things when her life had been turned upside down.<br><br>The woman pushed everything from her mind except for the thoughts of Sally. She focused on how much she loved her friend. She thought about how nice Sally had been to her when she was a freshman in college, and how Sally always made her feel better when she was feeling blue.<br><br>She typed, “Sally was always kind to the freshmen girls, but they annoyed her.”<br><br>She typed a few more words about Sally’s life back then, but even though she was writing what she wanted to write, the words didn’t seem to flow well.<br><br>The woman bit her lower lip. “Maybe I should try to write more slowly,” she thought.<br><br>She took a moment to really think about what she wanted to write. She wanted to write about Sally and her husband, but she didn’t want it to be overly sad. She didn’t think that the story was going to be sad if she wrote about Sally meeting her husband.<br><br>She typed a few more words about how Sally met her husband, but it still didn’t sound right. The woman thought about what she read in the newspaper and thought she might want to write about that.<br><br>The woman stopped typing and closed her eyes. “I’ll start with what they found in the house,” she thought.<br><br>She thought about her best friend and what a happy person she was. Sally was always smiling, and she made everyone else smile too. She thought that maybe a story about a happy person finding love in life would be a nice tribute to her friend.<br><br>It felt good to be writing again, but it also felt like something was missing.<br><br>The woman took another deep breath and opened her eyes. “I think I know what’s missing,” she thought. “I need to think of a happy memory from back when Sally and I met.”<br><br>She knew that she was her best friend’s maid of honor, but she didn’t remember what day it was. She thought about what she wore for the ceremony, but that didn’t help her. She thought about the flowers that they picked out for the wedding, and how Sally always loved bright colors. She thought about how in love the two of them had been, but she still couldn’t remember the date of the wedding.<br><br>The woman bit her lower lip and tried to concentrate. She tried so hard to think of a happy memory, but she couldn’t remember anything special about their friendship. She remembered how much she missed her best friend, but she couldn’t think of one thing from their friendship that caused her to miss Sally so much.<br><br>The woman pushed all of her feelings aside and focused on the story. She focused on Sally finding love and marrying her husband. She typed a few words about how Sally met her husband, but they still didn’t sound right.<br><br>She paused again and searched her memory. She was going to write about Sally meeting her husband, but she didn’t want the story to be a complete tear-jerker. If she wanted to write a happy story about her friend, she would have to write about Sally’s husband and how wonderful he was.<br><br>The woman pressed her lips together for a moment. “A happy story about Sally and her husband wouldn’t be complete without talking about their two-year-old daughter,” she thought. “I’ll have to think of a way to tie everything together.”<br><br>The woman typed a few more words about what the police found in the house, but it still didn’t sound like it fit. She still didn’t know what the ending should be.<br><br>She paused again and thought about what kind of story she wanted to write. She knew that she was going to write about Sally’s death, but she wondered if it would be a sad ending or a happy ending.<br><br>Paula closed her eyes and thought about the kind of ending that she wanted for her story. She thought about the happy times that she shared with her best friend and started thinking about how she wanted to end the story. She felt like she had a good idea, and she",1
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.",". “You are not a bad girl!” he barked in an excited voice.<br><br>Then the little dog suddenly stopped wagging his tail and looked at Kitty very seriously. He stared at her for a moment, then said “I don’t understand why somebody would yell at you for being a bad girl when you’re not—can I help you? Can I be of any assistance to you in any way?”<br><br>Kitty did not know what to say. She began staring at the ground, not sure what to do next.<br><br>Lulu Laverne stared at Kitty for a long moment. Then he nodded his head and smiled again. “I see that you have a problem,” he said in an understanding voice. “In fact, I think I can help you solve it!”<br><br>Kitty stared at the little dog. He was so kind and friendly that she almost forgot about the other men shouting at her.<br><br>“What is your name?” Kitty finally asked, still staring at the ground.<br><br>Lulu Laverne’s tail started wagging again, and his little ears perked up. “My name is Lulu Laverne,” he said in a friendly voice. Kitty looked up at him and smiled. It was nice to see that a dog could be so friendly, especially when some people were being so cruel to her. “And what is your name?”<br><br>Kitty hesitated a moment before answering. She still did not know if Sergei was still watching her and listening, but she realized that the kind little dog seemed to genuinely care about her. She began looking up at him again and said, “My name is Kitty Pawsky. I’m a private detective who moved here from the city because I like country life. But now there are some big problems here in the park, and I think it would be good if we all worked together on it. Do you think we can do that?”<br><br>Lulu Laverne stopped moving for a moment, and his happy face slowly began to turn a little more serious. “I see you moving your tail,” Kitty said gently. “Is there something wrong? Do you not want to talk about it?” <br><br>Lulu Laverne turned his head away from her. “It’s okay,” he muttered in a quiet voice. “I just have one friend here in the park who likes to tease me sometimes. He leaves catnip mice and feathers all over my house so that I’ll get into trouble when the other dogs see them. Sometimes he even comes inside on of the houses and scares me while I’m sleeping, but then he always leaves a treat for me by my bed, so it’s okay.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “So your friend is the one who does these bad things?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne shook his head. “No, he doesn’t do it! He just likes to watch me get into trouble.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “Then it sounds like he’s the one who is doing these bad things, since you keep getting into trouble,” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne sighed. “I told him to stop a long time ago, but he won’t listen,” he said. “And now I have to go in this house and do my homework…”<br><br>Kitty frowned. She knew that this was a bad thing that this friend was doing to Lulu Laverne, but she wasn’t exactly sure how to help him.<br><br>“Why doesn’t your friend listen to you?” she asked.<br><br>Lulu Laverne sighed again and shook his head. “I don’t know, he just doesn’t like to be told what to do, I guess.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “But you are his friend, and he must care about you a lot, right?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne smiled. “Yeah, he does care about me a lot,” he said. “You know, I’m starting to think that maybe I’ll just go into the house and tell my parents about it so they can help me.”<br><br>Kitty smiled as well. “That sounds like a good idea,” she said. Then, after a moment, she continued . “Do your homework first though, okay?”<br><br>Lulu Laverne laughed. “All right, I’ll do that first!” he said. He started walking off through the park as Kitty called after him.<br><br>“Lulu, stay safe, okay?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne stopped and turned around to look at her. She smiled again. “I will, Kitty, I will!” he said. He continued walking towards his house as Kitty watched him go. She turned her gaze back to the park.<br><br>She saw that Sergei was heading for the swing set. The dogs were looking at him as he approached them. Kitty didn’t understand it, but she was glad that the dogs had someone to play with besides just each other and her; it’s much better when there are more people around to make everything a little more fun.<br><br>Kitty moved towards the swing set, ready to go off on another adventure into the dog park and try to figure out what was going on. She had followed Sergei to where he always seemed to go, and now she would work her way through the park and see what sort of clues she could discover.<br><br>There was something going on here, Kitty was sure of it. She moved closer to the swing set. The park was quiet. Nothing moved except for the trees and the leaves on them. Kitty moved towards the slide near the swings and moved in a position where she could see both of the swings.<br><br>She was moving closer to the swing set when she saw it – a catnip mouse. On the ground next to one of the swings sat a fluffy little gray catnip mouse with black ears and green eyes. It was moving from side to side as if trying to get the attention of the dogs at the park. Kitty moved over to where that was, and then reached out and picked up the toy.<br><br>She moved over to where she had last seen Sergei, moving slowly and carefully so that she didn’t step in anything in the park. She moved carefully, because there was a lot of stuff on the ground in the park. There were food scraps, leaves, pine cones and other stuff on the ground all over the place. She moved carefully so that she wouldn’t step in any of this stuff. She could see where some of it came  from – a lot of it had fallen from the trees overhanging the park. But some of it was just there for no reason.<br><br>As she moved ahead, she saw that Sergei wasn’t at the swing set anymore. He was near the slide, just moving back and forth like he had been before. He was looking at her as she walked towards him.<br><br>“You’re coming to play with me, aren’t you?” said Sergei while wagging his tail at Kitty. “You found my mouse! Now we can chase each other around – it will be so much fun!”<br><br>Kitty stared at him, not sure what to say. She didn’t know why he had this mouse with him, or where he was keeping the rest of them. And then she thought about what he had said about killing the dogs. She didn’t want to be around him if he was going to kill more dogs. She backed away from him, and then ran back towards the entrance of the park.<br><br>Sergei started chasing after her again, but this time Kitty didn’t stop. She just kept running until she could get out of the park – she didn’t know if the other dogs were here because they wanted to play, or if they thought the same thing she did. But she couldn’t stay and find out.<br><br>As soon as Kitty was out of the park, she saw that Jose Cuervo was nearby to her, and called out to him.<br><br>“Hey, Jose Cuervo! I need your help!”<br><br>She waited for him to come over and talk to her, but he just ran past her, and then she saw him enter the park. She started walking towards the entrance again, but didn’t go in – there were two other dogs there, and she wasn’t sure if they wanted to play with the other dogs or not.<br><br>“Hey, hey! Stay there! What’s your problem? Come back here so we can talk.”<br><br>Kitty walked towards where the two dogs were. When she got close enough, she shouted, “What’s going on here? Why are all of you in the park – did you get lost or something? I thought this was a place for dogs to come and play, not for them to",1
Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"my body tells me to feed. And I want to learn how to make sure I don’t kill anyone when I feed on them.”<br><br>The woman looked up at Jenna with a slightly frightened expression on her face, but then she smiled and said, “It would be an honor to be your mentor.

A group of survivors find themselves holed up in an old house in the middle of nowhere.,"For weeks, the group had been holed up in the old house. They were all tired of being inside, but the woods outside were dangerous. The woods harbored plenty of animals, and the thought that a rabid wolf or bear could run into the house was still enough to make them afraid. They had found a way to block all of the doors except for the front door, but they were still afraid of what might be outside.<br><br>There was no food left in the back of the house, and they had already eaten all of their food. They needed to find more food in order to survive. They must think of ways to get out of the house in order to stay alive.<br><br>The group had stayed together out of necessity, but they did not know each other very well. They had spent every day together after their escape from the hospital, but they did not really know each other that well. They knew that staying alive was easier if they stayed together.<br><br>In the beginning of the group’s stay in the house, there had been tension among them, but eventually they overcame their differences and started working together, despite disagreements over what to do on occasion. They must learn how to work together in order to stay alive .<br><br>They did not know much about each other at all, and they knew that there were certain things that they could say to each other without starting unnecessary arguments. They needed to discuss how the group was going to move forward in order to survive.<br><br>Jennifer would think about her father from time to time, and try to learn as much as she could from the others about what had happened. If they learned how to work together for their mutual benefit, they could learn a lot of valuable information that would help them stay alive.<br><br>Stephanie knew that she would never be able to trust Jennifer completely; after all,  she had made a move on her boyfriend, and then lied about it. But if Jennifer showed an interest in working with the group as a whole, and proved trustworthy, Stephanie might be able to put aside her differences with her.<br><br>She waited until after breakfast—which was an egg omelet—to broach the subject.<br><br>“Who’s going out to get fish?” Stephanie asked, sitting in front of the fire with Jennifer and Johnathan Hill. The group had found a couple dozen fish in a lake nearby, but they needed more. They needed fresh protein, something that could sustain the group for a few weeks at least.<br><br>The group needed to find a source of freshwater, something that would provide them with clean water for drinking and bathing.<br><br>“I’ll go find some fresh water,” Johnathan said,  standing and stretching.<br><br>“I’ll take you,” Jennifer said, jumping up as well. “We can walk through the woods nearby, and maybe we can find a stream or something.”<br><br>Stephanie rolled her eyes and turned back to the fire.<br><br>“You’re not a great fighter,” she said, turning toward Jennifer. “And it would be very helpful if you stay here and protected the rest of us. If you leave, I don’t know what will happen to the rest of us. You could die out there, and we’d be all alone and defenseless. If we get attacked while you’re gone, what are we supposed to do? Just lie down and die? We need someone here watching over us at all times so that doesn’t happen.”<br><br>Stephanie had a point. Jennifer looked back at Stephanie with a small smile of agreement. She did need to stay with the rest of the group as much as possible. There were more than enough weapons in the house to protect them, and if anyone came near the house, they’d be able to hear it.<br><br>“I’m sorry, I know I said that I wanted to go, but you’re right. We can’t risk losing any of us, especially me. Alright? I won’t go.”<br><br>Stephanie nodded. “Okay, good. You just stay here and watch over the rest of us while we’re sleeping. I don’t want anyone getting hurt.”<br><br>Jennifer nodded in agreement again, and Stephanie went back to the fire to keep Willow company while she",1
Natalie goes to the police and helps them apprehend Trevor Lockwood before he can hurt anyone else .,"that month, Trevor Lockwood cleared his throat and changed the subject. “So, um, since we have our business out of the way…”<br><br>“You don’t have to worry about my rent anymore!” Natalie said, excited that another problem had been solved. She moved her legs around and leaned closer to Trevor Lockwood so that their shoulders were touching. She looked up at him with a coy smile.<br><br>The police station was located just a few blocks from Trevor Lockwood’s apartment building. The ride in the back of the squad car was short and when they arrived, Natalie was escorted into an interrogation room with a camera above the one-way mirror.<br><br>Natalie sat down on a small chair and looked over at the Detectives sitting across from her. Detectives Johnson and Lassiter of the Seattle Police Department. <br><br>“So, why don’t you tell us what happened?” Detective Johnson asked.<br><br>“I went to meet Trevor Lockwood at his apartment, but it was obvious that something was off about him. He wouldn’t stop staring at my chest and it kinda creeped me out.”<br><br>“Didn’t you report this already? Why are you telling us again?” Detective Lassiter asked.<br><br>Natalie was about to reply when the room filled with a familiar scent. The smell of coffee and bacon, her favorite combination for breakfast.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood walked in and set a plate of food down on the table in front of her.<br><br>“For the love of God, Trevor Lockwood! What do you want from me?”<br><br>Trevor moved closer to her and whispered in her ear. <br><br>“I want you, Natalie Harper.”<br><br>Natalie stood up and pushed him away. The detectives looked over at the two of them before they were startled by a loud banging on the door. They all turned around to see who was there, only to find Trevor standing outside with a knife in his hand.<br><br>“I have your money now, Natalie Harper, and I’m not afraid to use it.”<br><br>Detective Johnson took out his gun and pointed it at Trevor Lockwood. He shook his head in disbelief as he continued to point the gun at him.<br><br>“You can’t come in here with that knife, you crazy son of a bitch! Get out of here or I’ll shoot!”<br><br>Detective Lassiter moved between the two of them and tried to calm them down.<br><br>“Put the gun down, Detective Johnson! We don’t want to escalate this situation any further than it already is! If we take this any further, we could all be in danger. We need to figure out how to diffuse it first. Do you have a warrant?”<br><br>Detective Johnson shook his head.<br><br>“I don’t have a warrant but I do have probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. I’m here to arrest an individual for attempted murder.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter took them into the main police station. They sat down at a long table and Detective Johnson ordered everyone, including the secretaries and other detectives, to leave the room.<br><br>“Now, Detective Johnson, tell me what happened? Who did you come here to arrest? Did this person do something wrong?”<br><br>Detective Lassiter looked at the two policemen in front of him, waiting for one of them to speak up. One of them spoke first.<br><br>“Yes, we have a warrant out for a man named Trevor Lockwood. We think he may be responsible for the disappearance of five young women.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter did a quick internet search on his phone and then sat back in his chair.<br><br>“Wait, this is the same man that you came here to arrest? The one that just arrived here as well? The one who came here to… what exactly did you  say he was here to do? Did he come here to talk with you about something?”<br><br>Detective Johnson opened the folder with documentation for Trevor Lockwood. He handed it across the table to Detective Lassiter.<br><br>“His records indicate that he came here to speak with our witness, so we could arrest him.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter flipped through a few pages and then looked up at the two policemen.<br><br>“Wait, this says here that he is a serial killer?”<br><br>Detective Johnson nodded.<br><br>“That is correct. He has lured five young women to their deaths in the past three years. We believe he tried to lure our witness here today, but that she refused to go with him and instead came here to the police station where we were able to apprehend him.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter continued flipping through pages of paperwork before standing up.<br><br>“Where is this man now? We need to move fast to make an arrest.”<br><br>The two detectives explained that he was in a holding cell in the courthouse. Detective Lassiter left to make arrangements.<br><br>Detective Johnson looked down at the file on his lap and then back up at me.<br><br>“Are you ready to move forward with your statement?”<br><br>I nodded. “Yes, of course! I just need a few minutes though, if that’s okay with you.”<br><br>The two detectives agreed. I exited the room and moved to the side staircase and began climbing. When I reached the fourth floor, I entered an empty courtroom and sat down in front of the large window that overlooked Main Street. It was quiet and peaceful here, but it wouldn’t be for long. I moved to the front of the room and took a seat at the witness stand.<br><br>The courtroom door opened and Detective Johnson walked in. He closed the door behind him and turned to face me as he walked toward the witness stand.<br><br>“No problem, I understand that you just  went through something very traumatic. Take all the time you need to compose yourself. We can keep this quick and easy if you like, or we can take our time…whatever works for you.”<br><br>“It would be good to get this over with so I can begin putting my life back together.”<br><br>Detective Johnson nodded and then walked over to a wooden chair sitting directly in front of the witness stand. He sat down and then paused for a moment before speaking.<br><br>“I have a few questions I need to ask you that will help us move forward, but first I need you to meet someone.”<br><br>“Okay, who is it?”<br><br>Detective Johnson reached into his pocket and removed a piece of paper from inside his wallet. After unfolding the paper he handed it to me, and then moved closer to me.<br><br>“This is a picture of Trevor Lockwood,” he said as he pointed at the photograph. “This man is wanted by the police for multiple counts of kidnapping and murder. According to your statement, you are the latest in a long list of women who went missing under similar circumstances.”<br><br>He moved back to the wooden chair and placed his hands behind his head.<br><br>“The details of the crimes vary in each case, but they all follow the same pattern: The women agreed to meet a handsome man on a certain date after speaking with him online, but when they arrive at the location given by the man they were never heard from again. We have five instances where this exact scenario took place, and in all cases the women went to that location, but never came back.”<br><br>The detective moved closer to me, then continued talking.<br><br>“Lockwood would go to the location where the transactions were supposed to take place, but when a woman arrived there he would either move the location or have one of his accomplices do it. In all cases, no trace of any of these women was ever found again. We have gone to the locations Lockwood has been listed at, but all traces of him were long gone.”<br><br>He moved back to the chair and straightened his tie.<br><br>“The reason why we moved so quickly in this instance is that one of our informers said that Lockwood had been planning to lure yet another woman to her death, and that he had been bragging about it online. We were able to track him down and arrest him before he could carry out his plan.”<br><br>The detective paused for a moment, then looked at me.<br><br>“So, you see, Miss Harper, you are very lucky to be alive.”<br><br>I nodded in understanding, then asked the question that had been on my mind since I had first heard about this case.<br><br>“Detective, why do you think Trevor Lockwood did this?”<br><br>The detective leaned back in his chair and sighed.<br><br>“That, Miss Harper, is something that we may never know for sure. But I have my theories.”",1
"John Doe, the serial killer, tells Valerie that she must escape the basement before dawn or else she will become his next trophy.","to come down the stairs. She saw a set of keys on top of one of the boxes that were all around the basement, and she started to search until she found one with a keychain that said: John Doe in bold letters. Valerie quickly grabbed the keys and darted forward, only to find another solid door in front of her.<br><br>She once again tried the key and found that it would not open this door either. Valerie slid down to the floor of the basement and started to cry. She was trapped in a basement with an insane murderer, and she had no idea what he would do to her next. She closed her eyes, and she could hear the footsteps coming toward her. She tightened up and prepared herself as the door opened.<br><br>The killer ran at Valerie, but she evaded his grasp by rolling out of the way. He kicked her in the side of the head, knocking her to the ground once again. He picked her up by the neck and slammed her down on a nearby table. Valerie’s body went limp as she struggled to breathe.<br><br>He moved to his right side of the basement, where he had placed Valerie’s lifeless body. He placed his hands on her stomach and began to press  in, feeling her ribs pop from his pressure. Valerie grabbed the table with both hands and screamed in pain.<br><br>“Who are you? I don’t know who you are, put me down!” Valerie yelled, but John Doe ignored her cries and continued to feel her up. <br><br>“You have to escape, and you have to do it before dawn. You know that, don’t you? That’s how this game works. You have to escape before dawn or else I will begin taking your life away piece by piece.” John said, his voice thick and ominous.<br><br>Valerie continued to scream as she felt her body being violated. She gritted her teeth and forced herself to stand again, using the table for support.<br><br>John Doe looked at the young woman and smiled. He was about to say something when he heard a noise come from upstairs. He  quickly stood up and grabbed Valerie by the throat, strangling her with his bare hands.<br><br>“What are you doing? Put me down!” Valerie screamed, but she could only manage weak coughs.<br><br>She tried to thrash around in an attempt to loosen his grip, but John Doe was strong. He looked at Valerie with contempt and said, “I want to make this clear to you. You have a head start, and it’s your best chance of getting out of here alive. But if you don’t get out before dawn, then I will come after you myself and give you a head start of your own – head to my chopping block.”<br><br>John Doe let go of Valerie’s throat and walked over to the steps. He turned around and gave the young woman one last cold look before he went upstairs. <br><br>Valerie looked at the basement steps for a brief moment, hoping that John Doe would come down and finish her off. She saw the cellar door start to open, but it was too late; John Doe had left her alone with the sun just beginning to rise from the horizon.<br><br>Valerie shakily reached underneath her and felt for the door handle. She turned around and ran up the steps, falling over in her haste to get away from the basement. She ran into John Doe’s living room, which was now adorned with blood-stained sheets on the walls and blackened  photographs that once showed his happy family, and she ran into the bedroom where his wife and children used to sleep until they were ripped away by his psychotic hands.<br><br>Valerie saw her chance to escape when John Doe came back into the house – he had gone upstairs to change his bloody clothes – and she took off through the front door, which slammed shut behind her.<br><br>John Doe opened the door, ready to chase after Valerie. He stopped when she ran down the steps of the front porch and disappeared around the corner. She was running straight into oncoming traffic, but John Doe did not care. He only cared about one",1

The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,". “Just stay in the hall!”<br><br>Tim was frozen with fear and confusion. “What are you doing?” he asked quietly.<br><br>Julia took a deep breath and turned to Thelma. “Please get me out of here,” she said with difficulty, her voice barely audible. “I think that I’m going to be sick.”<br><br>Thelma nodded and reached for the door, but a loud crashing noise made her freeze in her tracks. Julia had turned around and saw the large dark figures moving towards them. It did not quite look like they were moving, but more like they were flowing. Then the other door opened and the little girl came walking slowly into the room.<br><br>“I am here with your doctor,” she said calmly and smiled at Julia. “He says that he will be able to help you relax and get your thoughts and feelings in order.”<br><br>Thelma moved quickly to the girl’s side and forced her back out of the door. She turned around to face the doctor.<br><br>“What are you doing here? Why are you treating my daughter this way? Why can’t I come in there with her?”<br><br>The doctor looked around the room, as if searching for an answer. He found none and started to move towards the door. “I need to talk to the patient alone, Mrs. Bates. Please wait in the hallway and out of sight until I call you back in.”<br><br>The doctor moved to the door and held it open, but Thelma had moved out of his way. She stood calmly in front of him, blocking his exit.<br><br>“No sir. You will not move from this office until you explain your intentions to this young lady and me and our doctor.”<br><br>The doctor seemed to stare at her for a full minute before he spoke again. “Are you the patient’s mother?”<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>“Do you believe your daughter needs medical or psychiatric treatment?”<br><br>Thelma moved her head slowly in a nod and waited for the doctor to speak. His voice was very calm and monotone as he replied, “I believe your daughter may need medical treatment, but not psychiatric therapy at this time. I recommend that she be seen at the local hospital , where we can give her medical attention and keep her under sedation until the medication starts to take effect.”<br><br>Thelma pulled her body straighter and showed no emotion on her face. “We will provide those services here, Doctor.”<br><br>The doctor shook his head slowly. “I cannot recommend that course of action. I believe it would be in the best interest of your daughter for her to be seen by a specialist at the hospital in Raleigh.”<br><br>Thelma nodded slowly and lowered her head.  “You will cooperate with us, Doctor. If you don’t, I will have you dismissed from this hospital and never allow you to practice medicine again in this county. I am an officer of the law and know how these matters are handled.”<br><br>Timothy Jenks stood and walked swiftly to the door. He opened it and stepped out into the hall. Thelma followed quickly. “Come with me, young lady,” she said as she led Julia out the door.<br><br>Thelma walked silently down the corridor and stopped in front of a closed door. They turned to look at Julia. She was trembling on the verge of panic. “Don’t worry, honey. It will be okay,” Thelma said as she entered the room and closed the door behind her. She walked to the bed and sat on the edge beside Julia.<br><br>Julia looked up at Thelma and started to cry. “What are they going to do with me, Mama?”<br><br>Thelma’s expression changed from one of seething anger to that of a loving mother. She walked slowly to Julia, put her arms around her, and held her close. “Oh, honey. I’m sorry. They are not going to do anything except listen to you and help you get well.”<br><br>“They? What do you mean? You mean they will just listen to me talk about this stuff? That’s all? ”<br><br>As she spoke, Thelma realized that Julia was thinking of going to a psychiatrist. She was relieved that the town doctor refused to heed Thelma’s request. Now, looking into her daughter’s face, she could see the fear and uncertainty that Julia was facing. “Yes, honey. They will listen to you and—“<br><br>Suddenly there was a sound at the door. Thelma turned and saw Karen Jones standing in the doorway of the bedroom. “The doctor wants to talk to you, Dr. Martin. They moved up your appointment.”<br><br>Thelma turned back around to face Julia and continued, “They moved up your appointment because I insisted they do so.” She smiled reassuringly at her daughter and then added, “They are going to  help you get well and I am sure everything will be fine.”<br><br>Julia hesitated, then asked, “So why are you crying?” Thelma turned away as the tears streamed down her face. Julia looked at Karen for understanding, but she had already gone back into the kitchen.<br><br>In the next few minutes, it became clear to Julia that more than one person in town was disturbed by the recent events. First, Julia’s friends avoided her, and when she spoke to them on the telephone they had little to say about anything. Then, one day a group of high school girls came by Julia’s house and began screaming at her.<br><br>“You are possessed by the devil! Get out of town! Go away! We don’t want you here anymore! Get out of town or we will kill you!” Julia was taken completely by surprise her and did not know how to react. She began crying uncontrollably.<br><br>Thelma came running out of the house with a pan in her hand, screaming at the girls to leave her daughter alone. Thelma then turned her attention back to Julia and said, “Julia, I’m so sorry. Please don’t cry. Just leave when you can and never come back here again. Please stop crying Julia, for my sake if not your own.”<br><br>Julia stood outside her house, crying and listening to the screams of the girls moving up the street. Finally, Julia left her house and ran as fast as she could into town. She ran until she could no longer run. She found herself at the town square, collapsed on the grass crying and gasping for air. She was breathing so heavily that it was difficult for her to speak, but Julia managed to say, “I don’t know what’s happening to me. I don’t think I can stay here anymore. Please help me! Please do something! Please make this stop!”<br><br>Julia did not know what else to say. She was exhausted and out of breath. Julia felt alone and scared. Julia sat in the town square, surrounded by trees and empty benches, and cried. Julia cried because she was scared, because she felt alone, because she did not know how to fix what was happening to her, and because she just did not want to feel this way",1
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"Anna Cooper entered the office, a middle-aged black woman with a kind face. She wore a white uniform shirt and black pants that fit perfectly, even if her employer, Mrs. Miller, was not a size six. Mrs. Miller was sitting behind the principal’s desk, typing into her computer. A computer Anna Cooper had never seen before and would not have known how to use if it had been offered to her.<br><br>She stood at attention in front of the desk. She was a janitor and she wanted to show respect for her office, but mainly because there was no one else around. Her first day on job she had come early to get a feel for the place, and now she was waiting patiently.<br><br>Anna Cooper did not know if she would enjoy working for Mrs. Miller yet. But at least she had her looks going for her, and that was more than most of the other janitors at the school could say. Anna Cooper realized that she was being hard on herself. She was pretty, but she was also old. Not old in years, but certainly in looks. And she knew that Mrs. Miller thought she looked like a grandmother-type person, which wasn’t a compliment in Anna’s opinion.  But she was almost forty and did not want to look like she was twenty-five. She had been so young when her daughter died.<br><br>Anna Cooper felt that the principal did not even know her name yet, but Anna Cooper knew Mrs. Miller’s and had studied it carefully in case the principal expected to be called by her first name. It was a complicated one, Karen, but Anna was ready for it.<br><br>Finally the door opened and Karen walked into the room. Anna could tell at once that something was bothering her. “Mrs. Miller?” she said as she approached the desk, then  stopped briefly to give the principal more space. “I’m Anna Cooper.”<br><br>Mrs. Miller held out her hand and said quickly, “Please call me Karen. We need to be on first name terms, Anna. So I hear you are an excellent janitor and that you come highly recommended.”<br><br>Anna Cooper knew that the principal was trying to be friendly, but she was feeling off-put by the woman. And she didn’t like to be called Janitor instead of by her title. But she wanted it known that she didn’t take any nonsense from anyone. “I am not a janitor, Mrs. Miller. I have a title and I wish you would use it when addressing me.”<br><br>There was a brief silence after this statement, but then the principal said in an apologetic tone, “Of course you are, Anna. You are the head janitor and that’s what everyone calls you, right?”<br><br>“No! That is not correct. I am the Director of Facilities Management. Please call me by my title, Mrs. Miller. Or Ms Cooper if you prefer to be polite.”<br><br>Karen frowned at this and then said, “Well, I’ll just call you Janitor Cooper. It’s easier that way. Now, I need to know if you have any special talents in cleaning supplies? Do you use a certain kind of mop? How do you like to clean the floors?“<br><br>It was clear that Karen was trying to cover up for her earlier rudeness, but Anna Cooper wasn’t going to let her off the hook. She was offended by the term Janitor and it was also clear that Karen Miller had a problem with following orders. She was already starting to suspect that this would not be a good working relationship.<br><br>However, while this is something that she could work with, there were much more pressing issues. Anna Cooper needed to know what kind of writing was on the chalkboards and whether or not there were any more symbols that matched the one Daniel had shown her.<br><br>“I have no special talents in cleaning supplies,” Anna Cooper said directly. She figured this would get the discussion going again in the right direction.<br><br>“Well, that’s just great! We’re going to have a nice long talk about this ,” Karen Miller snapped.<br><br>“I think that is a bad idea,” Anna Cooper responded, “But it seems to me that you have an agenda and I don’t think it has anything to do with helping me out. So I suggest we end this conversation right here.”<br><br>The principal looked at the janitor for a second and then seemed to deflate. “Okay, but if that symbol shows up again, even on the back of a piece of paper in the trash can, I want to know about it first thing. Do you understand?”<br><br>One of the most obvious aspects of symbolism on the chalkboard is that it includes pictures of crucifixion.<br><br>Crucifixion is an old form of execution in which someone is nailed to a wooden cross. Crucifixion was originally meant as a form of punishment for those who were considered evil or heretics. Crucifixion was widely practiced by the Romans, but became increasingly unpopular in Western Europe.<br><br>Crucifixion was outlawed in some countries during the Middle Ages, but it was still practiced in England until 1853, and remained a legal method of execution in some of the world until very recently. Crucifixion is an extremely unusual method of execution for modern times, and it has been used mostly by people who are considered to be fringe groups or religious extremists.<br><br>Flailing crucifixions is a specific form of crucifixion where the victim is tied and whipped before being nailed to a cross. Flailing crucifixions refers to the violent whipping that usually accompanies crucifixion. Flailing is not an official part of the method of crucifixion, but it does occur often in countries that still practice it. Flailing is typically done with sharp metal rods or other implements, and often includes brutal beatings. The beating takes place while the cross is being raised off of the ground, and flailing is supposed to make the crucifixion more painful. Crucifixions are sometimes depicted in art, including famous works on the subject by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Flailing crucifixions are more common in modern times than flogging deaths, but depictions of both continue to appear in mainstream art.<br><br>Flailing crucifixions have been condemned by many religious leaders over the years. During the Middle Ages, flailing was condemned by Pope Gregory IX, who called it a sacrilegious act.<br><br>Crucifixion is an extreme form of torture,",0

I started looking around for something to cut my food with when I noticed my refrigerator.<br><br>I hadn’t really looked at the refrigerator before, but now that I did, I realized that it was full. Unfortunately, there was nothing in there that I recognized. I looked around for a few minutes, but couldn’t find anything to cook with.<br><br>I decided that it was too early in the morning to think about food, so I walked back into the living room and sat down on the couch. I picked up one of the video games and started playing.<br><br> -----<br><br>The next morning, I woke up with a headache. It wasn’t a bad headache, but it was certainly enough to make me feel the need to take a shower. As I got out of bed and walked across the living room, I noticed that there was an alarm clock on the coffee table. The clock read 11:00 in the morning, so I had spent at least a few hours sleeping in.<br><br>I walked into the bathroom and turned on the water. I looked through my medicine cabinet for some aspirin, but didn’t see any in there. I opened my medicine cabinet and found a few bottles of prescription pills, but none of them had aspirin listed on the bottle.<br><br>I stepped into the shower and let the hot water run over me. It felt great, and I was starting to feel a lot better. I got out of the shower and dried off before putting on some clothes.<br><br>I didn’t even have to think about what I was going to wear. When I was packing up my things to move out, I made sure that I packed all of the clothes I owned. There were at least five sets of clothes in my closet.<br><br>The only problem was that I still didn’t remember how to get into my apartment. Every time I thought about it, it just got me more confused. There had to be a door somewhere, but where?<br><br>I decided that it would be best to ask one of my neighbors about the doors in my apartment. I went down to the living room and started looking for one of them. I walked around for a few minutes, but didn’t see any doors. I started getting a little frustrated, and was ready to call a locksmith when I found a door.<br><br>The door was at the end of the room near the kitchen. I opened it up and found myself standing in a hallway. This hallway had a door to my left and another one across from it. As I walked down the hallway, I decided that I should probably try to find out what was on the other side of the first door. If I was lucky, it would be a closet and I would be able to change into something else.<br><br>I walked over to the door and opened it up.<br><br>I was shocked to see that I didn’t find myself in a closet at all. Instead, I found myself in a bedroom. It was completely empty, except for a bed. There weren’t any drawers or even a desk to be found. This room was completely bare.<br><br>I walked around the room for a few minutes, but couldn’t find anything in there that would help me get some clothes. I decided that I would just have to find out what was on the other side of the second door.<br><br>As I walked over to the other door, I couldn’t help but think about how strange it was that there was a bedroom in my apartment that I didn’t even know about. Who decided to put the bedroom there, and when? It seemed to be completely random.<br><br>I opened the door and walked into the room.<br><br>I was standing in a spare bedroom. The bed was made, and there were a few books on the nightstand. There were two doors in this room as well. One of them led to the bathroom that I had been using last night, and the other one led to what looked like an office. Behind the desk was a lamp and a few papers. There was also a computer sitting on the desk, but it was turned off.<br><br>I decided that I would look for the spare bedroom when I was done in here. It could be useful to have an extra room in my apartment, especially one that has a bed in it. I got out some clothes and started changing. As I was changing, I started to wonder if the spare bedroom had a closet. That would really be useful, since I only had one closet in my room that I could use for all of my clothes.<br><br>I put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt before walking over to the door that led to the bedroom. I opened it up and started looking for a closet. Just as I was about to give up, I saw it, tucked away in the corner of the room.<br><br>I quickly walked over to the closet and started to look for things that would fit. I was hoping that there would be a ton of hangers, but that wasn’t the case. There were only five hangers in the closet, and they were all full. Luckily, all of the clothes on there were clothes that I didn’t own.<br><br>I picked out the first shirt I saw and tossed it on the bed. It was a light blue shirt with “Frolic” written across it in capital letters. I didn’t think that shirt looked very good on me and decided to just keep looking. The next shirt I picked up was for a little kid, so I threw that back on the ground. The next one was a yellow shirt with a picture of a taco on it. I didn’t really like that one either, so I kept looking.<br><br>The next shirt was red with a picture of a fish on it. It seemed like an obvious choice, so I grabbed it and put it",0
"When Jack is alone, he talks to her.","laid in bed, holding each other, crying for a long time. Eventually they fell asleep and Jack woke up after a couple of hours – he didn’t even realize that he had fallen asleep – to find her lying next to him, sound asleep. He lay there watching her sleep for a while before getting up to go to the bathroom. As he was walking back, she opened her eyes and looked up at him.<br><br>“Jack? Are you okay?”<br><br>He came back closer to the bed and answered, “I’m fine. I just had something important to tell you. Can we talk?”<br><br>“Of course. Go ahead.”<br><br>“Eliza, remember that day last summer when we got each other flowers and went out on our first date? Remember how much fun we had? Remember how happy we were?” Jack continued.<br><br>“Of course. You told me about it every day since then too.” she said with a smile on her face. “Tell me about today then.”<br><br>Jack paused for a moment and thought about it. “Today I felt the same way as I did day. Except today, the flowers weren’t because of you. They were from my new boss to tell me about my new job tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning, I start working again after six months off to take care of you. That job is the reason why I haven’t gone completely insane yet.” Jack said this last part with a sigh and then thought about it again. “I don’t know, maybe my days just feel so long because we haven’t properly celebrated my birthday yet. Maybe we should do that tomorrow night?” he asked her. “Just us two? I promise I’ll tell you about my new job then too.”<br><br>Jack smiled. “That sounds like fun. Let’s do it then; just you and me, okay?”<br><br>Jack nodded and she smiled again, this time bigger than before. Jack told her about his day and he told her about the latest news. He told her about everything from his new boss to Donald Trump and then back to his new job again. He talked about everything he did that day and all of the things that he didn’t do too. He talked about everything that happened  in his house, from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to bed. He told her about his dreams and his hopes and how he only got an hour of sleep last night because he just couldn’t stop thinking about her.<br><br>Halfway through, Eliza stopped listening. Her smile had disappeared and her face had dropped into her hands again. Jack stopped talking but continued to smile at her. He continued to look at the living room wall and he could tell that she didn’t hear him anymore. Jack knew she didn’t want to hear him say everything that he was saying, but he did anyway. He kept talking because he thought it would help, but now it was making things worse.<br><br>Jack watched her face as tears trickled down her cheeks and he could hear her sobbing. The living room door opened and closed softly as Eliza walked away from him, into the kitchen. Jack sat on the living room couch and watched her try to wipe her face with one hand while holding a wine glass with the other.<br><br>“Eliza?” Jack asked her. She didn’t answer him, but moved to the refrigerator and opened it.<br><br>“Did you go to the store?” she said to no one.<br><br>Jack moved toward her slowly, his legs weak. His eyes were filling with tears again now that he saw her crying. He didn’t want her to cry alone and he wanted to say everything that he thought might make her feel better, but he moved slowly because he was unsure if she wanted to hear it.<br><br>“I know you don’t want to hear me talk about it,” Jack said to her. He moved closer and stood behind her as she leaned against the fridge door.<br><br>“But I can’t stop,” he continued. “Every time I open my mouth you move away from me, but I need to tell you what happened today and how your life is going to be better soon now that I have this job and we can move.”<br><br>She moved away from the fridge and turned around to face him. She looked at him and then over his shoulder.<br><br>“Move?” she asked.<br><br>“I got a new job, a good one, and we can move now that I have the money, and if you  want to go somewhere warm, we can go anywhere you want. There are so many places and I can take you to -”<br><br>“We?” she asked. She looked down at her feet. “What do you mean ‘we?’”<br><br>Jack sat down on the floor in front of her. “But you can come along, you can be there with me, we can talk about anything and everything -”<br><br>Eliza stood up and moved away from him. She turned back to him quickly though and said, “You say we as if I’m not here,” she said.<br><br>She moved again and went to the bedroom. She opened the door but didn’t enter. She moved closer to the door and looked inside.<br><br>Jack followed her into the bedroom. He looked around at the bed - a single bed - and then at Eliza.<br><br>“I moved your clothes,” she said. “And I tried to change things around, but it’s still the same bedroom, it’s still the same house. But you never move on, do you? You just sit here and you go through the motions of moving on, but that’s all you do. You don’t actually move on, you just sit here and talk to me like I’m not actually gone. Like this is some sort of delusion and I haven’t actually left you. Like  I’ll be coming back one day. Like my death isn’t final, that it isn’t final. You can move on but I can’t, or you won’t let me?” she said.<br><br>Jack didn’t know how to reply to this. He stared at her for a second and then turned away.<br><br>“You know, you never did tell me where this new place is,” she said.<br><br>Jack turned around again to look at Eliza and thought about the answer. The room was empty except for Eliza and him, but it felt crowded now.<br><br>“It’s in the city, on the other side of town. It’s only about twenty miles from here. Just over there along the coast,” he said.<br><br>Eliza frowned and turned toward the window instead of Jack. She moved the curtain aside to look out. “Well at least it’s on the coast,” she said.<br><br>Jack moved a little bit closer to her and placed his hand on her arm. The movement startled her and she looked at him with an expression of surprise. She moved away from him and turned toward the side of the bed instead.<br><br>“Why are you moving?” she asked. “Aren’t you happy here? I mean, this is where we lived together, isn’t it? You know, when we were happy. This is the room that we shared.”<br><br>Jack moved a few steps closer to her and then sat down on the edge of the bed next to her. He was silent for a moment, but then continued to speak.<br><br>“It’s not that I don’t want to live here. I live here at the moment because I have nothing else, but that can change. I want to move out there so that we can be together again, you and me. We can be happy together and live in a nice house near the ocean, where it is green and warm all year round. It doesn’t snow there, does it?”<br><br>Eliza moved a little closer to him again and looked into his eyes.<br><br>“Tell me,” she said softly. “Why move to this place? Isn’t it just like our old place? Why not move somewhere",1
Aimee Kincaid goes home after a long day at work only to find her apartment empty and her loneliness amplified by the silence.,"Aimee thought it might be a bad idea. The past few days she had only been able to think about one thing -- the man who had spoken to her at the coffee shop. His words had left an impression on her, and Aimee often found herself wondering about them during the day as she worked at P&P Insurance.<br><br>Aimee Kincaid was a woman in her late thirties. She had been divorced for a few years now, and had since moved out of the family home she had shared with her husband. As a single woman, she was proud of her independence and ability to take care of herself, but lately those feelings had started to change. She felt an emptiness inside that nothing could fill, and she wondered if she would ever feel the passion and love that she had once known.<br><br>She had been seeing men since her divorce, but only a few of them had really gotten to know her. Most of them complained about the fact that she was a bit older than them and didn’t have any kids. She had stopped seeing a few of them because they were just too young for her, and one of them had even tried to pressure her into physical intimacy. Aimee had been very disappointed with that encounter, as she thought he could have at least respected her enough to wait until she wanted it too. She decided to call it quits with that one.<br><br>She had never really been one to go out and meet people. She was perfectly content working, paying her bills, and living a quiet life. Lately, though, she was starting to feel like something was missing from her life. After he spoke to her, Aimee had been unable to get him out of her head. She was sure he was married, but that didn’t stop her from thinking about him. She even daydreamed about walking into the coffee shop and seeing him sitting there again.<br><br>Aimee slowly walked into the store, hoping that he would still be there. It was a small shop, and she was worried that he might have already left. She took her time walking up to the counter, hoping to see him as she did. To her relief, he was still there. He had taken off his jacket, and Aimee could see that his dark brown hair was starting to get slightly longer on top.<br><br>When she reached the counter, they made small talk about the weather. After a few minutes, he looked up at her with a cheeky grin, and said her name.<br><br>“Aimee, right?”<br><br>Aimee blushed a little at his greeting.<br><br>“Yes, I think you might have seen me before.”<br><br>He laughed. “I’m not sure, there are a lot of women in this town.”<br><br>Aimee smiled at his remark. “I’ll take a peppermint tea with honey, please.”<br><br>He smirked and grabbed some tea off the shelf. “Sounds good. What brings you in today?”<br><br>Aimee bit her lip, deciding whether or not to tell him the truth. Just as she was about to talk, the shop door opened and a woman walked in. She was stunning – her dark hair was pulled back into a tight bun, and he could see that her eyes were a striking violet. Her lips were full and sensual, and her figure was amazing in a black pencil skirt and designer blouse. He looked at her and smiled.<br><br>“Oh, hi, I don’t think we have met. I’m Jack,” he said, offering his hand to the woman.<br><br>She smiled, revealing perfect white teeth as she reached up to shake his hand. “Natalie. I work for a magazine, and my boss told me about this place.”<br><br>He raised an eyebrow at her comment. “Really? And who is your boss?”<br><br>Natalie smiled again. “My boss is named Patrick. He’s really nice, you should meet him sometime.”<br><br>He laughed at her comment. “I think I will. So, what brings you into the shop?”<br><br>Natalie sat down at the end of the counter with a sigh. “My boss asked me to interview the owner of this place for a project he’s working on.”<br><br>Jack smiled and nodded. “Well, you’ve come to the right place! I’m Jack, and this is Aimee, she owns the place.”<br><br>Aimee stuck out her hand and smiled at the woman. “Oh, I see. Well it’s nice to meet you.”<br><br>Natalie raised an eyebrow. “I see you two already know each other.”<br><br>Aimee blushed and smiled. “I guess you could say that we’re friends.”<br><br>Natalie smiled at her words, and Jack felt a smile creep on his face.<br><br>“Well, you two have fun with your friendliness! I’m afraid we have to run, Natalie. Thanks for the tea!”<br><br>Natalie nodded and waved goodbye to Aimee and Jack. As soon as they were out of sight, she rolled her eyes at his remark.<br><br>“I can’t believe you just said that! She’s so fucking pretty, and you have no idea how perfect I know she would be for you!”<br><br>Jack rolled his eyes and sat down at the counter. “That’s really not important right now, Nat.”<br><br>“Oh, I think it is very important! You could be dating her by now! I can tell she definitely wants to go out with you!”<br><br>Jack laughed and shook his head. “Do you always have to be so loud, Nat?”",0
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.",". “You are not a bad girl!” he barked in an excited voice.<br><br>Then the little dog suddenly stopped wagging his tail and looked at Kitty very seriously. He stared at her for a moment, then said “I don’t understand why somebody would yell at you for being a bad girl when you’re not—can I help you? Can I be of any assistance to you in any way?”<br><br>Kitty did not know what to say. She began staring at the ground, not sure what to do next.<br><br>Lulu Laverne stared at Kitty for a long moment. Then he nodded his head and smiled again. “I see that you have a problem,” he said in an understanding voice. “In fact, I think I can help you solve it!”<br><br>Kitty stared at the little dog. He was so kind and friendly that she almost forgot about the other men shouting at her.<br><br>“What is your name?” Kitty finally asked, still staring at the ground.<br><br>Lulu Laverne’s tail started wagging again, and his little ears perked up. “My name is Lulu Laverne,” he said in a friendly voice. Kitty looked up at him and smiled. It was nice to see that a dog could be so friendly, especially when some people were being so cruel to her. “And what is your name?”<br><br>Kitty hesitated a moment before answering. She still did not know if Sergei was still watching her and listening, but she realized that the kind little dog seemed to genuinely care about her. She began looking up at him again and said, “My name is Kitty Pawsky. I’m a private detective who moved here from the city because I like country life. But now there are some big problems here in the park, and I think it would be good if we all worked together on it. Do you think we can do that?”<br><br>Lulu Laverne stopped moving for a moment, and his happy face slowly began to turn a little more serious. “I see you moving your tail,” Kitty said gently. “Is there something wrong? Do you not want to talk about it?” <br><br>Lulu Laverne turned his head away from her. “It’s okay,” he muttered in a quiet voice. “I just have one friend here in the park who likes to tease me sometimes. He leaves catnip mice and feathers all over my house so that I’ll get into trouble when the other dogs see them. Sometimes he even comes inside on of the houses and scares me while I’m sleeping, but then he always leaves a treat for me by my bed, so it’s okay.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “So your friend is the one who does these bad things?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne shook his head. “No, he doesn’t do it! He just likes to watch me get into trouble.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “Then it sounds like he’s the one who is doing these bad things, since you keep getting into trouble,” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne sighed. “I told him to stop a long time ago, but he won’t listen,” he said. “And now I have to go in this house and do my homework…”<br><br>Kitty frowned. She knew that this was a bad thing that this friend was doing to Lulu Laverne, but she wasn’t exactly sure how to help him.<br><br>“Why doesn’t your friend listen to you?” she asked.<br><br>Lulu Laverne sighed again and shook his head. “I don’t know, he just doesn’t like to be told what to do, I guess.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “But you are his friend, and he must care about you a lot, right?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne smiled. “Yeah, he does care about me a lot,” he said. “You know, I’m starting to think that maybe I’ll just go into the house and tell my parents about it so they can help me.”<br><br>Kitty smiled as well. “That sounds like a good idea,” she said. Then, after a moment, she continued . “Do your homework first though, okay?”<br><br>Lulu Laverne laughed. “All right, I’ll do that first!” he said. He started walking off through the park as Kitty called after him.<br><br>“Lulu, stay safe, okay?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne stopped and turned around to look at her. She smiled again. “I will, Kitty, I will!” he said. He continued walking towards his house as Kitty watched him go. She turned her gaze back to the park.<br><br>She saw that Sergei was heading for the swing set. The dogs were looking at him as he approached them. Kitty didn’t understand it, but she was glad that the dogs had someone to play with besides just each other and her; it’s much better when there are more people around to make everything a little more fun.<br><br>Kitty moved towards the swing set, ready to go off on another adventure into the dog park and try to figure out what was going on. She had followed Sergei to where he always seemed to go, and now she would work her way through the park and see what sort of clues she could discover.<br><br>There was something going on here, Kitty was sure of it. She moved closer to the swing set. The park was quiet. Nothing moved except for the trees and the leaves on them. Kitty moved towards the slide near the swings and moved in a position where she could see both of the swings.<br><br>She was moving closer to the swing set when she saw it – a catnip mouse. On the ground next to one of the swings sat a fluffy little gray catnip mouse with black ears and green eyes. It was moving from side to side as if trying to get the attention of the dogs at the park. Kitty moved over to where that was, and then reached out and picked up the toy.<br><br>She moved over to where she had last seen Sergei, moving slowly and carefully so that she didn’t step in anything in the park. She moved carefully, because there was a lot of stuff on the ground in the park. There were food scraps, leaves, pine cones and other stuff on the ground all over the place. She moved carefully so that she wouldn’t step in any of this stuff. She could see where some of it came  from – a lot of it had fallen from the trees overhanging the park. But some of it was just there for no reason.<br><br>As she moved ahead, she saw that Sergei wasn’t at the swing set anymore. He was near the slide, just moving back and forth like he had been before. He was looking at her as she walked towards him.<br><br>“You’re coming to play with me, aren’t you?” said Sergei while wagging his tail at Kitty. “You found my mouse! Now we can chase each other around – it will be so much fun!”<br><br>Kitty stared at him, not sure what to say. She didn’t know why he had this mouse with him, or where he was keeping the rest of them. And then she thought about what he had said about killing the dogs. She didn’t want to be around him if he was going to kill more dogs. She backed away from him, and then ran back towards the entrance of the park.<br><br>Sergei started chasing after her again, but this time Kitty didn’t stop. She just kept running until she could get out of the park – she didn’t know if the other dogs were here because they wanted to play, or if they thought the same thing she did. But she couldn’t stay and find out.<br><br>As soon as Kitty was out of the park, she saw that Jose Cuervo was nearby to her, and called out to him.<br><br>“Hey, Jose Cuervo! I need your help!”<br><br>She waited for him to come over and talk to her, but he just ran past her, and then she saw him enter the park. She started walking towards the entrance again, but didn’t go in – there were two other dogs there, and she wasn’t sure if they wanted to play with the other dogs or not.<br><br>“Hey, hey! Stay there! What’s your problem? Come back here so we can talk.”<br><br>Kitty walked towards where the two dogs were. When she got close enough, she shouted, “What’s going on here? Why are all of you in the park – did you get lost or something? I thought this was a place for dogs to come and play, not for them to",1
The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"After that, I just need you to focus on getting better now.”<br><br>Lisa stood up at this point and walked into the other room to collect Daisy’s notebook. She returned to her chair and opened up the notebook. The first few pages were dedicated to instructions on how their family was going to take care of things while she was away, and the last few pages contained some words of wisdom that she wanted her children to read after they got over the initial shock of her passing.<br><br>Just before she started reading, Lisa stopped and held the notebook up for a moment, considering her words. “You know, maybe I shouldn’t read this part of the notebook to them.”<br><br>“Oh? Why not?”<br><br>“It might be too much to handle at one time. It might be too much for them to process all at once.”<br><br>Lisa stopped to consider that point for a moment, then looked up at Daisy. “Can I just tell them some things right now, and read the rest of the words later?”<br><br>“Of course. Whatever you think is best for your children. But there are some things that I have written down that I would like them to hear before I pass on.”<br><br>Lisa nodded her head and settled back into her chair. “Okay, well first, they should know that you wrote about how proud you were of them. Both the way they have dealt with this so far, and the way they have taken care of everything at home while I’m at the hospital with you. You talked a lot about how much confidence you had in them to do the job, even when I wasn’t here. You said that you thought Lisa was ready to handle almost everything, and that she was ready to take over the business if she ever had to. And you were also very proud of both of them for all their hard work in school. You said that you had a good feeling about the direction they were headed.” Lisa paused at this point, but she could see in Daisy’s eyes that she was still fully awake and listening. “I’m not sure when they should know about the other parts, though,” she continued. “You talked about some important things that will affect them when I’m gone. There were things that we need to talk about as a family. ”<br><br>At this point, Daisy’s eyelids began to flutter a little bit and she gasped for air. Lisa looked over at the nurse at the desk and made some hand gestures, which got her attention. The nurse came over and checked Daisy’s vital signs before looking back at Lisa and nodding. “It’s probably just a side effect from these injections,” she explained. “She might need some oxygen for a few minutes, but she should be fine. Give her a second to rest and then try to talk again.”<br><br>Lisa nodded and put the side of her hand on Daisy’s forehead to check her temperature. “I should have brought your hat,” she said as she thought about what else might be troubling Daisy.<br><br>“Is it going to be all right?” Daisy asked in a groggy voice. “Are you going to be there when everything happens?”<br><br>Lisa tried to speak through her own nervousness. “Of course I will be there,” she assured Daisy and then moved closer to listen as the nurse explained what was happening. “I think you might be getting a little bit of a fever,” she said as she took Daisy’s pulse. “They just need to give you some oxygen and we should be on our way again soon. You have been such a trooper,” the nurse continued before turning to Lisa and adding, “You’ve been doing a terrific job of taking care of her. She’s got a great family. I know she will be fine.”<br><br>Lisa tried to control her breathing and nodded in response. “As soon as they give you the okay, I’ll go sit with my mom in the waiting room. She’s already told me all the things she wanted me to know if something happened,” she said before the nurse could interrupt.<br><br>Daisy opened her eyes and slowly turned her head toward Lisa. “Thank you for being there for all of us today,” she said. “I know it hasn’t been easy for you, but if there is any way I can repay you someday, just let me know.”<br><br>Lisa reached out a hand and brought it to her lips in response. “I don’t want to talk  about that just yet. I just want to get through today and see how things look in the morning. After we talk to the doctor tomorrow, I’ll have a better idea of what we need to do after you leave here.”<br><br>When Lisa turned back toward Daisy, her eyes were filled with tears. The nurse stepped up beside them and wiped her hand on a tissue before reaching out to touch Daisy’s arm.<br><br>“Mrs. Mayberry, I think your daughter is worn out and needs to go home for a little while before coming back this evening. She has been such a help today and really been an inspiration to many of the other patients. I know she is a special person, but her strength today has been so uplifting to everyone here.”<br><br>Daisy nodded in agreement as the nurse spoke. “I think she should go home too. She gets up early every day, comes to take care of me, and then gets back here before dark to do whatever I need her to do. If you don’t mind, I would like her to stay here with me tonight. I want us to talk for a while before she goes home.”<br><br>Lisa glanced over at her and smiled weakly, but it was obvious that the emotional strain from the day was now starting to show. As they stood up and started walking toward the door, Lisa reached out and squeezed her mom’s hand. “I know you are tired, but I’m glad you are staying here tonight. I really want to talk about this afternoon and what happened in my office.”<br><br>“Me too,” Daisy said as she squeezed her hand back. “I think you should get some rest though because I want to tell you all about it while it is still fresh in my mind.”<br><br>They both smiled at one another as they walked out of the room and started down the hall toward Lisa’s office. There was a sudden explosion of activity around them as nurses and doctors scurried to and fro with charts, medicine carts, equipment, and other assorted paraphernalia. However, the commotion abruptly ended as they entered the hallway and walked by without a glance at them.<br><br>In the quiet of the hallway, they made their way down to Lisa’s office and took seats across from each other on her sofa. “Okay,  tell me everything you know about this trial,” Lisa said as she picked up her laptop and began turning it on.<br><br>Daisy sighed heavily as she sat back in the love seat and pulled her feet up underneath her. She pulled both hands through her hair in frustration, and then started talking. “I really don’t know much about it except that the doctor said it is an experimental treatment for people with the particular type of lung cancer I have. He told me that he was sending me to Memorial Hospital in St. Louis for an evaluation before I could be enrolled in the trial. He said he had been contacted by a research committee at the hospital and that they would meet me and evaluate me. I’m supposed to leave tomorrow at noon,” she said as she leaned back and covered her eyes with her hand.<br><br>Lisa sat behind her desk and folded her hands in front of her. “That’s great news! It will be such a relief to have you out of the house and somewhere where I can drop by whenever I need to. You’ve become too difficult to deal with lately,” she said. She quickly added, “I don’t mean that as an insult.”<br><br>Daisy looked at Lisa and smiled. “I know you didn’t mean it as an insult. I have been difficult to deal with lately, but maybe now that I am leaving for a while it will give you some rest and you won’t feel so overwhelmed. Maybe it will also relieve Bill of some of the stress he’s been under,” she said. They both sat silently for a moment before Daisy continued, “I think this could be the answer to our problems. I could come through this and we wouldn’t have to worry so much about where the money is going to come from. We could be financially secure again. And, as we used to say in school…it will be like having found the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.”<br><br>“I agree,” said Lisa. She then added, “But what about me? How do I know that you’re going to come through this and be fine? What if it doesn’t work out and you die anyway? How can I go on living without you? You’re all I have. Who is going to take care of me",1

A typical application for such a device is as a cell phone base station. The transmit portion of such a device includes an RF power amplifier for amplifying RF signals, while the receive portion of such a device includes an RF receiver for down converting high frequency signals to base band. Since a typical cellular communication signal has a total bandwidth of approximately 30 MHz, the bandwidth of the RF power amplifier and RF receiver should be greater than approximately 30 MHz.<br><br>A quadrature modulator and a SAW filter are typically used to down convert the high frequency signals generated by the RF receiver to base band. The RF input signals received by the RF receiver are converted to the intermediate frequency (IF) range by mixing with a local oscillator signal.

Mary Smith walks home from work and becomes the victim of a mugging attempt by John Doe.,"I remember when the mugging all started. Ever since I was a little girl, I had dreamed of being an artist. I used to take my crayons and pencils and draw pictures of fairies and unicorns in my coloring books. As I grew older, I began to explore other mediums, like sketching and painting, though I never felt comfortable with those forms of art. My true talent was sculpting. It was the only thing that gave me enough freedom and control to express myself.<br><br>	I was a young college graduate, and I still had not found a job in my field. With the bills piling up and no income, I had to take any job that I could find. It was so disappointing when I found out that the café that I was hired at was only going to pay me $2 an hour. The job paid well for a café, but it was a far cry from what I should be making. When I got home from work that day, my mood was as low as my bank account balance. As I paced back and forth in my studio, a knock on the door interrupted my thoughts.<br><br>I answered the door, only to find the landlord standing in the doorway. “Sorry to bother you,” he said, rather confused. “But there’s been a leak in the house that we’ve been trying to find for some time.”<br><br>“I’m so sorry! I bet I know what it is,” I said as I went to the water heater in the basement. The landlord followed me downstairs with a flashlight. As I turned the water heater toward him, the pipe that was leaking finally gave way and spewed water all over us.<br><br>“Oh, no! You are going to have to pay the plumber for this,” the landlord exclaimed.<br><br>“Let me go get my wallet, and I will pay for it right now,” I said as I ran up to my studio. I opened my wallet, but there were only a few dollars in it.<br><br>“It will be $50 to repair it, then. Oh well, at least you get yourself a new water heater out of this,” said the landlord as he handed me back my wallet.<br><br>“I would take care of it myself, but I don’t know how.”<br><br>“Well, at least you are getting something out of it.”<br><br>“I’ll let you know how much it is when I get the bill,” I said as I backed into my studio.<br><br>I sat on the couch and tried to figure out a way that I could pay for the repair. “If only I could get a job doing something that I was good at.”<br><br>That is when the idea of mugging came to my mind. I knew that I needed money, and I was looking for a way to get it without having to work for it. After a few minutes, I figured it all out. There were not many people in the alley, so it would be easy to catch someone off guard and steal their valuables. Then I would be able to pay for the repair to my water heater, and I would still have some money left over for myself.<br><br>I felt a bit guilty about my plan, but I did not see how else I was going to get the money that I needed. As I came up to my door, I slipped on my coat and hat and headed out into the alley.<br><br>      I was hiding behind a dumpster when I saw John Doe coming toward me. He had a few grocery bags in his hands, so it would be an easy job. I followed him to the end of the alley and waited for him to come to a stop. I got closer to him, but did not make any sudden moves.<br><br>      “Hello there,” I said as I slipped past him and went into the alley. Suddenly, he turned and pointed his finger at me. “What are you doing?” he said as he took a defensive stance.<br><br>“What does it look like? I’m trying to mug you,” I said as I fished out my knife from my purse. “Now hand over all of your valuables or else I will cut you,” I commanded.<br><br>     John Doe looked at me as if he didn’t know whether or not I was telling the truth. Then he took a step toward me, and I knew that I had to act fast. Just as he was about to lunge at me with his fist, I lunged forward with my blade. The blade cut through his shirt, but not his skin. As he backed away from me, I could tell that he was not afraid of me. He was going to try and take my knife away from me.<br><br>     I quickly pulled my blade back into its sheath and then took a defensive stance. I was amazed at how fast he was. I was not even sure that I saw him move, and the next thing that I knew he had my knife.<br><br>“Now what are you going to do?” he said as he held my knife in his hand.<br><br>“I guess it was not such a good idea after all,” I said as I began to cry. “I’m sorry. Let me go, and I will never do it again.”<br><br>     John Doe let go of my blade and then took a step backward. As soon as he let go of the blade, I quickly pulled it out of his hand. I then turned toward him and took another defensive stance. He looked at me as if he didn’t know whether or not he should attack me again.<br><br>As soon as he made up his mind to attack, I attacked him with my blade. It cut through his shirt, but not his skin. “Where is your knife?” I asked him once I pulled my blade out of his shirt",0

They were all nice knives, but none of them were as nice as the one that I was currently holding.<br><br>     “I guess that I should go and look for whoever has my knife,” I thought as I put the cleaning cloth back in the drawer and walked into the living room.<br><br>I then walked into my bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to look my best, so I put on a pair of blue jeans and a pink spaghetti tank top. I decided to leave my make-up off and put my hair in a ponytail.<br><br>     “I am not going to go out looking like I do on a normal basis,” I said as I walked out of the house.<br><br>I didn’t know that I was being watched. After a few minutes of walking, I saw someone standing in the alley. When I approached him, he said, “I told you that you would be coming here.”<br><br>     “Who are you?” I asked as I walked closer to him.<br><br>     “I am only an innocent man trying to get his knife back,” he said as he took a step back.<br><br>     “Why do you want your knife back so badly?” I asked as I took another step closer to him.<br><br>     “I have had that knife for many years now and it has been my favorite possession. I was using it today when you walked in and stole it,” he replied.<br><br>I then looked down at the knife in my hands. It was indeed the knife that he had in his hand.<br><br>     “I didn’t steal your knife,” I said as I dropped it to the ground.<br><br>He quickly picked it back up and said, “You stole it and I want it back.”<br><br>     “I think someone is playing a cruel trick on me, because I never stole that knife,” I said as I looked at him.<br><br>He didn’t look like the type of person to play games with other people.

The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,". “Just stay in the hall!”<br><br>Tim was frozen with fear and confusion. “What are you doing?” he asked quietly.<br><br>Julia took a deep breath and turned to Thelma. “Please get me out of here,” she said with difficulty, her voice barely audible. “I think that I’m going to be sick.”<br><br>Thelma nodded and reached for the door, but a loud crashing noise made her freeze in her tracks. Julia had turned around and saw the large dark figures moving towards them. It did not quite look like they were moving, but more like they were flowing. Then the other door opened and the little girl came walking slowly into the room.<br><br>“I am here with your doctor,” she said calmly and smiled at Julia. “He says that he will be able to help you relax and get your thoughts and feelings in order.”<br><br>Thelma moved quickly to the girl’s side and forced her back out of the door. She turned around to face the doctor.<br><br>“What are you doing here? Why are you treating my daughter this way? Why can’t I come in there with her?”<br><br>The doctor looked around the room, as if searching for an answer. He found none and started to move towards the door. “I need to talk to the patient alone, Mrs. Bates. Please wait in the hallway and out of sight until I call you back in.”<br><br>The doctor moved to the door and held it open, but Thelma had moved out of his way. She stood calmly in front of him, blocking his exit.<br><br>“No sir. You will not move from this office until you explain your intentions to this young lady and me and our doctor.”<br><br>The doctor seemed to stare at her for a full minute before he spoke again. “Are you the patient’s mother?”<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>“Do you believe your daughter needs medical or psychiatric treatment?”<br><br>Thelma moved her head slowly in a nod and waited for the doctor to speak. His voice was very calm and monotone as he replied, “I believe your daughter may need medical treatment, but not psychiatric therapy at this time. I recommend that she be seen at the local hospital , where we can give her medical attention and keep her under sedation until the medication starts to take effect.”<br><br>Thelma pulled her body straighter and showed no emotion on her face. “We will provide those services here, Doctor.”<br><br>The doctor shook his head slowly. “I cannot recommend that course of action. I believe it would be in the best interest of your daughter for her to be seen by a specialist at the hospital in Raleigh.”<br><br>Thelma nodded slowly and lowered her head.  “You will cooperate with us, Doctor. If you don’t, I will have you dismissed from this hospital and never allow you to practice medicine again in this county. I am an officer of the law and know how these matters are handled.”<br><br>Timothy Jenks stood and walked swiftly to the door. He opened it and stepped out into the hall. Thelma followed quickly. “Come with me, young lady,” she said as she led Julia out the door.<br><br>Thelma walked silently down the corridor and stopped in front of a closed door. They turned to look at Julia. She was trembling on the verge of panic. “Don’t worry, honey. It will be okay,” Thelma said as she entered the room and closed the door behind her. She walked to the bed and sat on the edge beside Julia.<br><br>Julia looked up at Thelma and started to cry. “What are they going to do with me, Mama?”<br><br>Thelma’s expression changed from one of seething anger to that of a loving mother. She walked slowly to Julia, put her arms around her, and held her close. “Oh, honey. I’m sorry. They are not going to do anything except listen to you and help you get well.”<br><br>“They? What do you mean? You mean they will just listen to me talk about this stuff? That’s all? ”<br><br>As she spoke, Thelma realized that Julia was thinking of going to a psychiatrist. She was relieved that the town doctor refused to heed Thelma’s request. Now, looking into her daughter’s face, she could see the fear and uncertainty that Julia was facing. “Yes, honey. They will listen to you and—“<br><br>Suddenly there was a sound at the door. Thelma turned and saw Karen Jones standing in the doorway of the bedroom. “The doctor wants to talk to you, Dr. Martin. They moved up your appointment.”<br><br>Thelma turned back around to face Julia and continued, “They moved up your appointment because I insisted they do so.” She smiled reassuringly at her daughter and then added, “They are going to  help you get well and I am sure everything will be fine.”<br><br>Julia hesitated, then asked, “So why are you crying?” Thelma turned away as the tears streamed down her face. Julia looked at Karen for understanding, but she had already gone back into the kitchen.<br><br>In the next few minutes, it became clear to Julia that more than one person in town was disturbed by the recent events. First, Julia’s friends avoided her, and when she spoke to them on the telephone they had little to say about anything. Then, one day a group of high school girls came by Julia’s house and began screaming at her.<br><br>“You are possessed by the devil! Get out of town! Go away! We don’t want you here anymore! Get out of town or we will kill you!” Julia was taken completely by surprise her and did not know how to react. She began crying uncontrollably.<br><br>Thelma came running out of the house with a pan in her hand, screaming at the girls to leave her daughter alone. Thelma then turned her attention back to Julia and said, “Julia, I’m so sorry. Please don’t cry. Just leave when you can and never come back here again. Please stop crying Julia, for my sake if not your own.”<br><br>Julia stood outside her house, crying and listening to the screams of the girls moving up the street. Finally, Julia left her house and ran as fast as she could into town. She ran until she could no longer run. She found herself at the town square, collapsed on the grass crying and gasping for air. She was breathing so heavily that it was difficult for her to speak, but Julia managed to say, “I don’t know what’s happening to me. I don’t think I can stay here anymore. Please help me! Please do something! Please make this stop!”<br><br>Julia did not know what else to say. She was exhausted and out of breath. Julia felt alone and scared. Julia sat in the town square, surrounded by trees and empty benches, and cried. Julia cried because she was scared, because she felt alone, because she did not know how to fix what was happening to her, and because she just did not want to feel this way",1
"The group must overcome obstacles such as hunger, thirst, and the dangers of the outside world in order to escape.","<br><br>	“Maybe he escaped…” he said, looking around the room. “Or maybe he’s still in here…”<br><br>	I looked around the room for him for a few more seconds, but couldn’t see him anywhere.<br><br>	“He’s not anywhere in here…” I said, turning around to look at Brian. “We should probably go outside and see if we can find him.”<br><br>	We left the room, closing the door behind us, and walked out of the garage. We were standing there for a few minutes, looking around the grass for him, but he wasn’t anywhere in sight.<br><br>	“Maybe we should have looked for him before we came right out here…” Brian said, looking at me. “I mean, what if he is still inside that room? You know how dangerous it is for him to be inside there with us.”<br><br>	“Maybe…” I said, looking around the lawn again. “But I doubt he could have gotten out. He was only in the room for a few seconds. And I searched the room before we left, and he wasn’t anywhere in it.”<br><br>	“Well, where could he have gone?” Brian asked me, looking at the house. “There’s only one way out of this place, and he couldn’t have gotten out on his own.”<br><br>	I looked towards the house, wondering how he could have gotten out, but was stopped from saying anything else when I heard the door from the garage being opened.<br><br>	The door from the garage was opened all the way, and I could see out into the open garage, but we weren’t sure if there was anyone in it or not because we couldn’t see anyone in it.<br><br>	I walked to the door, and opened it a few inches to look out into the garage, but I still couldn’t see anyone in it.<br><br>	“There’s nobody in here…” I said, turning around to look at Brian. “I think he’s gone.”<br><br>	I closed the door, and turned around, walking back towards Brian when I heard something behind me.<br><br>	Something was walking out of the garage, and it was coming towards me. I turned around just in time to see it, and I screamed.<br><br>	It was a man! He was coming towards me! And he wasn’t wearing any clothes!<br><br>	I screamed again, and ran to the garage door, trying to close it. But the man was in front of it, and he moved out of the way just as I was about to close it.<br><br>	“Hello!” he said, smiling at me. “How are you?”<br><br>	“What the hell are you doing in here?!” I asked him, backing away from him. “Get out of here!”<br><br>	“Well…” he said, turning around for a second, looking at the garage door. “I was just going to look for that new guy. We haven’t seen him for a few hours now…”<br><br>	“Well, we’ve been out here for a few minutes already, and he was here when we got back…” I said, looking at him. “You know how dangerous it is for you to be in here with us. You could get sick.”<br><br>	“Oh no! I don’t think so!” he replied, turning around to look at me. “I hope I don’t get sick! Because I really don’t want that to happen to me.”<br><br>	“I don’t understand!” I said, shouting. “Why are you in here? Where is the new guy? Are you still looking for him?!”<br><br>	“Yes! Yes, I am! But why are you so concerned about where he is?” he asked me. “Have you seen him?”<br><br>	I turned away from the man, and started to walk towards where Brian was standing, but the man grabbed my arm.<br><br>	“Yes!” he replied, looking at me. “I have seen him!”<br><br>	Brian and I walked back towards the garage door, and Brian opened it back up so he could look out into the garage again. He scanned for a few seconds, but there was still nobody in it.<br><br>	“Where did he go?” Brian asked, looking at me as he closed the door again. “He was right here a second ago…”<br><br>	“I don’t know, Brian!” I replied. “But as soon as he saw that man, he ran away from us, and we haven’t seen him since.”<br><br>	“You know what?” Brian said, turning around to look at me. “He probably just went off to do his own thing. I mean, he’s a grown man. He can do whatever he wants. We can’t tell him what to do, you know?”<br><br>	“I know that!” I replied, turning around to look at him. “But I just think it’s weird that he ran away from us like that. Especially because we just met him today!”<br><br>	“He’s probably just upset because we won’t let him do what he wants to do,” Brian replied, smiling at me. “He’ll be back. Maybe he went for a walk or something.”<br><br>	I nodded at him, and we walked into the kitchen. We were both hungry, and we needed to get something to eat as soon as possible.

The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"After that, I just need you to focus on getting better now.”<br><br>Lisa stood up at this point and walked into the other room to collect Daisy’s notebook. She returned to her chair and opened up the notebook. The first few pages were dedicated to instructions on how their family was going to take care of things while she was away, and the last few pages contained some words of wisdom that she wanted her children to read after they got over the initial shock of her passing.<br><br>Just before she started reading, Lisa stopped and held the notebook up for a moment, considering her words. “You know, maybe I shouldn’t read this part of the notebook to them.”<br><br>“Oh? Why not?”<br><br>“It might be too much to handle at one time. It might be too much for them to process all at once.”<br><br>Lisa stopped to consider that point for a moment, then looked up at Daisy. “Can I just tell them some things right now, and read the rest of the words later?”<br><br>“Of course. Whatever you think is best for your children. But there are some things that I have written down that I would like them to hear before I pass on.”<br><br>Lisa nodded her head and settled back into her chair. “Okay, well first, they should know that you wrote about how proud you were of them. Both the way they have dealt with this so far, and the way they have taken care of everything at home while I’m at the hospital with you. You talked a lot about how much confidence you had in them to do the job, even when I wasn’t here. You said that you thought Lisa was ready to handle almost everything, and that she was ready to take over the business if she ever had to. And you were also very proud of both of them for all their hard work in school. You said that you had a good feeling about the direction they were headed.” Lisa paused at this point, but she could see in Daisy’s eyes that she was still fully awake and listening. “I’m not sure when they should know about the other parts, though,” she continued. “You talked about some important things that will affect them when I’m gone. There were things that we need to talk about as a family. ”<br><br>At this point, Daisy’s eyelids began to flutter a little bit and she gasped for air. Lisa looked over at the nurse at the desk and made some hand gestures, which got her attention. The nurse came over and checked Daisy’s vital signs before looking back at Lisa and nodding. “It’s probably just a side effect from these injections,” she explained. “She might need some oxygen for a few minutes, but she should be fine. Give her a second to rest and then try to talk again.”<br><br>Lisa nodded and put the side of her hand on Daisy’s forehead to check her temperature. “I should have brought your hat,” she said as she thought about what else might be troubling Daisy.<br><br>“Is it going to be all right?” Daisy asked in a groggy voice. “Are you going to be there when everything happens?”<br><br>Lisa tried to speak through her own nervousness. “Of course I will be there,” she assured Daisy and then moved closer to listen as the nurse explained what was happening. “I think you might be getting a little bit of a fever,” she said as she took Daisy’s pulse. “They just need to give you some oxygen and we should be on our way again soon. You have been such a trooper,” the nurse continued before turning to Lisa and adding, “You’ve been doing a terrific job of taking care of her. She’s got a great family. I know she will be fine.”<br><br>Lisa tried to control her breathing and nodded in response. “As soon as they give you the okay, I’ll go sit with my mom in the waiting room. She’s already told me all the things she wanted me to know if something happened,” she said before the nurse could interrupt.<br><br>Daisy opened her eyes and slowly turned her head toward Lisa. “Thank you for being there for all of us today,” she said. “I know it hasn’t been easy for you, but if there is any way I can repay you someday, just let me know.”<br><br>Lisa reached out a hand and brought it to her lips in response. “I don’t want to talk  about that just yet. I just want to get through today and see how things look in the morning. After we talk to the doctor tomorrow, I’ll have a better idea of what we need to do after you leave here.”<br><br>When Lisa turned back toward Daisy, her eyes were filled with tears. The nurse stepped up beside them and wiped her hand on a tissue before reaching out to touch Daisy’s arm.<br><br>“Mrs. Mayberry, I think your daughter is worn out and needs to go home for a little while before coming back this evening. She has been such a help today and really been an inspiration to many of the other patients. I know she is a special person, but her strength today has been so uplifting to everyone here.”<br><br>Daisy nodded in agreement as the nurse spoke. “I think she should go home too. She gets up early every day, comes to take care of me, and then gets back here before dark to do whatever I need her to do. If you don’t mind, I would like her to stay here with me tonight. I want us to talk for a while before she goes home.”<br><br>Lisa glanced over at her and smiled weakly, but it was obvious that the emotional strain from the day was now starting to show. As they stood up and started walking toward the door, Lisa reached out and squeezed her mom’s hand. “I know you are tired, but I’m glad you are staying here tonight. I really want to talk about this afternoon and what happened in my office.”<br><br>“Me too,” Daisy said as she squeezed her hand back. “I think you should get some rest though because I want to tell you all about it while it is still fresh in my mind.”<br><br>They both smiled at one another as they walked out of the room and started down the hall toward Lisa’s office. There was a sudden explosion of activity around them as nurses and doctors scurried to and fro with charts, medicine carts, equipment, and other assorted paraphernalia. However, the commotion abruptly ended as they entered the hallway and walked by without a glance at them.<br><br>In the quiet of the hallway, they made their way down to Lisa’s office and took seats across from each other on her sofa. “Okay,  tell me everything you know about this trial,” Lisa said as she picked up her laptop and began turning it on.<br><br>Daisy sighed heavily as she sat back in the love seat and pulled her feet up underneath her. She pulled both hands through her hair in frustration, and then started talking. “I really don’t know much about it except that the doctor said it is an experimental treatment for people with the particular type of lung cancer I have. He told me that he was sending me to Memorial Hospital in St. Louis for an evaluation before I could be enrolled in the trial. He said he had been contacted by a research committee at the hospital and that they would meet me and evaluate me. I’m supposed to leave tomorrow at noon,” she said as she leaned back and covered her eyes with her hand.<br><br>Lisa sat behind her desk and folded her hands in front of her. “That’s great news! It will be such a relief to have you out of the house and somewhere where I can drop by whenever I need to. You’ve become too difficult to deal with lately,” she said. She quickly added, “I don’t mean that as an insult.”<br><br>Daisy looked at Lisa and smiled. “I know you didn’t mean it as an insult. I have been difficult to deal with lately, but maybe now that I am leaving for a while it will give you some rest and you won’t feel so overwhelmed. Maybe it will also relieve Bill of some of the stress he’s been under,” she said. They both sat silently for a moment before Daisy continued, “I think this could be the answer to our problems. I could come through this and we wouldn’t have to worry so much about where the money is going to come from. We could be financially secure again. And, as we used to say in school…it will be like having found the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.”<br><br>“I agree,” said Lisa. She then added, “But what about me? How do I know that you’re going to come through this and be fine? What if it doesn’t work out and you die anyway? How can I go on living without you? You’re all I have. Who is going to take care of me",1

And as you might recall, Ratzenberger also played the character of Cliff Clavin on Cheers, and he even turned up in the Muppet Show episode “The Muppets Go to a Party.”<br><br>It’s also a very strange premise to base an episode of a children’s show on, which makes it all the more delightful — this is exactly the kind of thing that you never would have gotten away with during the original run of the Muppet Babies, but now, they can give it a bit of an edge without losing any audience.<br><br>I’m not saying this will be great television, but I do think that the Muppet Babies need to take more chances like this. So let’s get started, shall we?<br><br>Yep — that’s right, the opening theme song has been replaced by a new hip-hop version. So much for the original theme song! (And why does Miss Piggy sound like a man in this version?!)<br><br>This episode is called “Top Notch,” which is a pun on top-notch education, and what do I see in the opening scene?<br><br>That’s right — they’re doing a parody of that old classic, “Schoolhouse Rock.” (And I’m pretty sure that the “Three Is a Magic Number” riff is a take-off on “Three Is a Magic Number,” which is the only one that has ever had any significance in my life.)<br><br>And I also see what appears to be the entire cast of the original “Schoolhouse Rock” series, including Bob Dorough, the guy who did all the original songs. (And I like that they kept in the “Bob Dorough didn’t get paid anything for his work on Schoolhouse Rock” part.)<br><br>We then see John Ratzenberger teaching that three is a magic number, and apparently he’s a substitute teacher for Miss Piggy’s class.<br><br>So Kermit comes in and introduces everyone to Mr. Ratzenberger, who says that he’s “the greatest educator in the universe” — and that’s even before he starts singing about how great it is to be",0
"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","Jenna Riley stood in the doorway of her family’s blue bungalow, sipping on a cold glass of milk. The air was warm and humid, and Jenna felt heavy in the muggy heat. She had worked the midnight shift at the diner all night long, and it was now four in the morning. Jenna was exhausted from working, and she wished that she could go home to her apartment soon. She passed a few other people on the sidewalk on her way home. They all wore clothes that were too warm for how humid it was outside that early in the morning. Jenna stopped to chat with one of her coworkers. Jenna wished that she worked during the day shift, like him. It would be easier on her body and easier for her to do errands during the day, rather than at night. She would have to wait until after ten thirty before she could go home and rest. She had time for a quick nap  before she had to leave for work again.<br><br>Jenna was carrying a big brown bag of books in one hand and her keys in the other as she walked down the street. She stopped to look at a flyer about a community event. As she was looking through the pages, someone grabbed her shoulder and spun her around behind her. The mugger pressed his hand over her mouth and pulled out a gun.<br><br>“Do anything stupid,” he warned, “and I’ll shoot you in the head and leave you in this alley, just like your friend.”<br><br>He was talking about the poor girl who had been found murdered in the alley behind the diner a few weeks ago. Jenna had often walked through that same alley on her way home from work. She wished that she hadn’t been too tired this morning to walk a different route.<br><br>Jenna tried to scream, but the mugger clamped his hand tighter over her mouth. When he let go of her shoulder, Jenna took advantage and ran for the doors of the library across the street. There were several people inside, working on their laptops or sitting in cozy chairs reading magazines.<br><br>“Help!” Jenna shouted, but the people either looked up from their work or kept reading. No one bothered to come out and help her.<br><br>The mugger ran up to her, grabbed at the bag of books she was holding, and screamed, “Give me your stupid books! Now!”<br><br>Jenna dropped the plastic-wrapped books, but the mugger tripped on his own feet, allowing Jenna to escape. As he stood up, he pulled out a gun and pointed it at Jenna.<br><br>Jenna knew that she couldn’t outrun him.<br><br>“Get over here or I’ll blow your brains out,” the mugger barked.<br><br>Jenna stepped closer to the man, giving him no other choice but to pull the trigger. When a shot rang out, Jenna instinctively ducked and found herself on the ground. It felt like her cheek was burning, but she couldn’t be sure.<br><br>The mugger laughed and knelt down next to her. “You made it easy for me, bitch,” he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette lighter. He looked down at Jenna  and smiled. “When I’m done with you, you won’t be able to walk home from your shift at the diner anymore.”<br><br>The mugger stood up and ignited the lighter. Jenna closed her eyes and felt a sharp pain in her face as the mugger pressed the hot end of the lighter against Jenna’s cheek. She heard a sizzle and when she opened her eyes, she saw the mugger staring at her.<br><br>Jenna sat up and coughed, blood spewing out of her mouth. She looked around and saw the mugger lighting another cigarette;  he was still sitting on the ground next to her. Jenna screamed as loud as she could and lunged forward at the mugger, knocking him off balance. The mugger fell backwards and screamed in pain as he fell onto some broken glass.<br><br>Jenna stood up, but was too weak to get very far. She stumbled to the other side of the alley and collapsed against a wall. She looked down at her hands and saw that they were covered in blood. Her shirt was also stained with blood, and she could feel it slowly seeping into her jeans.<br><br>The mugger got back to his feet and turned around; he was holding the lighter as if preparing for another attack. Jenna’s vision started to go dark, and she stumbled forward, trying to reach the diner. She reached her arms out as if to brace herself against the wall, but all she hit were cold bricks.<br><br>Jenna then felt a sharp sting in her side; she looked down and saw that she was bleeding profusely. She slowly sank to the ground, and began coughing up more blood. The mugger walked out of the alley after he saw that Jenna was lying motionless on the ground. He picked up his sunglasses from the ground and put them back on his face.<br><br>Jenna suddenly came to, and forced herself onto her knees. She heard sirens just outside the alley, and tried to crawl in the direction of the diner’s entrance. It was hard going, but she managed to make it to the door. She was about to use her hands to open it when she realized that her hand was completely covered in blood.<br><br>She then heard a voice, “It’s okay, just lean on me.” When she looked up, Damian Henchman was helping Jenna out behind the diner. Jenna coughed and spat out some blood onto the ground. She began coughing again, and then collapsed on the ground.<br><br>Jenna came to again, and this time, she found herself in a white-walled hospital room with a man in his mid twenties standing at her bedside. Jenna looked up at him, and noticed that he had long blond hair and blue eyes. His face was covered with deep, red scars. He wore a white shirt and pants that were tucked into black combat boots. He was holding Jenna’s hand, and stared back at her.",1
Mary Smith walks home from work and becomes the victim of a mugging attempt by John Doe.,"I remember when the mugging all started. Ever since I was a little girl, I had dreamed of being an artist. I used to take my crayons and pencils and draw pictures of fairies and unicorns in my coloring books. As I grew older, I began to explore other mediums, like sketching and painting, though I never felt comfortable with those forms of art. My true talent was sculpting. It was the only thing that gave me enough freedom and control to express myself.<br><br>	I was a young college graduate, and I still had not found a job in my field. With the bills piling up and no income, I had to take any job that I could find. It was so disappointing when I found out that the café that I was hired at was only going to pay me $2 an hour. The job paid well for a café, but it was a far cry from what I should be making. When I got home from work that day, my mood was as low as my bank account balance. As I paced back and forth in my studio, a knock on the door interrupted my thoughts.<br><br>I answered the door, only to find the landlord standing in the doorway. “Sorry to bother you,” he said, rather confused. “But there’s been a leak in the house that we’ve been trying to find for some time.”<br><br>“I’m so sorry! I bet I know what it is,” I said as I went to the water heater in the basement. The landlord followed me downstairs with a flashlight. As I turned the water heater toward him, the pipe that was leaking finally gave way and spewed water all over us.<br><br>“Oh, no! You are going to have to pay the plumber for this,” the landlord exclaimed.<br><br>“Let me go get my wallet, and I will pay for it right now,” I said as I ran up to my studio. I opened my wallet, but there were only a few dollars in it.<br><br>“It will be $50 to repair it, then. Oh well, at least you get yourself a new water heater out of this,” said the landlord as he handed me back my wallet.<br><br>“I would take care of it myself, but I don’t know how.”<br><br>“Well, at least you are getting something out of it.”<br><br>“I’ll let you know how much it is when I get the bill,” I said as I backed into my studio.<br><br>I sat on the couch and tried to figure out a way that I could pay for the repair. “If only I could get a job doing something that I was good at.”<br><br>That is when the idea of mugging came to my mind. I knew that I needed money, and I was looking for a way to get it without having to work for it. After a few minutes, I figured it all out. There were not many people in the alley, so it would be easy to catch someone off guard and steal their valuables. Then I would be able to pay for the repair to my water heater, and I would still have some money left over for myself.<br><br>I felt a bit guilty about my plan, but I did not see how else I was going to get the money that I needed. As I came up to my door, I slipped on my coat and hat and headed out into the alley.<br><br>      I was hiding behind a dumpster when I saw John Doe coming toward me. He had a few grocery bags in his hands, so it would be an easy job. I followed him to the end of the alley and waited for him to come to a stop. I got closer to him, but did not make any sudden moves.<br><br>      “Hello there,” I said as I slipped past him and went into the alley. Suddenly, he turned and pointed his finger at me. “What are you doing?” he said as he took a defensive stance.<br><br>“What does it look like? I’m trying to mug you,” I said as I fished out my knife from my purse. “Now hand over all of your valuables or else I will cut you,” I commanded.<br><br>     John Doe looked at me as if he didn’t know whether or not I was telling the truth. Then he took a step toward me, and I knew that I had to act fast. Just as he was about to lunge at me with his fist, I lunged forward with my blade. The blade cut through his shirt, but not his skin. As he backed away from me, I could tell that he was not afraid of me. He was going to try and take my knife away from me.<br><br>     I quickly pulled my blade back into its sheath and then took a defensive stance. I was amazed at how fast he was. I was not even sure that I saw him move, and the next thing that I knew he had my knife.<br><br>“Now what are you going to do?” he said as he held my knife in his hand.<br><br>“I guess it was not such a good idea after all,” I said as I began to cry. “I’m sorry. Let me go, and I will never do it again.”<br><br>     John Doe let go of my blade and then took a step backward. As soon as he let go of the blade, I quickly pulled it out of his hand. I then turned toward him and took another defensive stance. He looked at me as if he didn’t know whether or not he should attack me again.<br><br>As soon as he made up his mind to attack, I attacked him with my blade. It cut through his shirt, but not his skin. “Where is your knife?” I asked him once I pulled my blade out of his shirt",0

Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"this point.<br><br>I walked back up the stairs and decided to check out my new kitchen. I opened the cabinets and found a few pots and pans. I looked for a knife, but didn’t see one in any of them. I started looking around for something to cut my food with when I noticed my refrigerator.<br><br>I hadn’t really looked at the refrigerator before, but now that I did, I realized that it was full. Unfortunately, there was nothing in there that I recognized. I looked around for a few minutes, but couldn’t find anything to cook with.<br><br>I decided that it was too early in the morning to think about food, so I walked back into the living room and sat down on the couch. I picked up one of the video games and started playing.<br><br> -----<br><br>The next morning, I woke up with a headache. It wasn’t a bad headache, but it was certainly enough to make me feel the need to take a shower. As I got out of bed and walked across the living room, I noticed that there was an alarm clock on the coffee table. The clock read 11:00 in the morning, so I had spent at least a few hours sleeping in.<br><br>I walked into the bathroom and turned on the water. I looked through my medicine cabinet for some aspirin, but didn’t see any in there. I opened my medicine cabinet and found a few bottles of prescription pills, but none of them had aspirin listed on the bottle.<br><br>I stepped into the shower and let the hot water run over me. It felt great, and I was starting to feel a lot better. I got out of the shower and dried off before putting on some clothes.<br><br>I didn’t even have to think about what I was going to wear. When I was packing up my things to move out, I made sure that I packed all of the clothes I owned. There were at least five sets of clothes in my closet.<br><br>The only problem was that I still didn’t remember how to get into my apartment. Every time I thought about it, it just got me more confused. There had to be a door somewhere, but where?<br><br>I decided that it would be best to ask one of my neighbors about the doors in my apartment. I went down to the living room and started looking for one of them. I walked around for a few minutes, but didn’t see any doors. I started getting a little frustrated, and was ready to call a locksmith when I found a door.<br><br>The door was at the end of the room near the kitchen. I opened it up and found myself standing in a hallway. This hallway had a door to my left and another one across from it. As I walked down the hallway, I decided that I should probably try to find out what was on the other side of the first door. If I was lucky, it would be a closet and I would be able to change into something else.<br><br>I walked over to the door and opened it up.<br><br>I was shocked to see that I didn’t find myself in a closet at all. Instead, I found myself in a bedroom. It was completely empty, except for a bed. There weren’t any drawers or even a desk to be found. This room was completely bare.<br><br>I walked around the room for a few minutes, but couldn’t find anything in there that would help me get some clothes. I decided that I would just have to find out what was on the other side of the second door.<br><br>As I walked over to the other door, I couldn’t help but think about how strange it was that there was a bedroom in my apartment that I didn’t even know about. Who decided to put the bedroom there, and when? It seemed to be completely random.<br><br>I opened the door and walked into the room.<br><br>I was standing in a spare bedroom. The bed was made, and there were a few books on the nightstand. There were two doors in this room as well. One of them led to the bathroom that I had been using last night, and the other one led to what looked like an office. Behind the desk was a lamp and a few papers. There was also a computer sitting on the desk, but it was turned off.<br><br>I decided that I would look for the spare bedroom when I was done in here. It could be useful to have an extra room in my apartment, especially one that has a bed in it. I got out some clothes and started changing. As I was changing, I started to wonder if the spare bedroom had a closet. That would really be useful, since I only had one closet in my room that I could use for all of my clothes.<br><br>I put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt before walking over to the door that led to the bedroom. I opened it up and started looking for a closet. Just as I was about to give up, I saw it, tucked away in the corner of the room.<br><br>I quickly walked over to the closet and started to look for things that would fit. I was hoping that there would be a ton of hangers, but that wasn’t the case. There were only five hangers in the closet, and they were all full. Luckily, all of the clothes on there were clothes that I didn’t own.<br><br>I picked out the first shirt I saw and tossed it on the bed. It was a light blue shirt with “Frolic” written across it in capital letters. I didn’t think that shirt looked very good on me and decided to just keep looking. The next shirt I picked up was for a little kid, so I threw that back on the ground. The next one was a yellow shirt with a picture of a taco on it. I didn’t really like that one either, so I kept looking.<br><br>The next shirt was red with a picture of a fish on it. It seemed like an obvious choice, so I grabbed it and put it",0
Natalie goes to the police and helps them apprehend Trevor Lockwood before he can hurt anyone else .,"that month, Trevor Lockwood cleared his throat and changed the subject. “So, um, since we have our business out of the way…”<br><br>“You don’t have to worry about my rent anymore!” Natalie said, excited that another problem had been solved. She moved her legs around and leaned closer to Trevor Lockwood so that their shoulders were touching. She looked up at him with a coy smile.<br><br>The police station was located just a few blocks from Trevor Lockwood’s apartment building. The ride in the back of the squad car was short and when they arrived, Natalie was escorted into an interrogation room with a camera above the one-way mirror.<br><br>Natalie sat down on a small chair and looked over at the Detectives sitting across from her. Detectives Johnson and Lassiter of the Seattle Police Department. <br><br>“So, why don’t you tell us what happened?” Detective Johnson asked.<br><br>“I went to meet Trevor Lockwood at his apartment, but it was obvious that something was off about him. He wouldn’t stop staring at my chest and it kinda creeped me out.”<br><br>“Didn’t you report this already? Why are you telling us again?” Detective Lassiter asked.<br><br>Natalie was about to reply when the room filled with a familiar scent. The smell of coffee and bacon, her favorite combination for breakfast.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood walked in and set a plate of food down on the table in front of her.<br><br>“For the love of God, Trevor Lockwood! What do you want from me?”<br><br>Trevor moved closer to her and whispered in her ear. <br><br>“I want you, Natalie Harper.”<br><br>Natalie stood up and pushed him away. The detectives looked over at the two of them before they were startled by a loud banging on the door. They all turned around to see who was there, only to find Trevor standing outside with a knife in his hand.<br><br>“I have your money now, Natalie Harper, and I’m not afraid to use it.”<br><br>Detective Johnson took out his gun and pointed it at Trevor Lockwood. He shook his head in disbelief as he continued to point the gun at him.<br><br>“You can’t come in here with that knife, you crazy son of a bitch! Get out of here or I’ll shoot!”<br><br>Detective Lassiter moved between the two of them and tried to calm them down.<br><br>“Put the gun down, Detective Johnson! We don’t want to escalate this situation any further than it already is! If we take this any further, we could all be in danger. We need to figure out how to diffuse it first. Do you have a warrant?”<br><br>Detective Johnson shook his head.<br><br>“I don’t have a warrant but I do have probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. I’m here to arrest an individual for attempted murder.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter took them into the main police station. They sat down at a long table and Detective Johnson ordered everyone, including the secretaries and other detectives, to leave the room.<br><br>“Now, Detective Johnson, tell me what happened? Who did you come here to arrest? Did this person do something wrong?”<br><br>Detective Lassiter looked at the two policemen in front of him, waiting for one of them to speak up. One of them spoke first.<br><br>“Yes, we have a warrant out for a man named Trevor Lockwood. We think he may be responsible for the disappearance of five young women.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter did a quick internet search on his phone and then sat back in his chair.<br><br>“Wait, this is the same man that you came here to arrest? The one that just arrived here as well? The one who came here to… what exactly did you  say he was here to do? Did he come here to talk with you about something?”<br><br>Detective Johnson opened the folder with documentation for Trevor Lockwood. He handed it across the table to Detective Lassiter.<br><br>“His records indicate that he came here to speak with our witness, so we could arrest him.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter flipped through a few pages and then looked up at the two policemen.<br><br>“Wait, this says here that he is a serial killer?”<br><br>Detective Johnson nodded.<br><br>“That is correct. He has lured five young women to their deaths in the past three years. We believe he tried to lure our witness here today, but that she refused to go with him and instead came here to the police station where we were able to apprehend him.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter continued flipping through pages of paperwork before standing up.<br><br>“Where is this man now? We need to move fast to make an arrest.”<br><br>The two detectives explained that he was in a holding cell in the courthouse. Detective Lassiter left to make arrangements.<br><br>Detective Johnson looked down at the file on his lap and then back up at me.<br><br>“Are you ready to move forward with your statement?”<br><br>I nodded. “Yes, of course! I just need a few minutes though, if that’s okay with you.”<br><br>The two detectives agreed. I exited the room and moved to the side staircase and began climbing. When I reached the fourth floor, I entered an empty courtroom and sat down in front of the large window that overlooked Main Street. It was quiet and peaceful here, but it wouldn’t be for long. I moved to the front of the room and took a seat at the witness stand.<br><br>The courtroom door opened and Detective Johnson walked in. He closed the door behind him and turned to face me as he walked toward the witness stand.<br><br>“No problem, I understand that you just  went through something very traumatic. Take all the time you need to compose yourself. We can keep this quick and easy if you like, or we can take our time…whatever works for you.”<br><br>“It would be good to get this over with so I can begin putting my life back together.”<br><br>Detective Johnson nodded and then walked over to a wooden chair sitting directly in front of the witness stand. He sat down and then paused for a moment before speaking.<br><br>“I have a few questions I need to ask you that will help us move forward, but first I need you to meet someone.”<br><br>“Okay, who is it?”<br><br>Detective Johnson reached into his pocket and removed a piece of paper from inside his wallet. After unfolding the paper he handed it to me, and then moved closer to me.<br><br>“This is a picture of Trevor Lockwood,” he said as he pointed at the photograph. “This man is wanted by the police for multiple counts of kidnapping and murder. According to your statement, you are the latest in a long list of women who went missing under similar circumstances.”<br><br>He moved back to the wooden chair and placed his hands behind his head.<br><br>“The details of the crimes vary in each case, but they all follow the same pattern: The women agreed to meet a handsome man on a certain date after speaking with him online, but when they arrive at the location given by the man they were never heard from again. We have five instances where this exact scenario took place, and in all cases the women went to that location, but never came back.”<br><br>The detective moved closer to me, then continued talking.<br><br>“Lockwood would go to the location where the transactions were supposed to take place, but when a woman arrived there he would either move the location or have one of his accomplices do it. In all cases, no trace of any of these women was ever found again. We have gone to the locations Lockwood has been listed at, but all traces of him were long gone.”<br><br>He moved back to the chair and straightened his tie.<br><br>“The reason why we moved so quickly in this instance is that one of our informers said that Lockwood had been planning to lure yet another woman to her death, and that he had been bragging about it online. We were able to track him down and arrest him before he could carry out his plan.”<br><br>The detective paused for a moment, then looked at me.<br><br>“So, you see, Miss Harper, you are very lucky to be alive.”<br><br>I nodded in understanding, then asked the question that had been on my mind since I had first heard about this case.<br><br>“Detective, why do you think Trevor Lockwood did this?”<br><br>The detective leaned back in his chair and sighed.<br><br>“That, Miss Harper, is something that we may never know for sure. But I have my theories.”",1
The world ends in a cataclysmic event.,"One day, the world just ended.<br><br>    The sky turned red and the ground shook. Everyone knew it was the end for all of them. The lights went out, the electricity left, along with the running water and all other necessities that people took for granted. The world ended.<br><br>And then it started again. A flash of green light and a brilliant white sound filled the sky as if the world was being zapped clean. And then it happened again. And again.<br><br>And suddenly, everything was ok again in the world, but darker than before. Some said that heaven came to earth and wiped the world clean, and that everything would be fine from now on. But that didn’t really explain why there was so much darkness afterwards. Why it seemed darker than before. Why the world seemed smaller somehow, like a smaller version of itself. Why people kept seeing ghosts everywhere and zombies, and demons and all kinds of creatures that should have died in the cataclysm that had just happened.<br><br>The world was ending again, but this time for real. The blackness in the world was spreading. Soon everything would be gone forever. The end of the world had come for real this time .<br><br>The sun gave way to the blackness, and in the middle of it all, was a huge ring of light that shone brightly from all over the earth. It came out of nowhere, and there was no explanation for it whatsoever. But everyone knew what it was. And they knew it meant the end of the world was finally here.<br><br>As the sky got darker, and then darker still, and the ring of light turned into a circle of light that seemed to emanate from the ground beneath them, darkness finally fell over everything. All of nature went silent. The birds stopped singing, grass stopped growing, flowers stopped blooming, trees stopped leafing. Rivers and streams dried up.<br><br>And then the sky turned red.<br><br>The whole sky turned red, like the color of blood. And the ground shook violently beneath them as all of nature was overcome with a terrible heat that seemed to come from below their feet.  So people ran away in terror, everyone trying to get as far away from each other as possible. Everyone ran for their own lives as fast as they possibly could, not knowing what would happen next, nor where they would run to. They just knew they had to get away from others as fast as possible before the end came upon them.<br><br>The people were in such a terrible state of panic and confusion, that when Maria Martinez tried to ask the others what was going on, no one paid any attention to her. All they could think of was getting away from everyone else and somewhere safe, and so they all ignored her. Maria  ran around in circles for a while trying to figure out what was happening and where to go, but it was hopeless.<br><br>“I don’t know what to do! What should I do?” she cried out desperately into the night air as she ran around in circles on the plaza. The sun disappeared behind a wall of flames that burned its way across the horizon like a fiery river and plunged the world into darkness. It was now pitch black and eerie shadows danced all around as if some otherworldly creatures were playing tricks on them.<br><br>Maria felt so frightened that she was shaking uncontrollably, but she  didn’t have much time to think, because the ground started to crumble and buildings collapsed as the earth shook violently beneath their feet. Everyone began screaming and trying to run away as fast as they could, not knowing what was causing this, or where to go.  Maria could hear the sound of glass breaking and the distant, terrified screams of her neighbors as she ran through the streets just like everyone else.<br><br>Maria looked up at the night sky and saw a bright light shining down from it. It spread its beams out across the landscape like a million tiny spotlights, illuminating everything in sight. Everything looked different now, as if it was lit up by some weird light that didn’t belong there. Suddenly, the sky went dark again and it seemed as if a hole had opened in the Earth from which they could see far below them. The moon disappeared and the stars vanished from the sky, plunging the world into darkness. Then the ground fractured and an enormous crack spread from horizon to horizon, swallowing up everything in its path.<br><br>The sky faded to red as fire engulfed the world. Finally, the light faded and everything went silent once more. Then a blinding flash of white fire burst forth, engulfing the sky.<br><br>The ground crumbled and opened up, swallowing up not only the sky but everything in sight. Trees, buildings, cars; all disappeared like dust in a rainstorm. Everything except for one lone building which stood unharmed at the center of all this chaos; untouched by the chaos  that engulfed everything else.<br><br>Cars and bodies flew through the air like dust in the wind. When they landed, they scattered across the land like seeds from a bomb blast. The people who had once lived and worked there were forced to watch their homes, their friends and family die before their eyes; right before they were swallowed up by the ground below.<br><br>The ground crumbled and split apart as if it too was dying. Then, with a loud crash and a thunderous roar, everything stopped. The land fell silent again, as if nothing had ever happened at all. In the distant void of space, where the ground had shattered, a dark figure was standing on top of a stone pillar. It raised up its massive black arm, opening its mouth and sending out a beam of white fire that shot into the sky. Its mouth opened wider as it swallowed the whole world …<br><br>… and nothing else was left.",1

Preservatives are used primarily in cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations.

Gabriel moves out of his parents' house and into his own apartment.,"As the day approached when Gabriel was to move out of his parents’ house, he began thinking about how it would feel to be alone without them. He was going to be in charge of everything, and all his life he had been in charge of very little.<br><br>He would have to buy groceries, cook meals, pay bills. He would have to take out the garbage, and clean the bathroom. He would have to do all these things for himself.<br><br>And this was just what his parents wanted for him. They had worked hard all their lives so that he could move out of their house and become his own person.<br><br>Gabriel Martin, who was 24 years old, moved out of the parental home to start an independent life on his own.

Daisy ultimately beats cancer and her story inspires hope in her community.,"love with her.<br><br>	She smiled at me and looked away for a second as she bit her lip. “Nick,” she started. “I really appreciate everything you’ve done for me and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.”<br><br>	I stopped myself before I replied and thought about what she had just said. “Melissa, you don’t have to thank me,” I replied.<br><br>	She looked at me and smiled as she touched my hand. “I know, but I want to thank you,” she replied. “You’re the only reason I have made it this far and you are always so nice to me. I just want you to know that I appreciate everything you do for me.”<br><br>	I smiled at her and got a little bit of chills run up my spine. “Melissa…” I started, but she interrupted me before I could finish my sentence.<br><br>	She stared at me and smiled as she gently touched my cheek. “Thank you, Nick,” she said softly.<br><br>	I closed my eyes and I felt myself get lost for a few seconds in her beautiful blue eyes. The next thing I knew, she was kissing me. It was a soft little kiss, but it still felt so good.<br><br>	When we broke the kiss, she gave me a little smile and then looked away for a second. “I’m sorry about that,” she said.<br><br>	I smiled and shook my head. “Don’t be,” I replied. “I enjoyed it. I’m just not used to that from you is all.”<br><br>	She bit her lip and smiled at me as she stared into my eyes. “You’re so beautiful, Nick,” she whispered.<br><br>	She was such a sweet woman and I loved her so much. I knew that she felt the same way about me, but I just didn’t think it was the best thing for us to be together. I mean, what kind of life would we have if we stayed together?<br><br>	She gently touched my cheek again and I felt myself get lost in her beautiful green eyes again. I did love her more than anything, but she was so good to me. She had done so much for me and I didn’t want to hurt her, but part of me was telling me that I needed to tell her the truth.<br><br>	“You’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen,” I replied.<br><br>	She smiled and kissed me lightly on the lips. “Thank you,” she whispered.<br><br>	I suddenly felt a cold chill run through my body and I started to shiver. My head hurt, but I didn’t understand why.<br><br>	Melissa looked at me and frowned. “Are you cold?” she asked.<br><br>	I nodded my head and closed my eyes as I tried to control my shivering.<br><br>	“It is a little chilly out here,” she replied as she touched my hand. “Why don’t you come on inside and you can get in bed for a while.”<br><br>	I tried to talk to her, but I couldn’t because I started to feel dizzy. It was like someone was squeezing my head too tight and I could feel the pain in the back of my head.<br><br>	“Nick, are you okay?” she asked with a worried expression on her face.<br><br>	Before I could reply, I felt myself black out.<br><br>	When I woke up, I was lying in my bed and it was dark outside. I wondered what had happened, but I didn’t remember anything.<br><br>	I sat up in bed and looked around. “Emma?” I called out.<br><br>	The room was silent and I didn’t hear anything. My heart started to race as I quickly got out of bed.<br><br>	I stumbled for a moment, but then I leaned against the wall for support. “Emma?” I called out again, but still there was no answer.<br><br>	I started to panic as I heard footsteps coming down the hall. “Emma?” I called out and I noticed that we were walking through our kitchen.<br><br>	Suddenly, the lights were turned on and I looked around in confusion. I frowned as I realized that my father was staring at me with a look of concern on his face.<br><br>	“Nick?” he asked.<br><br>	I didn’t know what to say, so I just stared at him in confusion. There was a moment of silence before my father spoke again.<br><br>	“What happened, Nick?” he asked as he walked over to me.<br><br>	 I felt a lump in my throat as I thought about how I could avoid telling him the truth.<br><br>	“I don’t know,” I replied.<br><br>	My father raised one of his eyebrows at me and tilted his head. “You don’t know?” he asked. “You just collapsed in the middle of your date with Melissa and were unconscious for the past twenty minutes. What do you think happened?”<br><br>	“I don’t know, Dad,” I replied as I shook my head.<br><br>	My father grabbed my shoulders and sat me down on a chair. “Nick, you’re going to have to tell me what happened. I want to help you, but you’re going to have to trust me and let me know what’s going on.”<br><br>	I stared at him, trying to find a way out of this. Why did he have to be so perceptive?<br><br>	He sat down next to me and stared into my eyes. “Tell me what happened, Nick?”<br><br>	I sighed and looked away from him. I didn’t want to tell",0
A group of survivors find themselves holed up in an old house in the middle of nowhere.,"For weeks, the group had been holed up in the old house. They were all tired of being inside, but the woods outside were dangerous. The woods harbored plenty of animals, and the thought that a rabid wolf or bear could run into the house was still enough to make them afraid. They had found a way to block all of the doors except for the front door, but they were still afraid of what might be outside.<br><br>There was no food left in the back of the house, and they had already eaten all of their food. They needed to find more food in order to survive. They must think of ways to get out of the house in order to stay alive.<br><br>The group had stayed together out of necessity, but they did not know each other very well. They had spent every day together after their escape from the hospital, but they did not really know each other that well. They knew that staying alive was easier if they stayed together.<br><br>In the beginning of the group’s stay in the house, there had been tension among them, but eventually they overcame their differences and started working together, despite disagreements over what to do on occasion. They must learn how to work together in order to stay alive .<br><br>They did not know much about each other at all, and they knew that there were certain things that they could say to each other without starting unnecessary arguments. They needed to discuss how the group was going to move forward in order to survive.<br><br>Jennifer would think about her father from time to time, and try to learn as much as she could from the others about what had happened. If they learned how to work together for their mutual benefit, they could learn a lot of valuable information that would help them stay alive.<br><br>Stephanie knew that she would never be able to trust Jennifer completely; after all,  she had made a move on her boyfriend, and then lied about it. But if Jennifer showed an interest in working with the group as a whole, and proved trustworthy, Stephanie might be able to put aside her differences with her.<br><br>She waited until after breakfast—which was an egg omelet—to broach the subject.<br><br>“Who’s going out to get fish?” Stephanie asked, sitting in front of the fire with Jennifer and Johnathan Hill. The group had found a couple dozen fish in a lake nearby, but they needed more. They needed fresh protein, something that could sustain the group for a few weeks at least.<br><br>The group needed to find a source of freshwater, something that would provide them with clean water for drinking and bathing.<br><br>“I’ll go find some fresh water,” Johnathan said,  standing and stretching.<br><br>“I’ll take you,” Jennifer said, jumping up as well. “We can walk through the woods nearby, and maybe we can find a stream or something.”<br><br>Stephanie rolled her eyes and turned back to the fire.<br><br>“You’re not a great fighter,” she said, turning toward Jennifer. “And it would be very helpful if you stay here and protected the rest of us. If you leave, I don’t know what will happen to the rest of us. You could die out there, and we’d be all alone and defenseless. If we get attacked while you’re gone, what are we supposed to do? Just lie down and die? We need someone here watching over us at all times so that doesn’t happen.”<br><br>Stephanie had a point. Jennifer looked back at Stephanie with a small smile of agreement. She did need to stay with the rest of the group as much as possible. There were more than enough weapons in the house to protect them, and if anyone came near the house, they’d be able to hear it.<br><br>“I’m sorry, I know I said that I wanted to go, but you’re right. We can’t risk losing any of us, especially me. Alright? I won’t go.”<br><br>Stephanie nodded. “Okay, good. You just stay here and watch over the rest of us while we’re sleeping. I don’t want anyone getting hurt.”<br><br>Jennifer nodded in agreement again, and Stephanie went back to the fire to keep Willow company while she",1
Natalie goes to the police and helps them apprehend Trevor Lockwood before he can hurt anyone else .,"that month, Trevor Lockwood cleared his throat and changed the subject. “So, um, since we have our business out of the way…”<br><br>“You don’t have to worry about my rent anymore!” Natalie said, excited that another problem had been solved. She moved her legs around and leaned closer to Trevor Lockwood so that their shoulders were touching. She looked up at him with a coy smile.<br><br>The police station was located just a few blocks from Trevor Lockwood’s apartment building. The ride in the back of the squad car was short and when they arrived, Natalie was escorted into an interrogation room with a camera above the one-way mirror.<br><br>Natalie sat down on a small chair and looked over at the Detectives sitting across from her. Detectives Johnson and Lassiter of the Seattle Police Department. <br><br>“So, why don’t you tell us what happened?” Detective Johnson asked.<br><br>“I went to meet Trevor Lockwood at his apartment, but it was obvious that something was off about him. He wouldn’t stop staring at my chest and it kinda creeped me out.”<br><br>“Didn’t you report this already? Why are you telling us again?” Detective Lassiter asked.<br><br>Natalie was about to reply when the room filled with a familiar scent. The smell of coffee and bacon, her favorite combination for breakfast.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood walked in and set a plate of food down on the table in front of her.<br><br>“For the love of God, Trevor Lockwood! What do you want from me?”<br><br>Trevor moved closer to her and whispered in her ear. <br><br>“I want you, Natalie Harper.”<br><br>Natalie stood up and pushed him away. The detectives looked over at the two of them before they were startled by a loud banging on the door. They all turned around to see who was there, only to find Trevor standing outside with a knife in his hand.<br><br>“I have your money now, Natalie Harper, and I’m not afraid to use it.”<br><br>Detective Johnson took out his gun and pointed it at Trevor Lockwood. He shook his head in disbelief as he continued to point the gun at him.<br><br>“You can’t come in here with that knife, you crazy son of a bitch! Get out of here or I’ll shoot!”<br><br>Detective Lassiter moved between the two of them and tried to calm them down.<br><br>“Put the gun down, Detective Johnson! We don’t want to escalate this situation any further than it already is! If we take this any further, we could all be in danger. We need to figure out how to diffuse it first. Do you have a warrant?”<br><br>Detective Johnson shook his head.<br><br>“I don’t have a warrant but I do have probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. I’m here to arrest an individual for attempted murder.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter took them into the main police station. They sat down at a long table and Detective Johnson ordered everyone, including the secretaries and other detectives, to leave the room.<br><br>“Now, Detective Johnson, tell me what happened? Who did you come here to arrest? Did this person do something wrong?”<br><br>Detective Lassiter looked at the two policemen in front of him, waiting for one of them to speak up. One of them spoke first.<br><br>“Yes, we have a warrant out for a man named Trevor Lockwood. We think he may be responsible for the disappearance of five young women.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter did a quick internet search on his phone and then sat back in his chair.<br><br>“Wait, this is the same man that you came here to arrest? The one that just arrived here as well? The one who came here to… what exactly did you  say he was here to do? Did he come here to talk with you about something?”<br><br>Detective Johnson opened the folder with documentation for Trevor Lockwood. He handed it across the table to Detective Lassiter.<br><br>“His records indicate that he came here to speak with our witness, so we could arrest him.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter flipped through a few pages and then looked up at the two policemen.<br><br>“Wait, this says here that he is a serial killer?”<br><br>Detective Johnson nodded.<br><br>“That is correct. He has lured five young women to their deaths in the past three years. We believe he tried to lure our witness here today, but that she refused to go with him and instead came here to the police station where we were able to apprehend him.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter continued flipping through pages of paperwork before standing up.<br><br>“Where is this man now? We need to move fast to make an arrest.”<br><br>The two detectives explained that he was in a holding cell in the courthouse. Detective Lassiter left to make arrangements.<br><br>Detective Johnson looked down at the file on his lap and then back up at me.<br><br>“Are you ready to move forward with your statement?”<br><br>I nodded. “Yes, of course! I just need a few minutes though, if that’s okay with you.”<br><br>The two detectives agreed. I exited the room and moved to the side staircase and began climbing. When I reached the fourth floor, I entered an empty courtroom and sat down in front of the large window that overlooked Main Street. It was quiet and peaceful here, but it wouldn’t be for long. I moved to the front of the room and took a seat at the witness stand.<br><br>The courtroom door opened and Detective Johnson walked in. He closed the door behind him and turned to face me as he walked toward the witness stand.<br><br>“No problem, I understand that you just  went through something very traumatic. Take all the time you need to compose yourself. We can keep this quick and easy if you like, or we can take our time…whatever works for you.”<br><br>“It would be good to get this over with so I can begin putting my life back together.”<br><br>Detective Johnson nodded and then walked over to a wooden chair sitting directly in front of the witness stand. He sat down and then paused for a moment before speaking.<br><br>“I have a few questions I need to ask you that will help us move forward, but first I need you to meet someone.”<br><br>“Okay, who is it?”<br><br>Detective Johnson reached into his pocket and removed a piece of paper from inside his wallet. After unfolding the paper he handed it to me, and then moved closer to me.<br><br>“This is a picture of Trevor Lockwood,” he said as he pointed at the photograph. “This man is wanted by the police for multiple counts of kidnapping and murder. According to your statement, you are the latest in a long list of women who went missing under similar circumstances.”<br><br>He moved back to the wooden chair and placed his hands behind his head.<br><br>“The details of the crimes vary in each case, but they all follow the same pattern: The women agreed to meet a handsome man on a certain date after speaking with him online, but when they arrive at the location given by the man they were never heard from again. We have five instances where this exact scenario took place, and in all cases the women went to that location, but never came back.”<br><br>The detective moved closer to me, then continued talking.<br><br>“Lockwood would go to the location where the transactions were supposed to take place, but when a woman arrived there he would either move the location or have one of his accomplices do it. In all cases, no trace of any of these women was ever found again. We have gone to the locations Lockwood has been listed at, but all traces of him were long gone.”<br><br>He moved back to the chair and straightened his tie.<br><br>“The reason why we moved so quickly in this instance is that one of our informers said that Lockwood had been planning to lure yet another woman to her death, and that he had been bragging about it online. We were able to track him down and arrest him before he could carry out his plan.”<br><br>The detective paused for a moment, then looked at me.<br><br>“So, you see, Miss Harper, you are very lucky to be alive.”<br><br>I nodded in understanding, then asked the question that had been on my mind since I had first heard about this case.<br><br>“Detective, why do you think Trevor Lockwood did this?”<br><br>The detective leaned back in his chair and sighed.<br><br>“That, Miss Harper, is something that we may never know for sure. But I have my theories.”",1

And I searched the room before we left, and he wasn’t anywhere in it.”<br><br>	“Well, where could he have gone?” Brian asked me, looking at the house. “There’s only one way out of this place, and he couldn’t have gotten out on his own.”<br><br>	I looked towards the house, wondering how he could have gotten out, but was stopped from saying anything else when I heard the door from the garage being opened.<br><br>	The door from the garage was opened all the way, and I could see out into the open garage, but we weren’t sure if there was anyone in it or not because we couldn’t see anyone in it.<br><br>	I walked to the door, and opened it a few inches to look out into the garage, but I still couldn’t see anyone in it.<br><br>	“There’s nobody in here…” I said, turning around to look at Brian. “I think he’s gone.”<br><br>	I closed the door, and turned around, walking back towards Brian when I heard something behind me.<br><br>	Something was walking out of the garage, and it was coming towards me. I turned around just in time to see it, and I screamed.<br><br>	It was a man! He was coming towards me! And he wasn’t wearing any clothes!<br><br>	I screamed again, and ran to the garage door, trying to close it. But the man was in front of it, and he moved out of the way just as I was about to close it.<br><br>	“Hello!” he said, smiling at me. “How are you?”<br><br>	“What the hell are you doing in here?!” I asked him, backing away from him. “Get out of here!”<br><br>	“Well…” he said, turning around for a second, looking at the garage door. “I was just going to look for that new guy. We haven’t seen him for a few hours now…”<br><br>	“Well, we’ve been out here for a few minutes already, and he was here when we got back…” I said, looking at him. “You know how dangerous it is for you to be in here with us. You could get sick.”<br><br>	“Oh no! I don’t think so!” he replied, turning around to look at me. “I hope I don’t get sick! Because I really don’t want that to happen to me.”<br><br>	“I don’t understand!” I said, shouting. “Why are you in here? Where is the new guy? Are you still looking for him?!”<br><br>	“Yes! Yes, I am! But why are you so concerned about where he is?” he asked me. “Have you seen him?”<br><br>	I turned away from the man, and started to walk towards where Brian was standing, but the man grabbed my arm.<br><br>	“Yes!” he replied, looking at me. “I have seen him!”<br><br>	Brian and I walked back towards the garage door, and Brian opened it back up so he could look out into the garage again. He scanned for a few seconds, but there was still nobody in it.<br><br>	“Where did he go?” Brian asked, looking at me as he closed the door again. “He was right here a second ago…”<br><br>	“I don’t know, Brian!” I replied. “But as soon as he saw that man, he ran away from us, and we haven’t seen him since.”<br><br>	“You know what?” Brian said, turning around to look at me. “He probably just went off to do his own thing. I mean, he’s a grown man. He can do whatever he wants. We can’t tell him what to do, you know?”<br><br>	“I know that!” I replied, turning around to look at him. “But I just think it’s weird that he ran away from us like that. Especially because we just met him today!”<br><br>	“He’s probably just upset because we won’t let him do what he wants to do,” Brian replied, smiling at me. “He’ll be back. Maybe he went for a walk or something.”<br><br>	I nodded at him, and we walked into the kitchen. We were both hungry, and we needed to get something to eat as soon as possible. We were worried about Adam",0
The world ends in a cataclysmic event.,"The world ended. The sky turned red and the ground shook. There was a great flash of white light and everything went dark.

 One after another the houses of the village started burning. A few moments later, one of the houses exploded with a sound like an earthquake. The windows shattered and a fiery column of smoke rose in the air like a pyre. The explosion hurled splinters of broken glass far and wide, and the villagers began running for cover.

 As they fled, many of them stopped to watch as they could see nothing but red in the sky above them. Then in the distance came a loud rumbling as if a gigantic beast was stampeding over the landscape. It was not long before everyone saw that it was not one beast but many, and they were not stampeding but running at incredible speed.

 The beasts were huge creatures with huge heads whose skin was a fiery red color and their eyes were blazing white. The creatures ran  at enormous speed, their sharp claws dug deep into the earth as they tore through the fields and forests.

One of the monsters turned in their direction and roared, sending shivers down their spines. Despite his great fear, the king shouted orders to his men to stand firm and fight for their lives. He had hoped that the beasts would pass by them, but he knew that would be wishful thinking.

 There was a loud roar and a red fireball flew toward them. The fireball fell near the royal tent, casting a bright light against the canvas. Everyone could see what happened next clearly because flames shot out from the fireball and hit the royal tent, burning it to ashes in an instant.

The king turned pale as he realized what would happen if they were caught outside. He quickly ordered his soldiers to run for cover and then did the same himself.

 A moment later there was another loud roar, this time much louder and nearer. It was as if all of the beasts had turned on their direction. Instantly, everyone scattered in different directions to look for shelter.

 The beast roared again and leaped into the air in a single bound.

The beast landed right in front of them, sending a shockwave through the ground that knocked them all to the ground. It was at least twenty feet tall and its body seemed to be made entirely of spikes, except its head.

Its face was hideous beyond belief. There were two huge horns on its head and two more on top of its shoulders while countless razor-sharp teeth lined both jaws. It had large red wings that looked like bat wings, but it was too big to be a bat. Its entire body was covered with thick fur, except for the spikes on its back and tail.

The beast raised its arms in the air and let out a deafening roar right into their faces. They all jumped up in alarm and ran off to different directions as fast as they could. A moment later, they heard the beast’s tail smash through several buildings and the screams of the people inside.

At that moment, a powerful gust of wind blew, knocking everyone over to the ground once again. The beast landed on top of them and killed anyone it found alive by tearing off their heads with its sharp teeth.

After the monster finished destroying several buildings, people in the crowd finally realized that whatever was going on was much, much worse than they had imagined. In fact, it was as if some sort of demonic beast  was hunting them down in order to kill them. The crowd ran at full speed away from the monster for their lives, but it was no use.

The beast chased after them and managed to catch up with most of them before they could get too far away. This time, it threw down shockwaves that knocked the people over, and then crushed them under its heavy body when they tried to get up.

It was only in those moments when the monster wasn’t busy chasing them that people felt safe enough to take a breath of relief. However, their momentary relief was soon shattered by the sound of crumbling buildings and screams coming from all around them.

The creature had gone out of control and began smashing everything in its path. It seemed as if the monster’s eyes glowed red as everything it saw turned into dust and ruins. The townspeople started panicking even more than they had been before, fearing that the beast would find them wherever they went. Their fears were justified when the lights on their cell phones died, leaving them in complete darkness.

Maria Martinez surveyed the dark street as she ran, unable to see where her feet were stepping on the ground. She felt herself stumble over something, but didn’t fall because of her quick reflexes.

Just then, a gigantic shadow fell over her, and she felt something heavy land on her back. She tried not to panic, yet couldn’t help but feel a sense of dread about what was happening. 

“Hey! What are you doing?” she cried out, trying to shake off the creature on her back. “Get off me!”

A flash of bright light caused her to close her eyes, and when she opened them again she saw that she was still standing in the middle of the street.

“Thank god for that,” she said to herself with a sigh of relief, not realizing that this was just the beginning of her escape from a much bigger danger than any normal human being could have ever imagined.

The sound of crashing sounds accompanied by piercing screams echoed in the distance. The ground started to crumble and buildings collapsed all around her.

The lights on her cell phone had suddenly flickered back on, but instead of the usual bright white light which illuminated the street, they were now casting an eerie orange glow around everything.

She looked up above to the sky, and this time she couldn’t see a single star. The red tint which had been there before had now disappeared from the clouds and her vision was clear, yet she found it strange that there was absolutely no trace of any sunlight at all. 

“This is so crazy!” she muttered to herself, trying to calm down. “I wonder if this is just a power outage or if there really is some kind of apocalypse going on here.”

Suddenly, a loud rumbling sound began to shake the ground beneath her feet.

“What the hell is going on?” she thought to herself. “It must be an earthquake or something, but it doesn’t feel like any earthquake I’ve ever experienced before! This is worse!” 

Before she could finish her thought, a terrible sound suddenly sounded behind her. It was the sound of breaking glass and metal being crushed under immense pressure.

Immediately, fear came over her as she turned around to face the source of that hideous noise, which was now so loud that it seemed to be all around her.

However, when she looked up through the window of the building she was in, all she could see were black clouds and an eerie red glow coming from them.

Maria grabbed the door handle and pulled it, turning to run away from that terrible sound, but she barely made it halfway across the room before the entire foundation of the building broke apart beneath her feet, causing her to fall through the rubble.

She hit her head hard as she fell to the ground and felt her body go numb from pain. She cried out, not knowing what was happening, as she tried to get up off of her hands and knees to look for the cause of that terrible noise.

The creature was on the ground under her, and it reared back its head in front of her. It seemed to be smiling maliciously at her through its razor sharp teeth.

Before she could find out what had happened to it, the creature brought its arm down through the rubble, grabbing onto her and pulling her underneath it.

She heard her daughter screaming above as the building collapsed on top of her and then everything went black.

Maria woke up with a start, taking a deep breath of air and looking around at the room that she had been in.

She was on her bed, resting with her back against the headboard of her bed. The window was open, allowing the warm sunlight to pour into the room from outside.

The strange dream she had just experienced was still fresh in her mind, and she was almost certain that her daughter, Sarah, had been in it.

Suddenly, Maria heard a soft knock at the door before it opened slightly, and Sarah stuck her head in. She smiled at her mother for a moment before walking over to the bed to give her a hug. Maria returned the hug with one of her own.

“Good afternoon, Mom,” said Sarah. “How are you feeling?”

Her mother took a deep breath, bracing herself as she got ready to tell her daughter about what had happened the previous night. She then told her daughter everything that had happened, going over every  detail.

Sarah stared up at her mother with wide eyes as she listened to everything she had to say.

“Yes, I know,” said Maria, shaking her head. “But I think it was just a weird dream or something. I hope so anyway!”

She then got up from the bed and went over to the window that faced out onto the street. She looked down below and saw that many of the houses in her neighborhood were missing their roofs. She could also see a few cars piled on top of each other; their owners forced to abandon them in their haste to flee the danger.

“I thought that this was just going to be a bit of an Earthquake,” said Maria. “But it looks like much more than that!”

She looked back at her daughter. Sarah looked back at her mother as well. Neither of them said anything for a few minutes, both of them just standing there silent.

“Is there anything we can do?” asked Maria, breaking the silence.

Sarah shook her head silently, trying to process everything her mother had just told her. Her face showed signs of worry and concern, which made Maria smile.

“I don’t know where we’re going to go now, though…” said Sarah, looking worriedly out the window again.

She heard a loud crash from outside again and looked back out onto the street. Several more houses that were across the street from her own had fallen down, burying some other houses that were behind them.

“I think we should leave,” said Maria. “That was too strong of an Earthquake to stay here any longer. Let’s get you dressed and pack up a few things. I’ll grab some food and water so we can bring it with us.”

Sarah nodded, relieved to hear that her mother knew what she was doing. She glanced over at the pile of rubble that had fallen from the house across the street, some parts of which were still moving slightly. She shuddered, looking back outside to make sure nothing else would fall.

“Is that all?” asked Sarah.

Maria thought for a moment, then picked up a few bottles from the floor and handed them to Sarah, who took them and looked at them curiously.",1
Brad realizes the error of his ways and comes to appreciate Shannon for the wonderful woman she was.,"”

Brad pulled Shannon close, wrapping his arms tightly around her. He buried his face in the top of her head and kissed her repeatedly on the top of the head. She could feel him breathing heavily as he held her close, and she gently stroked his back with one hand as they stood there together.

“Shannon, I can’t stand the thought of you being gone. You’re such a huge part of my life, and you make it so much better every single day. I can’t imagine a world without you in it. So please promise me that no matter what, you’ll never leave me like this again. You don’t know how horrible it is to think that I almost lost you. We have so much to live for.”

Shannon leaned back and stared up into Brad’s face, “I promise I won’t do this ever again.”

She wrapped her arms around him and they embraced each other tightly, holding each other against the pain they were feeling at this moment. Brad took a small step to the side so he could look down into her eyes. He gently stroked her cheek with his thumb as he said, “I don’t know what I’d do without you. You make my life so wonderful. Every morning when I wake up, it’s because of you that I have the strength to get out of bed and face another day. You’re everything to me, Shannon. I love you so much. You’re the best thing in my life. And if you ever try to leave me again, I won’t let you go. I can’t live without you. I love you so much, Shannon.”

Brad brought his lips up to hers for a gentle kiss, and then he took her by the hand and placed it into his. She looked up into his face once more and they gazed at each other lovingly. Brad reached down with the other hand to gently take her by the chin and turn her head so he could kiss her again. Their tongues twisted around and danced around in their mouths while Brad continued to stroke Shannon’s cheek with his thumb. She opened her mouth a little wider to take him inside, and then she brought her hands up to wrap them around his neck as their tongues moved together.  Brad slowly brought his mouth down to hers, and then he pressed his lips firmly against hers, still keeping her face turned toward him so that she could continue kissing him just as passionately. Finally Brad broke the kiss and looked into Shannon’s eyes.

“Hmmm,” he moaned. “You taste so good, baby. I know you’re stressed out right now, but I think we need to have sex right now. Why don’t you go lock the door while I get a condom?”

Shannon smiled at Brad and nodded her head before quickly getting up and walking toward the door. She turned around and leaned her head against the door frame before reaching down to pat Brad on his ass as she passed by and whispered, “Thanks for understanding, honey. I’m glad we can still be together after all this.”
Brad smiled at Shannon’s words, and he stood up to go get the condom from his night stand drawer. As he walked into the bathroom, he couldn’t help but wonder whether Shannon ever truly understood how much she meant to him or whether she was regretting her decision to commit suicide. He knew that there was a very good possibility that this would be their final time together, and he wanted to make the most of it.

“Okay, I’m ready,” Brad called out a few minutes later as he walked back into the bedroom.

Shannon came out of her bathroom and smiled at Brad before crawling onto his bed. She took a small step backward before turning around and laying down on the bed face down with her ass sticking up in the air. She motioned for Brad to come over as she asked in a sweet voice, “Are you coming up here or what?”

Brad climbed on the bed behind Shannon and felt her firm butt cheeks press up against him as he began kissing her neck and shoulders. He reached down to stroke her thighs before lifting up her blouse and sliding his hand under it to cup her bare breast. As he softly squeezed her breast, he asked in a sexy voice, “Are you sure about this?”

Shannon didn’t say anything. Instead she moaned softly as Brad continued to caress her right breast. He reached down between her legs and stroked the inside of her thigh with his  fingers before moving them inch by inch toward her vagina.

“Brad!” Shannon exclaimed after a few seconds had passed.

“What?” Brad asked as he continued to make circles around her vagina with his index finger.

“I have a favor to ask you,” Shannon said in a half whisper.

“What is it?” Brad asked as he stopped moving his finger and started massaging her clit with it instead.

Shannon looked over her shoulder at Brad and hesitated before speaking. “Please, don’t do anything to me tonight,” she whispered as she buried her face into the pillow.

“What? Why?” Brad asked as he felt Shannon’s body stiffen up.

Shannon kept her head buried in the pillow and didn’t say anything. Brad continued to rub Shannon’s clit until he felt her body tense up again. Then he removed his fingers from her vagina and stopped rubbing her clit. He got off of Shannon’s back and climbed off of the bed so that he was standing beside it.

“What? Why are you doing that?” Shannon asked as she sat up and looked at Brad.

“Would you please tell me what’s wrong?” Brad asked as he moved closer to Shannon and placed his arm around her shoulders.

Shannon hung her head down and closed her eyes before speaking. “I don’t know,” she said softly. “I just… I just can’t tonight,” she continued as she opened her eyes and looked over at Brad. “It’s too soon, I guess,” she added with a little sob.

“Oh, Shannon, no!” Brad exclaimed as he sat down on the bed next to her. “I’m so sorry! What happened? Did I do something wrong? Was it my fault?” he asked as he held Shannon tightly.

“No, Brad, you didn’t do anything wrong!” Shannon said while she hugged Brad tight. “It’s really not you, and I don’t know why! I just… I just can’t have sex with you tonight, if it ’s okay,” she added softly.

Brad gently stroked her hair as he spoke. “Um… how about if we just try snuggling?”

Shannon looked up and smiled as she nodded her head. “That sounds wonderful, Brad. I love to snuggle with you,” she said as she held Brad tight in her arms.

Brad kissed the top of Shannon’s head as he held her tightly. “I love you so much, Shannon,” he said with a sigh before closing his eyes and resting his cheek on the top of her head.

“I love you too, Brad,” Shannon whispered as she gently rocked him back and forth. “You know, we don’t have to have sex every night! We can just snuggle in bed together if you want!” she offered softly.

“I know, and I wouldn’t mind that at all. I just feel weird when we don’t,” Brad admitted as he opened his eyes to look at Shannon.

Shannon smiled and nodded her head lovingly. “I know… but that doesn’t mean you have to! I can just snuggle with you and hold you close, okay?” she offered.

Brad smiled and nodded his head. “That would be great,” he said as he placed a quick kiss on her head again.

After a few minutes of Brad kissing the top of her head, Shannon rolled over and rested against him. “See? It’s just as good! And it’s so much more loving than having sex,” she offered with a smile.

Brad smiled a bit and nodded his head. “I know… but I just want you to be happy, and I miss having sex with you,” he admitted.

Shannon sighed a bit and looked up at Brad. “Oh, Brad… you have to know how much I love you! And I want to make love with you, believe me! But it just hurts too much right now. Maybe someday we can have sex again, but for now… this will have to do, okay?” she said with a sad smile. 

Brad nodded his head, and with a sigh, he rolled over and grabbed Shannon’s hand. “Okay, if that’s what you want. I just wanted to make sure you weren’t just trying to avoid having sex with me,” he admitted sheepishly.

Shannon looked back at Brad with a smile. “I promise – I’m not avoiding it! I just don’t want to hurt you, and right now… it does hurt too much for me to consider doing that,” she said with sadness in her eyes.

Brad nodded and squeezed Shannon’s hand gently. “All right,” he said and then gave her a soft kiss on the lips. “Now let’s snuggle some more, okay?” he suggested with a smile.

Shannon chuckled and nodded her head. “Sure, I’d love to. And this… is nice, too,” she said as Brad wrapped his arms around her gently and held her tightly. And they spent the rest of the evening snuggled together on their couch, holding each other close and just enjoying each other’s company.

A few moments later, Brad pulled away and looked down at Shannon with a loving smile. “I love you so much, babe – so very much!” he said quietly.

Shannon smiled and pressed her lips to his softly. “I love you, too, Brad – so very much! I just wish we were still having sex…” she said with a wistful sigh.

Brad glanced down at Shannon and shook his head slightly. “I miss it, too, Shannon… but right now… what we have is more important.”

Shannon nodded and smiled at him. “You’re right, I know you’re right… but our sex life is something that I miss. You know that, don’t you?”

Brad nodded and smiled sadly at her. “I know… I miss it, too. But we don’t have to make love every night, you know… just once in a while would be nice – like tonight.”

Shannon frowned slightly and looked away. But she sighed  and nodded. “I know,” she said quietly.

Dan Barton suddenly walked into the room and stared in shock at his son and daughter-in-law. “What are you two doing?” he asked angrily.

Brad bit his lip nervously and glanced down at Shannon. Shannon could feel the heat rising in her cheeks as she looked up at Dan.

“No… we haven’t…” Brad started. “Shannon and I were just… we were just talking, Dad!” Brad stammered.

Dan raised an eyebrow at the couple. He then cleared his throat and looked away, trying to hide a smile. He cleared his throat again and said, “Good. Well, you two have talked enough for tonight. Now run along to bed. Brad, have you given any more thought to that job offer at the firm?”

Shannon looked at Brad with alarm. She had hoped to talk about their relationship and what was wrong with it before anything was mentioned about working in Dan’s law firm again. But as usual, when she wanted something from Brad he did the opposite of what she wanted. “Uh, yeah… I have given it some thought,” Brad said reluctantly. “I just don’t know if I want to work in a law office again, Dad. I mean… what am I going to be doing? It’s not like you need some guy taking phone calls all day or something.”

Shannon was livid. She could see Brad wanting to work in the law office again—it had been his dream when he was younger—but she also knew that Brad didn’t love working for his father like he once had. “Brad,  I don’t want you to work for your father… unless you want to, of course.” Dan looked at her with surprise; Shannon rarely talked back to her father.

The two exchanged a few words and decided to keep the issue open until Brad filled out the paperwork and started working in the office. “Karen, I’d like you to meet my oldest daughter, Shannon. She’s a bit of a fireball, isn’t she?” Dan asked his girlfriend. “Wow, yeah… that was definitely an understatement! What were you saying about working with me?”

“I haven’t said anything about working with you. I just said that I can see why your wife would want to work for you if it was fun, but is it—?”

Shannon was sick of the way Brad was acting. He hadn’t shown an ounce of concern about her since she’d left him a month ago, and now he was practically drooling over Karen. “Just because I don’t want to work here doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t. I just don’t think it’s a good idea for you to follow in your dad’s footsteps. I don’t think you have good judgment when it comes to things like this. You want the truth? Your dad is a self-centered jerk. I can see why my older sister married him, though; he’s wealthy and he can keep her in expensive clothes and jewelry. But he’ll never love her or care about her like she deserves. And I think that’s what you want, isn’t it? What you deserve—to be loved and cared about. Well, let me tell you one thing. You don’t show a girl you care about her by lying to her for four years and having an affair with her sister. No, Brad Barton. You aren’t going to find a better job or better people in this town than in your dad’s firm, and you know it.”

“Shannon, I love you. I always have and I always will. It doesn’t matter what we do for a living or where we live; all that matters is that we’re together. I want us to get pregnant again right away. I want  to start our own business. I want to make you happy, Shannon.”

Shannon sat up straighter, her eyes narrowing at him. “You are not going to turn my family against me. You can see them when and if they come to the funeral, but we are not going out anymore. After it’s over, I don’t want to see you anymore.”

Brad was staring at her now. His face was pained, almost as if he were in physical pain from the intensity of his feelings for her. “You don’t mean that, Shannon.”

Shannon stood up and turned to face him, tears streaming down her cheeks. “I do mean it. I want to be with Jeremy and my family and your daughter for the rest of my life—but I don’t want you to be a part of it! Do you understand what I’m saying?”

Brad stood up now, his face red with anger. “No, Shannon! No!” He pushed at her, his arms outstretched as if he were trying to stop her from leaving.

Shannon continued to stand her ground. She was trembling with anger and, she realized, with sadness as well. Suddenly, she felt overwhelmed by grief and collapsed on the floor. Brad rushed over to her, his arms reaching for her.

“Shannon! Shannon, please don’t do this. I need you, Shannon. I need you in my life. Don’t leave me alone…don’t do this to us,” he pleaded.

She pushed at him again and again and again until he finally backed away from her. “Oh, God…I’m so sorry, Brad,” she cried. “I didn’t mean to make you feel bad…you deserve better than me…Jeremy deserves better than this. I should just go away and leave you alone, but I just can’t do it. I can’t, Brad. I can’t!”

He stood there staring at her for a long moment before walking over to the couch and sitting down, his head in his hands. Shannon sat down on the floor beside him and pulled her legs up against her chest. She rested her cheek on her knees for a moment before looking over at him. His head was still in his hands, but she could see the tears running down his cheeks.

“I’m so sorry, Shannon,” he whispered.",0
"Valerie Marx wakes up in a dark basement, bound and gagged.","Valerie woke up sitting on the floor of a concrete basement, which was about ten feet deep and twenty feet across. The walls were covered with thick black plastic, which had been painted over with white lines every few inches to simulate bricks. There were two wooden doors spaced several feet apart across the back of the basement, and a single window was set high up in the far wall, about six feet off the ground. The only light came from a bare bulb hanging from a line connected to an extension cord plugged into a socket several feet away from the window. The bulb swung freely, swinging even more when Valerie shook her head violently in  an attempt to clear her groggy vision.

Valerie’s hands and feet were tied together with thick twine wrapped around her wrists and ankles several times. After shaking off the dizziness, Valerie tried to free herself but realized that it was impossible without cutting through the thick twine. Valerie got down on her knees to find a sharp object with which she could cut through the twine. Valerie looked around and noticed that her dress was torn and dirty, and she wondered how long it had been since she had last changed clothes and when the last time she had eaten was. 

Valerie found a ceramic bowl filled with water in one corner of the basement and drank some of it. She felt a little better after that but still groggy, and the water did nothing to alleviate her thirst. Valerie continued exploring the basement until she reached the two wooden doors at the back of the room. 

The rightmost door was locked, and Valerie noticed signs of forced entry nearby. The leftmost door was also locked but had no signs of forced entry.

Valerie searched the dirt-covered floor for an object that she could use to break open one of the doors. When she found nothing, Valerie decided to explore the rest of the basement before considering how to escape from there.

As Valerie traveled deeper into the basement, she noticed that it was a lot smaller than it originally seemed. The ceiling became lower and lower as Valerie moved forward, and a musty smell filled her nostrils.  Valerie suddenly realized that time had passed since she had found the ceramic bowl, and she wondered why no one had come down looking for her by then.

Valerie eventually reached a dead end at the far end of the basement, where she discovered a small window with bars on it that was positioned too high up for",0

Its face was hideous beyond belief. There were two huge horns on its head and two more on top of its shoulders while countless razor-sharp teeth lined both jaws. It had large red wings that looked like bat wings, but it was too big to be a bat. Its entire body was covered with thick fur, except for the spikes on its back and tail.

The beast raised its arms in the air and let out a deafening roar right into their faces. They all jumped up in alarm and ran off to different directions as fast as they could. A moment later, they heard the beast’s tail smash through several buildings and the screams of the people inside.

At that moment, a powerful gust of wind blew, knocking everyone over to the ground once again. The beast landed on top of them and killed anyone it found alive by tearing off their heads with its sharp teeth.

After the monster finished destroying several buildings, people in the crowd finally realized that whatever was going on was much, much worse than they had imagined. In fact, it was as if some sort of demonic beast  was hunting them down in order to kill them. The crowd ran at full speed away from the monster for their lives, but it was no use.

The beast chased after them and managed to catch up with most of them before they could get too far away. This time, it threw down shockwaves that knocked the people over, and then crushed them under its heavy body when they tried to get up.

It was only in those moments when the monster wasn’t busy chasing them that people felt safe enough to take a breath of relief. However, their momentary relief was soon shattered by the sound of crumbling buildings and screams coming from all around them.

The creature had gone out of control and began smashing everything in its path. It seemed as if the monster’s eyes glowed red as everything it saw turned into dust and ruins. The townspeople started panicking even more than they had been before, fearing that the beast would find them wherever they went. Their fears were justified when the lights on their cell phones died, leaving them in complete darkness.

Maria Martinez surveyed the dark street as she ran, unable to see where her feet were stepping on the ground. She felt herself stumble over something, but didn’t fall because of her quick reflexes.

Just then, a gigantic shadow fell over her, and she felt something heavy land on her back. She tried not to panic, yet couldn’t help but feel a sense of dread about what was happening. 

“Hey! What are you doing?” she cried out, trying to shake off the creature on her back. “Get off me!”

A flash of bright light caused her to close her eyes, and when she opened them again she saw that she was still standing in the middle of the street.

“Thank god for that,” she said to herself with a sigh of relief, not realizing that this was just the beginning of her escape from a much bigger danger than any normal human being could have ever imagined.

The sound of crashing sounds accompanied by piercing screams echoed in the distance. The ground started to crumble and buildings collapsed all around her.

The lights on her cell phone had suddenly flickered back on, but instead of the usual bright white light which illuminated the street, they were now casting an eerie orange glow around everything.

She looked up above to the sky, and this time she couldn’t see a single star. The red tint which had been there before had now disappeared from the clouds and her vision was clear, yet she found it strange that there was absolutely no trace of any sunlight at all. 

“This is so crazy!” she muttered to herself, trying to calm down. “I wonder if this is just a power outage or if there really is some kind of apocalypse going on here.”

Suddenly, a loud rumbling sound began to shake the ground beneath her feet.

“What the hell is going on?” she thought to herself. “It must be an earthquake or something, but it doesn’t feel like any earthquake I’ve ever experienced before! This is worse!” 

Before she could finish her thought, a terrible sound suddenly sounded behind her. It was the sound of breaking glass and metal being crushed under immense pressure.

Immediately, fear came over her as she turned around to face the source of that hideous noise, which was now so loud that it seemed to be all around her.

However, when she looked up through the window of the building she was in, all she could see were black clouds and an eerie red glow coming from them.

Maria grabbed the door handle and pulled it, turning to run away from that terrible sound, but she barely made it halfway across the room before the entire foundation of the building broke apart beneath her feet, causing her to fall through the rubble.

She hit her head hard as she fell to the ground and felt her body go numb from pain. She cried out, not knowing what was happening, as she tried to get up off of her hands and knees to look for the cause of that terrible noise.

The creature was on the ground under her, and it reared back its head in front of her. It seemed to be smiling maliciously at her through its razor sharp teeth.

Before she could find out what had happened to it, the creature brought its arm down through the rubble, grabbing onto her and pulling her underneath it.

She heard her daughter screaming above as the building collapsed on top of her and then everything went black.

Maria woke up with a start, taking a deep breath of air and looking around at the room that she had been in.

She was on her bed, resting with her back against the headboard of her bed. The window was open, allowing the warm sunlight to pour into the room from outside.

The strange dream she had just experienced was still fresh in her mind, and she was almost certain that her daughter, Sarah, had been in it.

Suddenly, Maria heard a soft knock at the door before it opened slightly, and Sarah stuck her head in. She smiled at her mother for a moment before walking over to the bed to give her a hug. Maria returned the hug with one of her own.

“Good afternoon, Mom,” said Sarah. “How are you feeling?”

Her mother took a deep breath, bracing herself as she got ready to tell her daughter about what had happened the previous night. She then told her daughter everything that had happened, going over every  detail.

Sarah stared up at her mother with wide eyes as she listened to everything she had to say.

“Yes, I know,” said Maria, shaking her head. “But I think it was just a weird dream or something. I hope so anyway!”

She then got up from the bed and went over to the window that faced out onto the street. She looked down below and saw that many of the houses in her neighborhood were missing their roofs. She could also see a few cars piled on top of each other; their owners forced to abandon them in their haste to flee the danger.

“I thought that this was just going to be a bit of an Earthquake,” said Maria. “But it looks like much more than that!”

She looked back at her daughter. Sarah looked back at her mother as well. Neither of them said anything for a few minutes, both of them just standing there silent.

“Is there anything we can do?” asked Maria, breaking the silence.

Sarah shook her head silently, trying to process everything her mother had just told her. Her face showed signs of worry and concern, which made Maria smile.

“I don’t know where we’re going to go now, though…” said Sarah, looking worriedly out the window again.

She heard a loud crash from outside again and looked back out onto the street. Several more houses that were across the street from her own had fallen down, burying some other houses that were behind them.

“I think we should leave,” said Maria. “That was too strong of an Earthquake to stay here any longer. Let’s get you dressed and pack up a few things. I’ll grab some food and water so we can bring it with us.”

Sarah nodded, relieved to hear that her mother knew what she was doing. She glanced over at the pile of rubble that had fallen from the house across the street, some parts of which were still moving slightly. She shuddered, looking back outside to make sure nothing else would fall.

“Is that all?” asked Sarah.

Maria thought for a moment, then picked up a few bottles from the floor and handed them to Sarah, who took them and looked at them curiously.",1
"However, when Brian Johnson's ex-girlfriend shows up and tries to win him back, Jenna Adams realizes that marriage isn't for her after all and that it's better to be alone than with someone who doesn't truly love you.","took her hand, and they stood up together. She told him that they should go tell her parents and then they could do the rest of the planning. He agreed, and together they made their way down the stairs.

Jenna Adams stopped for a moment in the living room before walking out into the hallway to go talk to her parents. She turned around and looked at Brian Johnson. “We’re going to be married,” she said with a huge smile on her face.

Brian Johnson smiled back at her and said, “I know. I feel the same way too.” Jenna Adams noticed tears in his eyes and realized that this was because of her announcement about marriage. She also felt the urge to cry herself. She stepped out into the hallway, and he followed behind her. They walked hand in hand down the stairs and stopped when they reached the bottom.

“I can’t believe it,” said Jenna Adams smiling. “We’re going to be husband and wife.” Brian Johnson nodded his head in agreement and looked at her again. “I know,” he said again. “I feel exactly the same way too.” He looked at her and smiled and was about to say something else when he suddenly realized that Teresa Campbell was standing on the landing just outside Jenna Adams’s bedroom door. Brian Johnson and Jenna Adams turned around to see what she was doing there. She wasn’t saying anything, but she was looking at Brian Johnson with a look of sadness on her face.

Brian Johnson said, “What are you doing here?”

Teresa Campbell looked up from the floor and noticed Brian Johnson standing in front of her. “I came to see you,” she said.

Brian Johnson felt a headache coming on. He felt as if his heart were about to explode. “Uh, I was just leaving,” he said slowly, trying to act cool and calm, even though his whole body was shaking inside. “Well, wait I’ll come with you,” Teresa Campbell said. She wiped her eyes and looked up at Brian Johnson again. “I want to say goodbye.”

Brian Johnson grabbed Jenna Adams by the arm and whispered, “My ex-girlfriend is here,” then he  and Jenna Adams walked out of the room so that they could join Teresa Campbell in the hallway and leave as a group. They walked down the stairs beside each other, with Teresa Campbell walking just ahead of them.

Jenna Adams asked Brian Johnson, “Why is she here? What happened?”

Brian Johnson looked up at Jenna Adams and tried to keep his voice steady. “I don’t know,” he said. “She just showed up and I guess she wants to be friends or something.”

Jenna Adams felt a wave of sadness roll over her body. She wanted to run out of the house as fast as she could and never look back. She wanted to scream in sorrow and anger and hurt, but she decided not to because then it would seem as if she blamed Brian Johnson for his past relationship with Teresa Campbell.

“I can’t believe she was here!” Jenna Adams said. “What was she doing? What did you do? What did she do? Did you talk to her? Did-”

Brian Johnson interrupted Jenna Adams and said, “I didn’t want to talk to her. I told her I had nothing to say to her!”

Jenna Adams felt as if she was about to explode with pain and anger. She needed to vent and release the despair that was filling her body.

“Brian, why did you let her in? You know how I feel about her!”

“Jenna, this is my home and she just showed up and told me that she wanted to talk to me. I didn’t want to talk, but I couldn’t just kick her out of my home. That wouldn’t have been fair!”

“I know, but…it’s not fair that she just shows up and wants to talk to you! Why do you even want to be her friend? Why did you call her a few days ago? Did-did she tell you why she was here?”

Brian Johnson paused for a moment and said, “I called her because she wanted to apologize for everything that happened between us. She told me how she was sorry and things like that.”

Jenna Adams felt an extreme amount of pain and anger in response to everything  Brian Johnson had just said. She decided to put her feelings into words and speak them aloud, saying, “Do you still love her?”

The tone of Brian Johnson’s voice changed from calm and collected to sad and depressed as he answered quietly, “I still love her. I love her more than I ever loved you. I have never stopped loving Teresa Campbell.”

At that moment, Jenna Adams realized that she was being compared to Teresa Campbell and found it insulting. She was no longer a person; she was just an obstacle in the way of Brian Johnson’s happiness. She didn’t feel like enough for him to feel any guilt about hurting her. She felt worthless.

Jenna Adams pushed Brian Johnson away from her and said, “YOU DON’T LOVE ME ANYMORE! I DON’T CARE ANYMORE! I’VE HAD ENOUGH! I’M DONE!”

Then Jenna Adams ran out of the room and ran home, not even bothering to collect her belongings from the house and leave them on Brian Johnson’s front porch. She knew that she should have done that. She also knew that she probably didn ’t want to see Brian Johnson again, but she couldn’t help but text him later that night and say that he clearly wasn’t ready for a committed relationship just yet and that he was better off leaving her alone.

Brian Johnson responded by saying that he was so sorry for hurting Jenna Adams, but he didn’t know what to do. He said that Teresa Campbell and he were still having these intense conversations, but he didn’t want to hurt Jenna Adams anymore than he already had. Brian Johnson promised that they would talk later in the week about it further because he wanted to make things  right with Jenna Adams.

Jenna Adams was furious that Brian Johnson was texting her after she dumped him and accused him of not being able to make up his mind about anything. She was feeling so hurt and angry that she texted him back and told him that they were just going to have to stay broken up.  She said that she didn’t want to try to make their relationship work when Brian Johnson wasn’t sure what he even wanted.

Jenna Adams was relieved when Brian Johnson didn’t try to fight her on it and didn’t try to get her back. She was actually glad  that Brian Johnson was dealing with the heartbreak instead of trying to take it out on her. That meant that she didn’t have to deal with any emotional battles and that she could really start healing. Jenna Adams had spent weeks trying to get Brian Johnson in a healthy state of mind, and his decision to leave her just made things a lot easier on her.

Jenna Adams decided that she was glad that she had broken up with Brian Johnson and even though being alone was scary, at least she knew that he wasn’t going to hurt her anymore. She realized how much of an emotional burden Brian Johnson had been and wondered if she would have ever been able to fully trust him. Jenna Adams was glad that they were finally broken up, but even though they could no longer be together, she knew that his memory would always be with her. She liked thinking about the future and wondered if she would ever fall in love again and get married.

Jenna Adams was scared about being alone, but she didn’t want to be with someone who didn’t truly love her. She thought that she might never find someone who understood her and knew how to make her happy, but she knew that when the right time came, she would know. For now, she was just enjoying being single, although it had taken a while for her to get used to sleeping in her own bed again.

Jenna Adams decided that after one week of being single, she was actually doing pretty well. Jenna Adams had been making her own decisions for a while now and she knew that she could live on her own and not have to rely on anyone else in order to be happy. She had always been a pretty independent person and, although she knew that she wouldn’t be single forever, she was enjoying this new sense of freedom that she had. Jenna Adams liked being able  to do whatever she wanted without having to worry about hurting the person that she was with.

Jenna Adams had thrown away her engagement ring after she broke things off with Brian Johnson. She hadn’t wanted to keep it and it seemed wrong for her to hold on to something that meant so much to Brian Johnson when all he seemed to want was something else. Jenna Adams had thrown the ring in a drawer and made sure that she only opened it once a day because the sight of it saddened her. She thought that if she closed her eyes, it would be easier for her to forget about what happened between them and move on with her life. Now, she was feeling better and had started dating again. She knew that she would find someone else; she just wasn’t in any rush to do so right now.

“No, you don’t, Mom. I’m fine, really! I appreciate your concern and I know that you care about me, but I’m not sad at all. I promise.”

Jenna Adams had known that her mother wouldn’t listen to what she said because Mary Smith was the kind of person who always thought that she knew best. Jenna Adams knew that her mother would be concerned, but it didn’t mean that she had to agree with her.

“I just think that you might be lonely and it would be nice to have a companion. You should give Brian Johnson another chance. I think that he’s a really good guy and I can tell that he really loves you, so why don’t you give it another shot?”

Jenna Adams didn’t want to repeat herself so she decided to make her point clearly.

“No! Mom, no! He cheated on me and told me that he was only marrying me because he couldn’t have you! He was in love with you and wanted to be with you. As far as I’m concerned, that makes him an asshole.”

Mary Smith got a little upset at the suggestion that her daughter had just said about her son-in-law.

“Oh, Jenna Adams! You don’t know what you’re talking about. He was just telling you that to make you feel better and to get back together. Look, I promise that I won’t talk to him. Just give him another chance and  I think that you will be very sorry if you don’t.”

Mary Smith had been trying to convince Jenna Adams for a long time that she should get back together with Brian Johnson so she could have grandchildren and wouldn’t be so lonely. Jenna Adams had made it clear over and over that she wasn’t interested in having children anytime soon, but Mary Smith didn’t seem to understand.

“Now, it’s a little late to tell me this, don’t you think? He ruined my life and I don’t want to ever see him again.”

Mary Smith wasn’t able to say anything for a few minutes, she just stared at Jenna Adams with her mouth open. Jenna Adams knew that this was the end of the conversation because Mary Smith had nothing left to say.

“I can’t believe that you would say such a thing! He is your father and he loves you very much.”

“No, he doesn’t. He only wants me because he can’t have you. You are the one that he really loves, not me. I am just a replacement for you.”

With that, Jenna Adams turned and walked away, leaving her mother standing there in shock. She knew that she had said too much, but she couldn’t help it. She was tired of being the one that everyone felt sorry for. She was tired of being the one that everyone tried to fix. She was tired of being the one that everyone thought they could change.

Jenna Adams had had enough and she was done.",0
Gabriel moves out of his parents' house and into his own apartment.,"Gabriel’s parents helped him pack his bags. He was excited to leave his parent’s house, but he would miss his family. It all seemed like just yesterday that he had moved out of his old apartment, and now he was moving out again. He looked forward to living on his own, with no one looking over his shoulder telling him what to do. His parents were being helpful in the process, as they helped him pack up all of his things. It was a nice day for September, with a light breeze blowing through the open window in his bedroom. He still had some more stuff to pack in the basement, but he figured he would start by getting everything out of his room.

He opened the door to his room and immediately noticed that there were boxes scattered all over the carpet. He would have to get started right away, since he had a lot of packing ahead of him. His parents sat  on the couch and watched him as he went through each box, emptying it of various items. There were a lot of books, which he had no use for, so he proceeded to take them and put them in a box. He would think about donating them later on when he was done moving. Then he saw the boxes of school supplies that he had been carting around college for four years. They were dusty, but still usable, so he decided to keep them.

While Gabriel sorted through his belongings, his parents exchanged small talk with each other about how sad they were that their baby boy was moving out. They wondered  aloud why he felt the need to move into his own apartment, instead of living at home for a while longer. Gabriel simply explained that he didn’t want to be a burden to them anymore, and that it was time for him to grow up. His father replied that they would never consider him a burden.  To prove this point, his mother opened the refrigerator door and took out a box of cold cuts. She said that she could have made him a sandwich for lunch if he had wanted one, which made Gabriel laugh.

His parents went on to ask him how much they could help him with rent. He told them that he had already found a good deal on an apartment, and if they wanted to help out, they could buy some necessities for his house like a couch or a bed. They thanked him for letting them know about their financial options. Gabriel’s dad joked that if he kept his grades up, they might even allow him to buy a television, but Gabriel replied that it wouldn’t be necessary. He felt better knowing that they were so supportive of his decision to move out.

Once he had settled on where all the boxes would go, Gabriel began to get into the actual process of packing up his room. His",0
"Kyle Johnson, a man Aimee met at work, comes over to visit and the two quickly become friends.","knock on the door. Aimee didn’t realize she had been daydreaming until her
   friend asked her that question. “Yeah, I was just thinking about the first
   night I spent in this apartment,” she answered. The woman walked into her
   living room and noticed how the furniture had changed. “Who is all this stuff
   for?”
   “For you, Liz! I want you to come stay with me next summer, so I’m going to
   start getting things ready. I got a new bed and a new couch, since the old
   ones were pretty beat up. They had been here for years.” She looked at her
   friend in earnest. “You can sleep on the couch, and I’ll have the bed to
   myself.”
   “But what about Kyle?” Elizabeth asked, an eyebrow raised. It was obvious
   to Aimee that she wanted to try her luck with the guy.
   “Kyle’s out of my life, remember?” Aimee said defensively. “How does this
   furniture look? I think I might get some art for the walls today, since the
   frames are all black. Do you like it so far?” She looked at her friend, who
   was still looking at the couch. “C’mon Liz, your turn.” The woman waited for
   her to play, but she just sat on the couch and stared at Aimee expectantly.
   “Oh!” She suddenly said with a grin. “I see what you’re doing! You need to
   get an art print up on the wall here, and then when Kyle comes over for
   dinner, he’ll say in a casual way, ‘Hey, nice artwork’ and then you can say
   something back to him like, ‘Thanks, that’s from my favorite artist; I was
   lucky to be able to see an original print.’ Get it?” She was beaming with
   excitement. Aimee felt a little uncomfortable with the direction  their
   discussion was going. “I might not see Kyle again,” she said more forcefully.
   “He hasn’t called me back since that night at the party, so I doubt he wants
   to go out with me again. I don’t really care; I just want him to leave me
   alone.” The woman looked genuinely disappointed and sat down next to Aimee,
   leaning her own head back as she did so. She put her hands in her lap and
   didn’t say anything for a moment. “You’re wrong,” she said at last. “Kyle
   Johnson doesn’t want to leave you alone; he wants to get back together with
   you. He just doesn’t know how to go about it. If you want him out of your
   life, then you should take steps to make that happen—like not answering the
   door when he knocks.” “I want to be nice, but I don’t want to be a doormat!”
   Aimee said hotly. “I don’t know what to do.” “If you were just friends before
   tonight, then act like a friend. Let him in and talk to him. And let me talk
   to him too.” Aimee just looked at the other woman, then sighed. “Why did I
   tell you all this? You don’t even know Kyle!” “Lizzy, please, call me Liz. 
   And I may not know him, but I do know you. And I’ll tell you that something
   about Kyle really appeals to you. You still have feelings for him.” Aimee
   thought about this for a moment, then sighed. “You’re right, I do feel something
   for him, but he doesn’t. Do you think he just feels awkward about the kiss?
   I mean, he called me beautiful and all that—I just don’t understand what
   he’s going through.” “Well, come on in and ask him! Let me talk to him too.
   Maybe if we both do, we can figure it out. I bet he had a good time with us
   the other night, and he wants to explore it some more.” Aimee’s eyes lit up at
   this thought, and she picked up the phone to call Kyle. Before she could
   dial however, her cell buzzed with a text message from Kyle.  Aimee looked
   at the screen and groaned. It was a photo of the two of them making out in
   front of Liz’s building the night before. She looked at it with anger, then
   put down the phone and sighed. As she started to get up, she noticed that it
   was getting dark outside. “Shit,” she muttered. “I need to get ready for
   work—I’m late! Thanks for the advice, though. You were right—I need to talk
   to him.” Kyle gave her a smile and walked down the hall towards the stairs.
   Aimee stayed at her seat, trying to call him back but his number went straight
   to voicemail. She pulled up a chair and sat back down at her desk. She",0
Daisy Mayberry receives a diagnosis of cancer and her family and friends come together to support her.,"One day, Daisy Mayberry went for an extra ride on her horse, Lady Bug. The next afternoon, she went to the doctor and was diagnosed with cancer.

The doctor explained, “I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but your MRI shows a malignant tumor on your brain. I would recommend that you see an oncologist immediately for further treatment options. Your prognosis is not good, but I am certain your family would like to be with you during this trying time.”

Daisy Mayberry’s breath caught when she heard the terrifying diagnosis. She immediately thought of her beautiful daughter Elizabeth, who was currently in graduate school. Daisy’s thoughts also went to her wonderful son, Bill, who was a Marine Corp officer stationed at Camp Pendleton in California with his wife and kids. But Daisy knew that her two children would stay by her side no matter what. 

After the doctor left the room, Daisy turned to her husband Bill Simpson as if she were a child saying goodbye to Santa Claus at the mall. Bill Simpson was by Daisy’s bedside this afternoon, and he squeezed her thin hand gently.

“Daisy, I don’t know what to say. I can’t believe this is happening,” Bill said softly as he stared into his wife’s eyes.

Elizabeth Simpson immediately flew from Denver, Colorado to be at her mother and father’s side. She could not imagine having her own mother taken away from her at such a young age. When Elizabeth arrived, she immediately hugged her parents tightly and began crying on their shoulders.

Daisy and Bill both knew that the end was near, but they did not want to show their tearful daughter how afraid they were. Instead, Bill offered Elizabeth the guest bedroom upstairs while he took Daisy to their bed.

“Mama, I know it’s hard for you to say this right now, so you don’t have to if you don’t want to,” Elizabeth said softly as she held Daisy’s hand. “But I really need to know. How much time do I have left with you? Is there any possibility that you will recover?”

Daisy felt a tear roll down her cheek as she looked into her daughter’s eyes. She knew this was the hardest question she would have to answer, but she also knew this was what Elizabeth needed to hear in order to be able to cope with their situation.

“I am so sorry to have to tell you this,” Daisy said as she sobbed on her daughter’s shoulder. “But I know what is coming and I don’t want to be the reason that you are not prepared when the time comes. Can you promise me that you will do exactly what I ask?”

Elizabeth nodded as she wiped away her mother’s tears. “I promise, Mama. Do what you need to do and I will go along with it.”

With a trembling voice, Daisy said, “I am so sorry to say this but there is no possibility that I will recover. This disease has progressed too far for me to beat it now.”

Elizabeth grabbed her mother’s other hand and said,  “Then let’s face it together. You have done a great job of raising me and I am strong enough to get through this. I love you so much, Mother — please don’t leave me alone.”

Daisy hugged Elizabeth tightly while she sobbed harder than she had ever done in her entire life. She was sure that she would not survive this ordeal. Instead, Daisy decided to concentrate on being with her family during what remained of their time together.

That evening, Bill took over the operation of the hardware store while Elizabeth and her father went to stay with Daisy at the hospital. The support of her family gave Daisy strength in fighting the disease, but there was only a small chance of her recovery.

The following morning, Elizabeth called Alice Chambers to tell her about the situation. Alice and Wayne had two children of their own and they were devastated at hearing about Daisy’s illness. Alice said that she would get in touch with all of Daisy’s friends to let them know what had happened. The townspeople needed to know so that they could pray for her recovery.

In the days that followed, all of the townspeople in Maple Valley came to visit Daisy at the hospital. Bill would drive over to the hospital as many times as possible to help fill Daisy’s room with well-wishers. The visitors and prayers from her family and community helped provide Daisy with the strength she needed to continue fighting.

One evening, Bill came home from the hospital and asked Elizabeth if she would be willing to drive down to Seattle to visit one of Daisy’s oldest friends, Tanya Swanson.

Tanya was the librarian at the Maple Valley Community Library. She had been a friend of Daisy’s since they were children. It was Tanya who had suggested that Daisy should be nominated for the position as President of the Library Board of Trustees. In fact, this was how Daisy had met Bill. Although Bill and Tanya had not seen each other in a while, it was obvious that they still loved each other deeply.

Elizabeth drove to Seattle and went directly to the hospital where Tanya Swanson was being treated for leukemia. Daisy had told Elizabeth that she wanted her to explain what was happening with her to Tanya so that Tanya could pray for her. Tanya was in bad shape, but made it clear that she needed to talk with Elizabeth. 

Elizabeth explained to Tanya that Daisy was battling cancer and that she only had a few weeks left to live. She asked if Tanya would pray for her. Daisy had specifically asked Tanya to tell Elizabeth certain things that Daisy felt were important so that Elizabeth could tell Bill what was going on.

Tanya was emotional after Elizabeth told her the news about Daisy. She went into a room where she could be alone and, from there, she called Bill Simpson. They talked about the situation with Daisy for a while and then, together, they prayed for Daisy’s soul.

The following day, Bill went to visit his wife at the hospital. Elizabeth had gone back to her house and Bill was alone with Daisy. She told him the things that she wanted him to know.

That afternoon, Bill took over the operation of Daisy’s hardware store. His daughter, Lisa, stayed at the hospital to be with Daisy. The two women were all alone in the small room that Daisy was staying in.

Daisy was hooked up to a breathing apparatus and she was connected to her IVs. Lisa brought Daisy some clothes and then she prepared her for bed time. She changed the sheets on the bed and then she helped Daisy remove her clothing.

She held Daisy’s hand as they both cried. Lisa had never seen her mother cry like this before. Daisy told Lisa that she was very scared to die alone, and that she worried about Bill and Lisa being sad. She said that it was so unfair that she had to leave them.

Lisa’s heart hurt for her mother. Her mom looked so scared and frail lying in the bed. She stroked her mom’s hair and spoke softly to her. Daisy felt so safe when Lisa was holding her hand. It was as if she was being held by a child, the way she needed to be held at this time.

She closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep in Lisa’s arms. She had a dreamless sleep that night and did not awaken until the morning. As soon as Daisy woke up, she wanted to get out of bed and take a shower. She had a feeling that she wasn’t going to feel pretty for much longer and she wanted to feel as attractive as possible while she still could.

Shannon's paintings help her to deal with her grief and to find a new sense of purpose.,"She was only doing it just to express her feelings, not to make any money. But if she could sell her paintings and make some money, then maybe she could get a studio where she could paint all the time.

“I do think you can sell your paintings if you enter this show,” Katie said. “You have real talent, but you just have to figure out how to get it out there.”

Shannon had never considered that her paintings could be worth any money. She had never thought about selling her paintings. All she wanted to do was paint them for herself and to help her get through her own feelings of loss.

She walked over to the easel and looked at her painting. It was one of the first paintings she had done since her mother had passed away, and it was one of her favorites. It was a portrait of a woman with long black hair, standing with her hands on her hips looking out to sea. It was titled the Sea Witch.

“I like this one too,” Katie said as she walked over to Shannon and looked at the painting. “It reminds me of Rapunzel from that fairy tale we read together when we were younger. Remember how she let down her hair to the prince and he climbed up and rescued her from the tower? That’s what I think this woman is doing—letting down her hair to someone who can rescue her.”

Shannon nodded in agreement. “I think you’re right,” she said as she gazed at the painting. “She’s letting go of her worries and her past and looking towards something better in the future. She has this look on her face as if she is saying: I hope someone can save me from my troubles.”

Katie looked back at Shannon. “Maybe that’s why you draw and paint so much—to try to save yourself from your own troubles.”

Shannon smiled and nodded again. “Maybe,” she said with a sigh. “But I don’t feel like it’s working. She wasn’t the only one to drown in those waters, you know.”

Katie looked at the painting again and then back at Shannon. “I know. Now come on, Shannon—what are you going to do? The  painting isn’t the only thing you need to save yourself from. You need to do it for your dad and your uncle too. You can’t keep drowning.”

Shannon kept quiet for a few moments before answering. “I will try,” she finally said as she looked once more at the painting in her hands.

Katie nodded at her cousin and reached over to turn off the light, leaving Shannon in darkness once more. She turned toward the door and slipped out into the night, the door creaking quietly behind her as she left Shannon alone in her despair.

Katie walked slowly through the familiar streets, her heart heavy with what she had seen in Shannon’s paintings. What would it take to save Shannon from herself? She thought to herself as she continued walking toward home. What could be worse than losing your mother? Perhaps only losing your husband, daughter or both, she thought. She tried to imagine how it would feel to lose both her mother and father in the same year. The thought was unbearable.

In the distance a figure walking toward her caught her attention. It was a man wearing a long dark coat and an old-fashioned bowler hat. An expression  of alarm crossed Katie’s face as she realized that this was the man that had approached her and Shannon on the boardwalk. She quickened her pace and turned down a side street, hoping to avoid him altogether. When she looked around again, however, he was right behind her. A chill went up Katie’s spine as he drew closer, and then his face came into view.

“Hello, Miss Matthews,” the man said with a smile.

The sound of her name coming from his mouth made her stomach lurch nervously, and she looked about wildly for some way to escape.

“We don’t have much time, so I must be brief. You have done well in following my instructions so far, but you still have much to learn,” the man said. “I will meet you tomorrow at the beach at exactly ten o’clock. You must ask me what you want to know, no matter how many times I tell you that it is not possible. Do you understand?”

Katie nodded her head slowly, afraid to speak. The man placed his hand on Katie’s shoulder and then disappeared into thin air. She couldn’t tell if he had vanished or if she had been tricked, but he was gone and she was left alone on the sidewalk.

“Katie?” Shannon called quietly from a few feet away. “Are you all right?” Katie turned to see Shannon standing in the empty lot across the street.

“I… I saw someone,” Katie said, looking nervously over her shoulder. “He looked like a photographer taking pictures of people on the boardwalk. He asked me if we knew who he was, and then he disappeared before I could explain. What was that?”

“I don’t know, but it felt like magic or something. Don’t worry about it for now. Do you want to see my new paintings?” Shannon led the way toward her house and they walked up the steps into Shannon’s attic apartment. When they got there, Shannon showed Katie the paintings that she had done while she was in Paris. To Katie’s amazement, each one was more incredible than the last and each one was different from the others. They were all inspired by her travels, but every single one contained a hidden message that  spoke about life and death.

“You are so talented!” Katie gushed as she examined each painting carefully.

“They are nothing compared to yours! Look at how you captured that moment! It is so real! The water is breaking right before my eyes, Shannon. You need to send it in!”

Shannon smiled proudly and then decided to show Katie her favorite piece. It was called “Mother’s Eyes,” and it was based on the photograph that she had drawn when she was in Paris. It showed a woman with bright blue eyes gazing out at the viewer with love and wonder.

“I like this one best because my mom is looking back at me. She told me once not to forget to see through her eyes. She said that if I did, then I would always be able to see her again whenever I wanted,” Shannon said as she stared at the painting with a sad smile.

“Shannon, this is beautiful. You have to keep painting. I think it is what your mom would want you to do,” Katie said as she put her hand on Shannon’s shoulder.

Shannon nodded and then took a deep breath. She knew that Katie was right. It was time to get back to work.",1
"John Doe, the serial killer, tells Valerie that she must escape the basement before dawn or else she will become his next trophy.","her to reach. Valerie turned around and started to walk back towards the door she had entered through.

As Valerie walked, she noticed that the musty smell that had been bothering her seemed to be getting stronger. She also noticed a faint noise coming from somewhere in the basement; it almost sounded like someone humming.  Valerie ignored the noises for a while until she realized that they might be another source of help. Perhaps the person behind the humming could help her escape from this basement, provided it was safe to reveal herself to him or her.

Valerie decided that she needed to see who was in the basement with her, even if it meant risking an encounter with John Doe. She would rather have an ally at her side than to be alone in this dark basement.

Valerie continued walking towards the humming sound, but as she tried to get closer, she stumbled over a piece of furniture and fell over. Valerie quickly got up and realized that she was standing right next to the source of the humming noise. It was a man who was sitting down on a wooden chair with his back facing towards her. He had shoulder-length black hair and was wearing a black t-shirt with an image of a skull on it and some blue jeans. Another thing Valerie noticed about the man was that he seemed to be wearing a pair of gloves, but the ends of his fingertips were cut off.

The man turned around and looked at Valerie. He then extended his hand to help her up and said, “Are you all right?” 

Valerie accepted the man’s hand and used it to stand back up. She then said, “Yes, I’m fine. I was just looking for someone in this basement and almost tripped over your chair.”

John Doe looked a little surprised by what Valerie said, but then responded by saying, “I’m sorry about that. My name is John Doe. Who are you?”

Valerie was relieved that the man could talk and didn’t seem to be bothered by it too much, so she said, “I’m Valerie Marx. I had a friend who used to live here, and I came back here a couple of days ago to visit him. I guess he didn’t tell me that he sold the house. He’s a real jerk sometimes.”

John Doe put his hands in his pockets and said, “I can understand how that can be frustrating. All right, it’s getting late and we should get some rest. We can talk more tomorrow if you’d like to, but for now, let’s go back into that other room and try to get some sleep.”

Valerie looked at John Doe in disbelief, but then asked, “Well, I suppose that would be logical. What’s your name?”

“For now, I’m just John Doe. But don’t worry, you’ll find out my name soon enough. Now let’s get going. You don’t want to attract any attention from the neighbors; they might call the police and I really don’t want to be arrested for trespassing.”

Valerie was taken aback by John Doe’s answer, but followed his lead and went back into the little room. She was exhausted, so she laid down upon the old mattress and quickly fell asleep.

When Valerie woke up, she found herself on the floor with her hands tied behind her back, still locked in the handcuffs. In desperation, she tried to kick and move about in order to free herself but it did no good. That’s when she realized that her feet were also tied together and that the carpet prevented her from moving about even if she was able to free her hands. 

“Hello, Valerie. I hope you slept well. Now let’s get going so you can avoid this place before your captor wakes up. I’d really like to keep our relationship friendly and so I’m giving you a head start before I come after you.  Please don’t try anything stupid, such as trying to run away with me in this basement because then my patience will run out and I don’t think you’d like the outcome. So please try to run away from this place before dawn, okay?”  John Doe spoke in a calm voice, but his words were laced with menace.

Valerie was unsure what to make of this situation. She couldn’t see anything and she didn’t even know how she got here. If John Doe could provide her with a head start, then maybe he could help her to escape the basement. So Valerie nodded slowly, not saying anything.

Without any further words from John Doe, she heard footsteps coming up behind her before she felt something soft and spongy being draped over her face. For a moment, Valerie blacked out, but when she regained consciousness and took a breath, she smelled an overwhelming smell of disinfectant.

“That smell…” Valerie thought to herself. “It smells like the medical supply room in the basement at my school. But… But I was just in my dorm room about an hour ago. I remember turning off the light and",0
Daisy ultimately beats cancer and her story inspires hope in her community.,"?” Lisa was really crying now, and Daisy was comforted by her daughter’s tears.

“That will never happen,” she said. “I have faith in the doctors and my own determination not to give up. I know that God won’t let me down. He must have a plan for me. And besides, I’ll still be here with you, and we could get through this together.”

“I know you’re right,” responded Lisa slowly drying her eyes. “Now if you can just get the rest of the town to believe it, everything will be fine.”

Daisy laughed lightly. She then continued, “My friends and neighbors are doing their best to be supportive. But they all seem to have a hard time believing it too. I just wish they would…”

Lisa interrupted her. “What if they had seen what you’ve seen? Your treatments were so painful and debilitating at times that I would literally have to pull you through the house on your stomach so that you wouldn’t fall down. One of the worst days was when they made you stand up after you’d been lying flat on your back all day. I had to hold onto your arms and pull you to your feet. I thought we were going to have a nervous breakdown right there in the hospital room.”

“I remember,” replied Daisy quietly smiling. “But those days are over now, and the only thing that really worries me is whether I’ll be able to work here at the store when my treatments are over with. They’re so complicated and exacting that I just don’t know. But as long as I can take care of my own…”

Daisy paused for a moment. Then she lifted her head and gazed straight at Lisa. “Thank you for being here for me, baby; I couldn’t have made it without you. And it means so much to me that you believe I’ll come back from this. I don’t know how well you know Evelyn Chambers, but she’s the only other person that I can think of who would have such faith in me. She’s got a lot more of it than you do. You should talk to her sometime. She knows I ’ll come back, too.”

Lisa said nothing.

Her mother had become very quiet again, and she stood up slowly, took a few steps across the room, and sat down on the long couch. She picked up the remote control lying next to her glass of iced tea, clicked it on, and watched the TV screen.

Lisa sat down beside her mother. She reached out and took Daisy’s hand. The younger woman was surprised at how hot it felt in her own. As they watched the TV, she said, “Mom, I’m worried about what will happen if you don’t come back. I will be all alone.”

Daisy looked over at her gently and squeezed Lisa’s hand. “I know, baby—it’s so hard on you to have me so sick like this. But I’ll be home on Saturday. You will see.”

Lisa moved her mouth and made noises, but no sound came out of her throat. She couldn’t say anything, not even the things she had been rehearsing in her mind for days on end, but now that she was here, right next to her, she could not make them come out.

She moved her hand from Daisy’s and put it on her own face, feeling the coldness of the skin through the thin cotton of her T-shirt. Her eyes were red; she could just make them out in the dim light. She moved her hand slowly down to the side of her neck, and then she touched the long scar that ran from her collarbone to below her ear. She did not move it away right away, but just traced over its length gently with her fingers.

She moved her hand away to look at it, and then moved her head slightly one way and then the other so she could see it from the left and then from the right.

“It’s so big, honey—it looks like a snake bite. They said the scar would go away in a few months, but it has been a year now, and it looks the same. I think they must have been wrong and that it will always look like that.” She moved her head back to look at her mother and smiled. “But you know what’s weird? I don’t even notice it anymore. It just blends in with everything  else on my body.”

Her mother smiled at her, and then she took Daisy’s hand again. Her skin felt soft and warm, like a rose petal. Daisy closed her eyes for a second and felt the heat rising through her body.

“You know,” she continued, “I was so scared at first. But here I am a year later—cancer free—and that fear has completely disappeared. There are no more shadows on the horizon now that I have beaten the thing that was trying to kill me. And it wouldn’t be possible without all of you.”

She moved her head around in a circle, and everyone in the Mayberry community who had prayed for her or helped in any way stood up from where they were seated and cheered. She stood as well, and the group circled around her with smiles on their faces. Some of them brought their hands together in prayer, while others moved to give Daisy a hug or shake her hand.

“Thank you all so much,” she said when the parade had finally ended and everyone had returned to their seats. “You really don’t know how much this means to me. I am so amazed by all of the support I have gotten from Mayberry.

The townspeople and the people here in this square have helped me in ways that I never thought were possible, and for that I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. And for those of you who haven’t had the chance yet, there is still time to join Mayberry in their fight against cancer. You can join us on May 12th at 11 AM at Mayberry Square as we host Walk-a-Thon, which is a fundraiser for local cancer patients. We will have t-shirts and balloons available for purchase, so be sure to come down and support Mayberry.

The next few days were filled with visitors coming to see Daisy in the Mayberry Square. People came from miles away just to shake her hand and tell her how much they admired her. She happily talked with everyone, and gave each person words of encouragement as she had been doing for the last few days.

Mayberry Square was not the only place that was filled with visitors who had come to see Daisy; her home was also filled with visitors every day. Among the guests were many of those who had prayed for her during her  battle with cancer and were relieved to see that their prayers had been answered. While some of the visitors were there to pay their respects, others came out of curiosity and just wanted to catch a glimpse of Daisy in person.

Daisy Mayberry was truly a hero, an inspiration to millions of people who watched her story with cancer unfold. Her story had become known worldwide, thanks to the internet and television. While she was not the only one in her community who had been stricken with cancer, she was definitely the most popular of them all.

A few years past after Daisy had beaten cancer and things were going as usual. She was happy to be alive, and very proud of herself for beating the disease. She had many ideas about how to help others with their problems, and decided that it was time to put those ideas into action.

The first thing she did was open up her own web site so that people from across the country and around the world could get in touch with her. She often received letters from cancer patients who were seeking advice about how to survive a cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment.

She then established a non profit organization with the goal of providing aid to those in need. At first, the organization was called “Daisy’s Daisy Foundation”, in memory of her deceased pet dog. Over time, the name was changed to “The Mayberry Community Outreach”.

The non profit organization offered a broad range of services. The help that she offered ranged from financial assistance, to emotional counseling, to spiritual guidance. She also taught classes about how to cope with the stress of having cancer and provided educational materials about how to prevent the disease.

Over time, people from all over the world started looking up to her as an inspiration, especially those who had been diagnosed with cancer. As a result of her story they never lost hope and were determined to overcome their illness.

Even though she was not a medical professional by any stretch of the imagination, she was happy to share her own experiences and provide support in whatever way she could. She knew from personal experience how tough it was to deal with cancer on your own. She knew what it was like to lose all hope and become depressed when the fight against cancer seemed hopeless. And she knew that there were not enough resources in her community to help those who needed it.

She also knew firsthand how hard it was for family members to care for a loved one who is going through a long, debilitating illness. She was determined to do whatever she could to ease the burden for those who were struggling.

The Mayberry community was truly blessed to have Daisy Mayberry as their neighbor and friend.",1
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,"authors and musicians.

Aimee’s eyes lit up at being able to talk about books and movies with someone else who loved them as much as she did, but Kyle was having a hard time getting into it. He wanted to be listening and watching a movie at the same time, and he was finding it hard to do both at the same time.

Kyle Johnson took out a packet of candy from his jacket pocket and offered Aimee some. They sat in silence for a few moments while munching on their treats, each lost in their own thoughts. Aimee finally spoke. “I struggle with connecting to people,” she said. “There’s a lot of things I want to share about myself, but I don’t know who I can talk to about them. And sometimes I worry that no one will understand what I have to say.” 

Kyle was silent for a moment. “I know how that feels,” he said softly.

“It must be really difficult being in advertising,” Aimee said. “You have to deal with a lot of people all the time, and if you can’t connect with them… I just couldn’t do that. I would be terrible at it.”

“Like you said, it is a struggle,” Kyle said slowly. “And sometimes I wonder if it’s worth it. But then I feel selfish for  feeling that way because I do enjoy the job.” He paused and looked at Aimee, who was studying the TV intently. “But as you said, when it comes to life in general, I have a hard time connecting with people.”

Aimee glanced up at Kyle. She felt grateful to him for listening and not interrupting her. “I don’t mean this in a bad way, Kyle, but you seem like the kind of guy who doesn’t care about what people think of him. You never seem to  worry about what other people are thinking of you.”

Kyle nodded slowly. “I suppose that’s true, but I can sense when I’m being judged by other people, even if it’s not obvious. And it makes me feel alone in the world. It drives me nuts and sometimes I feel like I want to run away.”

Aimee felt a pang in her chest. She had never shared this feeling with anyone before, and she was startled to hear Kyle admit he felt the same way. Kyle seemed so calm and confident when he talked about his feelings. He really understood what Aimee was saying, which made her feel even more isolated from the world than before. She was still clutching her old teddy bear in her hands. “Sometimes I wish I could be like you, Kyle. Sometimes I feel like I’m stuck inside my own head and the world is a big scary place and I just want to hide under my bed or something. Sometimes I feel like when I’m alone, that no one really cares about me and it makes me sad.”",1
"Shannon commits suicide, leaving her husband and young son behind.","’t mind that I brought him home with me.”

The words that came out of Rick Barton’s mouth next completely caught Shannon off-guard.

“I sure am glad to see you, boy! Looks like we finally have a decent man for my daughter to marry!”

Brad just smiled slightly and nodded his head as his father continued to talk.

“Dad? I didn’t know you were coming to town today. Where is Mom? Why didn’t she come pick me up at the airport?”

Shannon felt like her heart had just been ripped from her chest and was beating somewhere on the floor in front of her. The look on Brad’s face was one of utter confusion and hurt. Shannon couldn’t stand it anymore and turned to go back to the kitchen. She needed a drink.

Brad grabbed her arm before she could walk away and swung her around to face him.

“What is wrong with you, Shannon? Why did you tell Dad that we were married? And why didn’t you tell me that he was coming here today? I thought we were going to have a nice weekend, just the two of us.”

Shannon couldn’t speak for a second as she struggled with the words that would come out of her mouth.

“I am sorry, Brad. I just wanted us to spend some time alone together, and I thought if I told your Dad that we were married, he would let you come stay over here tonight. I didn’t think he would think that I was trying to seduce you into—into anything else.”

Brad’s face darkened a bit as he studied Shannon’s face. He looked like he wanted to believe what she was saying, but deep down, Shannon knew that Brad didn’t. Finally, Brad let go of her arm and looked away from her.

He said nothing as he watched the tears begin to roll down her face. “I can’t do this,” he finally said. “I can’t keep lying to my Dad, and I can’t keep hiding this marriage from him. You need to leave now.”

Shannon looked up at him and wiped the tears off of her cheeks with the sleeve of her sweatshirt . “Please, Brad,” she began with a tremble in her voice. “Please don’t do this to me. You know that I love you, and I want us to be together. Don’t you want that too?”

Brad looked over at her with a pleading look on his face. “I do,” he said softly. “But my Dad means so much to me, and I can’t hurt him like this. Please, Shannon. You have to leave now. He’s going to be home any minute.”

Shannon wiped her tears away and tried not to let him see the hurt look on her face. “Okay,” she whispered, “I understand. I only wish that you could love me enough to fight for us.”

Brad looked at her in sadness and regret. “I do love you, honey,” he said with a sigh. “But if this is how it has to be, then it’s okay. You have to go now before my Dad gets here. I have to talk to him.”

Shannon nodded and said, “I’ll go, but don’t say that you love me unless you mean it. I can’t stand this kind of mixed message from you any more. If you want me to continue loving you, then call your Dad and tell him that you can’t see him tonight. Please, do this for me, just once.”

Brad looked down at his feet for a few seconds and then up into her eyes again. “Okay,” he said with a small grin, “I will. I guess the three of us can spend the evening together after all.”

Shannon held back the tears that were threatening to spill over again. “Thank you,” she whispered and kissed him softly on the cheek. She then turned and walked out of the room without looking back. As she reached the front door, she stopped and took a deep breath. She wondered if she should leave a note for Brad’s Dad to read or just let him be surprised by what had happened. Then a small smile crossed her lips as she remembered what he had told her about his own father never letting him  have what he wanted. This would be payback time for Brad, and it felt good to know that she was going to be there when it happened.

Shannon walked down the hallway toward the bathroom and passed her bedroom door as she did so. She looked inside at Jeremy who was now sitting up in bed, looking around him with a confused expression on his face. Shannon smiled at her young son and then continued on to the bathroom. She glanced at her reflection in the mirror as she entered and then turned toward the medicine cabinet on the wall beside it. She opened the cabinet door, reached inside, and slowly pulled out a small bottle of prescription sleeping pills that had been prescribed to her for the depression that she had been battling since Brad’s infidelity had come to light. She removed the bottle’s blue cap and shook two pills into her hand.

She glanced one last time at Jeremy, who was now looking worriedly at her. She smiled at him once more before turning toward the toilet and tossing the pills into it. She then returned to the medicine cabinet and replaced the bottle of sleeping pills in its original place before returning to her bedroom.

Shannon walked over to where Jeremy still sat in his bed and knelt down beside him. She gently lifted his arm off of the pillow and began stroking the skin of his forearm with her fingers. He looked down at her and smiled.

“Mom, what are you doing?” he asked.

“Sweetie, I love you so much. You know that, right?” she asked him.

Jeremy nodded his head.

Shannon reached out with her hand and placed it on Jeremy’s belly before leaning forward and lightly kissing the top of his head. “You have made me so happy,” she said softly as she opened her arms to embrace him.

Jeremy wrapped his arms tightly around Shannon’s waist and buried his face into her shoulder as she continued to lovingly stroke his arm.

After a few more moments, Shannon pulled herself away from Jeremy and stood up. She reached into the pocket of her robe and pulled out a piece of paper and a pen.

“Jeremy, sweetie, I need to write something down, okay?” she asked him. “And you have to promise not to look away from me like last time.”

Jeremy nodded his head. Shannon gently grabbed Jeremy by  the shoulders and made eye contact with him. She smiled and said, “I love you,” before turning around and dropping to her knees on the floor.

Shannon began writing on the paper as quietly as she could while looking over her shoulder at Jeremy, who was staring at her intently. After a few moments, Shannon took the pen back out of her mouth and carefully folded the paper before returning it to her pocket.

At that moment, Brad walked into the bedroom and was startled to see Shannon crouched down on the floor. He rushed over to her and asked what was wrong.

“I’ve done something really stupid, Brad!” she cried tearfully, looking up at him. “I drank some pills and I just had a really bad thought, but it’s not going to happen. I’m not going to do it. I couldn’t leave you. I could never do that to Jeremy.”

Brad stood there with his mouth hanging open, unable to speak. Shannon struggled to pull herself up off the floor and Brad quickly reached out and wrapped his arms around her, cradling her in his arms.

“You had me so worried,” Brad said, trying to catch his breath. “I didn’t know what the hell I was going to do if you died. I would have been completely alone. And I don’t think that we would have made it without you.",1

She stood as well, and the group circled around her with smiles on their faces. Some of them brought their hands together in prayer, while others moved to give Daisy a hug or shake her hand.

“Thank you all so much,” she said when the parade had finally ended and everyone had returned to their seats. “You really don’t know how much this means to me. I am so amazed by all of the support I have gotten from Mayberry.

The townspeople and the people here in this square have helped me in ways that I never thought were possible, and for that I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. And for those of you who haven’t had the chance yet, there is still time to join Mayberry in their fight against cancer. You can join us on May 12th at 11 AM at Mayberry Square as we host Walk-a-Thon, which is a fundraiser for local cancer patients. We will have t-shirts and balloons available for purchase, so be sure to come down and support Mayberry.

The next few days were filled with visitors coming to see Daisy in the Mayberry Square. People came from miles away just to shake her hand and tell her how much they admired her. She happily talked with everyone, and gave each person words of encouragement as she had been doing for the last few days.

Mayberry Square was not the only place that was filled with visitors who had come to see Daisy; her home was also filled with visitors every day. Among the guests were many of those who had prayed for her during her  battle with cancer and were relieved to see that their prayers had been answered. While some of the visitors were there to pay their respects, others came out of curiosity and just wanted to catch a glimpse of Daisy in person.

Daisy Mayberry was truly a hero, an inspiration to millions of people who watched her story with cancer unfold. Her story had become known worldwide, thanks to the internet and television. While she was not the only one in her community who had been stricken with cancer, she was definitely the most popular of them all.

A few years past after Daisy had beaten cancer and things were going as usual. She was happy to be alive, and very proud of herself for beating the disease. She had many ideas about how to help others with their problems, and decided that it was time to put those ideas into action.

The first thing she did was open up her own web site so that people from across the country and around the world could get in touch with her. She often received letters from cancer patients who were seeking advice about how to survive a cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment.

She then established a non profit organization with the goal of providing aid to those in need. At first, the organization was called “Daisy’s Daisy Foundation”, in memory of her deceased pet dog. Over time, the name was changed to “The Mayberry Community Outreach”.

The non profit organization offered a broad range of services. The help that she offered ranged from financial assistance, to emotional counseling, to spiritual guidance. She also taught classes about how to cope with the stress of having cancer and provided educational materials about how to prevent the disease.

Over time, people from all over the world started looking up to her as an inspiration, especially those who had been diagnosed with cancer. As a result of her story they never lost hope and were determined to overcome their illness.

Even though she was not a medical professional by any stretch of the imagination, she was happy to share her own experiences and provide support in whatever way she could. She knew from personal experience how tough it was to deal with cancer on your own. She knew what it was like to lose all hope and become depressed when the fight against cancer seemed hopeless. And she knew that there were not enough resources in her community to help those who needed it.

She also knew firsthand how hard it was for family members to care for a loved one who is going through a long, debilitating illness. She was determined to do whatever she could to ease the burden for those who were struggling.

The Mayberry community was truly blessed to have Daisy Mayberry as their neighbor and friend.",1
"Kyle Johnson, a man Aimee met at work, comes over to visit and the two quickly become friends.","knock on the door. Aimee didn’t realize she had been daydreaming until her
   friend asked her that question. “Yeah, I was just thinking about the first
   night I spent in this apartment,” she answered. The woman walked into her
   living room and noticed how the furniture had changed. “Who is all this stuff
   for?”
   “For you, Liz! I want you to come stay with me next summer, so I’m going to
   start getting things ready. I got a new bed and a new couch, since the old
   ones were pretty beat up. They had been here for years.” She looked at her
   friend in earnest. “You can sleep on the couch, and I’ll have the bed to
   myself.”
   “But what about Kyle?” Elizabeth asked, an eyebrow raised. It was obvious
   to Aimee that she wanted to try her luck with the guy.
   “Kyle’s out of my life, remember?” Aimee said defensively. “How does this
   furniture look? I think I might get some art for the walls today, since the
   frames are all black. Do you like it so far?” She looked at her friend, who
   was still looking at the couch. “C’mon Liz, your turn.” The woman waited for
   her to play, but she just sat on the couch and stared at Aimee expectantly.
   “Oh!” She suddenly said with a grin. “I see what you’re doing! You need to
   get an art print up on the wall here, and then when Kyle comes over for
   dinner, he’ll say in a casual way, ‘Hey, nice artwork’ and then you can say
   something back to him like, ‘Thanks, that’s from my favorite artist; I was
   lucky to be able to see an original print.’ Get it?” She was beaming with
   excitement. Aimee felt a little uncomfortable with the direction  their
   discussion was going. “I might not see Kyle again,” she said more forcefully.
   “He hasn’t called me back since that night at the party, so I doubt he wants
   to go out with me again. I don’t really care; I just want him to leave me
   alone.” The woman looked genuinely disappointed and sat down next to Aimee,
   leaning her own head back as she did so. She put her hands in her lap and
   didn’t say anything for a moment. “You’re wrong,” she said at last. “Kyle
   Johnson doesn’t want to leave you alone; he wants to get back together with
   you. He just doesn’t know how to go about it. If you want him out of your
   life, then you should take steps to make that happen—like not answering the
   door when he knocks.” “I want to be nice, but I don’t want to be a doormat!”
   Aimee said hotly. “I don’t know what to do.” “If you were just friends before
   tonight, then act like a friend. Let him in and talk to him. And let me talk
   to him too.” Aimee just looked at the other woman, then sighed. “Why did I
   tell you all this? You don’t even know Kyle!” “Lizzy, please, call me Liz. 
   And I may not know him, but I do know you. And I’ll tell you that something
   about Kyle really appeals to you. You still have feelings for him.” Aimee
   thought about this for a moment, then sighed. “You’re right, I do feel something
   for him, but he doesn’t. Do you think he just feels awkward about the kiss?
   I mean, he called me beautiful and all that—I just don’t understand what
   he’s going through.” “Well, come on in and ask him! Let me talk to him too.
   Maybe if we both do, we can figure it out. I bet he had a good time with us
   the other night, and he wants to explore it some more.” Aimee’s eyes lit up at
   this thought, and she picked up the phone to call Kyle. Before she could
   dial however, her cell buzzed with a text message from Kyle.  Aimee looked
   at the screen and groaned. It was a photo of the two of them making out in
   front of Liz’s building the night before. She looked at it with anger, then
   put down the phone and sighed. As she started to get up, she noticed that it
   was getting dark outside. “Shit,” she muttered. “I need to get ready for
   work—I’m late! Thanks for the advice, though. You were right—I need to talk
   to him.” Kyle gave her a smile and walked down the hall towards the stairs.
   Aimee stayed at her seat, trying to call him back but his number went straight
   to voicemail. She pulled up a chair and sat back down at her desk. She",0

A group of survivors find themselves in a strange new world where they must band together to survive the perils that await them.,"She opened one of them to reveal it was filled with water.

“I don’t think that will go bad in a few days,” said Maria. “Even if it does, there is plenty more where that came from. We might be gone for a while before we find somewhere to settle down.”

Sarah nodded again and placed the bottles back on the table before grabbing her coat and putting it on. She then picked up her backpack and slung it over her shoulder before she started to follow her mother toward the door.

Maria took Sarah’s hand after they reached the street and walked slowly towards the end of their block where both could see a gaping hole in the ground that had swallowed the houses on either side of them.

As soon as they reached it, Maria turned and looked toward Sarah, who also turned her head to look. Maria then quickly pushed Sarah away from her and pulled her arm out of her grasp before she started to run toward the edge of the broken road and jumped down into the pit.

Sarah screamed in terror, but Maria did not seem to hear as she disappeared completely down the chasm. Sarah cried out again as she watched her mother’s figure move slowly further down.

“Mama! Mama!” she cried, desperate to stop her descent. She ran to the edge of the pit and looked down into its emptiness before she fell to her knees crying, “Mommy! Oh God! Mommy!”

She covered her face and rocked back and forth on the ground. Then she sat up and wiped the tears from her face. She shook her head and forced herself to stand up. She then turned around and looked at what she had done as she screamed again in horror.

Her body was now slumped over what had been the pit, and her face was hidden within the pool of blood spreading from her neck. She slowly rolled off of it and fell to the side with an empty expression on her dead face.

Sarah screamed loudly when she saw the blood, but she didn’t seem to notice for a moment that her mother was slumped over and motionless as she stared in horror at the pool of blood that surrounded her body.

Then she screamed out again when she finally realized that her mother was dead. She screamed for a few more moments before she started to cry again. 

The only thing that kept her from collapsing and falling to the side in a dead faint was the fact that she had no time to do so. She would have to help her friends survive or else she would die with them.

She turned around once and saw that there was no one else behind her on the other side of the pit, so she turned back to face the opposite direction and started to run in that direction. She was running for what seemed like hours before she finally came out from within the woods and into a field.

She looked around in a panic and then stopped when she saw a pile of rubble. She started to run towards it and then reached it and slid down it to the ground before she sat down next to it.

She was exhausted and weak from having just gone through the traumatic event of watching her mother get killed and then spending what seemed like hours running for her life through the forest before finally coming out into a field.

She sat in shock and fear of what might happen next for only a few moments before she pulled herself back up onto her feet and started to look around for somewhere to hide. She saw no one nearby, so she started to walk around the field in search of anything that she could find to use as a weapon.

Her eyes widened when something moved under the pile of rubble that she had just jumped down from, so she started to run in its direction and then stopped when it suddenly raised itself up from the ground and looked at her.

She gasped in fear when she saw it was an enormous mutated insect that had large horns on its head and wings on its back, while two smaller versions of the same insect stood next to it. It hissed out in a deep voice before moving towards her with its two smaller insects by his side.

Barely holding onto any semblance of sanity, she tried in vain to run away from them when they caught up and surrounded her. She then screamed in terror as the huge insect that she had seen earlier began to lower its head down towards her face.

She was paralyzed with fear and horror at what she saw about to happen to her when a loud booming sound came from above her, causing the large insect to stop and look up while it struggled against whatever was attacking it.

The two smaller insects stood next to the big one began to walk away, but stopped when they heard something else above them. They looked up with their heads raised in the air as whatever attacked them flew past  and then suddenly dropped down towards them.

The smaller insects immediately started to run away from it as they shrieked, while the large insect that was facing Maria let out a loud shriek before rearing back and taking off into the sky.

She let out a deep sigh of relief when it was gone and she managed to stop shaking as she began to regain her breath. She then turned around to see a figure standing at the edge of the forest entrance near her.

He had his hands on his hips while he grinned down at her, causing her to take a step backwards in fear. She then realized that he wasn’t an insect and he was wearing dark clothing, so she relaxed her stance.

She then looked up into his blue eyes and felt herself relax even further when she recognized who it was. He then gave her a warm smile before walking towards her with his hands outstretched towards her.

Maria’s eyes widened in surprise when she heard the footsteps approaching, but then relaxed again when she saw that it was Peter. She then gave him a bright smile as she reached out to embrace him, but he pulled away from her.

“Are you ok?” he asked as he looked down at the ground where she had been sitting.

She nodded in response to his question and reached out her hand towards him in a gesture of friendship. He shook her hand before giving her an inquisitive look.

“What were you doing over there?” he asked.

She smiled warmly at him as she gestured towards the pile of rubble. She then pointed towards the forest. He then nodded in response to her question and smiled warmly at her.

“Yeah, I know what you mean,” he said before chuckling slightly. Then he looked up into the sky as if searching for something.

“At least this time we’re not stuck in an underground shelter,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I feel so free being able to see the sky again.”

She laughed and nodded in agreement before glancing around her. She then pointed towards some of the wreckage that lay around them.

“I wonder how all of this got here,” she said curiously as she glanced around at the scattered remains of aircraft and other vehicles. She then crouched down  on the ground beside him and looked up at the sky again. She was about to say something, but suddenly stopped as she noticed that some of the birds in the air were starting to circle around them.

Peter looked up at the birds that were circling above them and then looked at her curiously. He then pointed towards the sky.

She lowered her hand from pointing into a fist and raised it up off of the ground as she watched some of them come closer to them. Then, she began to smile before pointing at one of the birds. He looked up at her again before looking back into the sky.

He didn’t seem alarmed at all, but instead seemed amused by what was going on. She watched as the bird flew closer to them both before landing on his shoulder. She then giggled happily as she looked up at him while he continued to smile down at her. She then glanced over at the other birds before raising one of her hands up and letting out a loud yell.

This caused the other birds to fly away from them and she smiled before crouching down next to him again. She then watched as he picked the bird off of his shoulder and held it out in front of him.

He then looked down at her and grinned as he extended the bird out towards her. She then smiled at him and laughed before reaching out her hand towards him. Her smile widened as his eyes looked into hers, but then she frowned when he suddenly looked down at the bird in his hands. She quickly placed her hand back onto the ground and tried to stand up on her own before looking back up at him.

She then looked down towards the bird as she frowned before trying to sit back down after he let go of her arm. He then smiled as he slowly reached out his hand and helped her up, causing her to look at him with a smile on her face again.

She then looked around the immediate area before looking back at him. She felt a momentary flicker of fear before noticing that he seemed unafraid. He was still smiling at her warmly, and she felt comforted by his presence in her life.

He then suddenly looked up at the sky and yelled out before pointing at something behind her. She turned around to look, and her eyes widened when she saw that it was a jet plane. She instinctively crouched down and pulled back as the jet flew over their heads, heading in the  direction of the ocean. She then looked up at him as he grinned at her, and she smiled back as she slowly stood up again.

She then watched him once again as he put his arm around her shoulder and leaned against her for a moment before looking back out towards the ocean. He noticed that a pod of whales had moved into it, and he pointed at them before pointing to the plane again.

She then looked towards it as she thought about what it meant for planes to no longer exist. She then looked back at him before hearing a noise behind her. She immediately turned around and saw two men with guns approaching them. She instinctively pulled him down before she looked back at him and saw that he was unafraid of what was about to happen.

The men saw that they were alone, and one of them yelled out for the other one before raising his gun at him. She suddenly realized that he would probably kill him, but she also understood that he had not come up with a plan yet. She then slowly stood up and held out her hand as she slowly walked towards the men, who looked both confused and suspicious.

She smiled to herself when she heard them both speaking in Spanish, and decided to use it as an advantage. She slowly stopped approaching them as she put her hand on her stomach and dropped down to the ground in pain. The two men walked over to her and one of them offered his hand to help her up, but she shook her head no.

She then noticed that they were scared when they suddenly saw a small pack of coyotes approaching them, and she used their fears to calm them down. She slowly got up and saw how surprised the two men looked at her, and she smiled before walking towards the fire again.

She looked towards him again before seeing the look of sheer terror on his face as he watched the giant birds circling above them. She giggled and looked around at the other men, who were watching him with amusement. She then slowly walked over to him and smiled as she gently touched his arm and bent down to speak into his ear.

She saw that he was confused by what she had said until he heard the  sound of wings approaching, and he looked up at the trees above them to see several large birds flying towards them. She then leaned back and shook her head before giggling when she suddenly saw the look of horror on his face, which made her laugh out loud.

She then looked up at the sky again and couldn’t believe her eyes when she saw a giant plane flying towards them. The plane got lower and lower before finally landing in front of them with a loud noise. She slowly walked over to the plane and looked at it with amazement as she saw the door open and several men getting out of the plane.

She looked back at the others, and they were all looking at her nervously before she turned back and started walking towards it. She smiled when she saw the look of anger on the man’s face as he started to stutter before finally saying, “Wh-what are you do-doing?”

The men who had just gotten out of the plane smiled when they heard his question and walked over to her as she continued to smile. They then turned around and looked at the man, who was completely stunned by their appearance. Maria Martinez was a beautiful young woman, who had short brown hair and light brown skin. Her body was covered by a loose-fitting top that opened in the front to show off her breasts and abdomen, which was partially covered by some tight bluejeans. She smiled when she saw that they were all staring at her with lust in their eyes. She then turned back around and started speaking to them in their own language to calm them down before she continued, “We’re not going to hurt you, but we do need your help.”

Maria Martinez was one of the leaders of this group of survivors, who had gotten separated from the others in a previous battle with some of the survivors that had been left behind. The man nodded his head, which calmed Maria Martinez’s nerves before she continued to speak to them, “Do you understand what I said? We are not going to hurt you.” She then looked at them and realized that they were all getting increasingly nervous, so she giggled before she continued, “We just want to get away from those people who chased us here. Please help us get away from them!”

The man nodded his head and Maria Martinez smiled in relief before she",0
"Daisy's daughter, Lisa, becomes her primary caregiver and works tirelessly to find a treatment that will save her mother's life.","on the water and Daisy began to wash herself as Lisa stood there holding a towel for her.

Lisa kept thinking about how lucky she was to have known her mother all these years. She told Daisy that she loved her so much and that she was going to do everything in her power to make sure that Daisy got better.

Daisy continued washing herself and Lisa stood there, thinking about what she could do to help her mother. She knew that they couldn’t just sit back and rely on the doctors to treat her. If they did, then Daisy would just spend the rest of her time here in this bed just drifting away until she breathed her last breath.

Then Lisa had a thought. There was this new drug that was being used by doctors to treat acute myeloid leukemia. It wasn’t approved for use by the FDA yet but it was being tried on people with severe cases, like Daisy’s. One of the doctors she knew told her that it would be available to doctors in a few months, but not much longer than that.

Lisa thought about the drug and how she could access it now instead of waiting a few more months. She immediately picked up the phone and dialed a number that she knew by heart. It was for the hospital’s drug rep who was in charge of procuring the new drug for their doctors to use.

In just a few minutes, a young woman who worked for the company arrived at Lisa’s office. “Lisa Chambers? I’m here to talk to you about obtaining some of the new leukemia drug,” she said as she walked in. “My name is Tanya and I’ll be your contact person for this project.”

Lisa introduced herself and then she explained how her mother had recently been diagnosed with AML. She told Tanya about the new drug and how it was being used in several other states, but not yet in Iowa.

“My mother is at high risk for a recurrence of her cancer, so I’m desperate to have this drug available right away. We don’t have much time to waste.”

The young woman looked surprised by Lisa’s desperation and she said, “You know this drug was just approved by the FDA two weeks ago, don’t you? It will take a little while before it is made available to patients like your mother.”  She paused and then added, “But I can assure you we are working on that right now.”

As the young woman talked about the difficulties of getting drugs approved and made available for doctors to prescribe, Lisa listened intently and nodded her head. She looked at her watch and exclaimed, “I’m sorry, I really need to go meet with my mother’s doctor now. I have to talk with him about the experimental treatment he wants to try on my mother. But please let me know as soon as you can if you decide to approve this drug for my mother. And please, keep my name confidential.”

Lisa took her briefcase in hand and headed toward the hospital. When she entered the ICU she found Dr. Carter at the nurses station, talking on the phone. He turned around when Lisa approached him and said, “I understand you met with the drug representative today. I called your office asking for an update and was told you were here. I’ve been very concerned about Mrs. Mayberry’s progress. She’s been here for a week now without any significant improvement in her condition. I had hoped she would be stronger by now.”

“The drug rep said that you wanted to try an experimental treatment on her,” Lisa said. “Do you think it will help?”

Dr. Carter looked at Lisa and shook his head slowly. “It’s a very risky treatment. I’ve done my best to come up with an alternative treatment, but I have run out of options. We need to do something more aggressive if we hope to see any improvement in your mother’s condition. She has been through so much already — I don’t want to see her suffer anymore. As soon as the drug representative told me about this new treatment, I started the paperwork for approval from our hospital’s medical staff committee. That should be completed by tomorrow. We can start administering the drug as soon as we receive approval. Now that I know you are willing to do this for your mother, I feel much better about trying this.”

Lisa was surprised by Dr. Carter’s assessment of her feelings regarding her mother because he had never mentioned them before. She looked at him and smiled sympathetically. “I just don’t  want her to suffer anymore, either.”

Dr. Carter looked over at Daisy slowly and said sadly, “She is suffering. I can tell that she is uncomfortable even though she has become more alert today. She hasn’t opened her eyes yet, but I know it won’t be long.”

Lisa shook her head in agreement and turned back to the doctor. She was feeling strangely optimistic about her mother’s prospects. If this treatment worked as well as Tanya had indicated, Daisy could start to feel better much sooner than she and the rest of the family had expected. “I am going to check on her now. I’ll see you again tomorrow morning.”

Dr. Carter nodded at her as Lisa left the room, and he returned his attention to Daisy Mayberry. He was happy that Lisa seemed so optimistic about her mother’s prospects for recovery. She was going to need all of the encouragement she could get in the days ahead. He just hoped that Daisy would begin feeling better soon, because he was afraid that her system couldn’t withstand much more of this.

Lisa checked Daisy’s vitals and then sat down in a chair next to her bed. “Mom?” she asked, unsure of whether she needed to speak louder for her mother to hear her. After a moment, Daisy turned her head toward Lisa and opened her eyes. She looked up at Lisa with confusion as she said, “What are you doing standing there? You should be resting.”

Lisa smiled at her. “I am resting. I have a few things that I would like to talk to you about, though. Your doctor just left, and he wants me to check on you again tomorrow morning.”

Daisy seemed confused. “This can’t be good news, then. Are you here to tell me that my treatment isn’t working?”

Lisa shook her head. “No, Mom. It is working as well as we expected it to work, and possibly better. Dr. Carter thinks that the cancer cells just aren’t dying as fast as they should be, which is concerning him a little bit.” She held up the notepad and pen that she had brought with her. Lisa started writing on the pad as she continued talking. “The reason I  wanted to talk about this now is because he wants me to try a new treatment. It is one that was used on mice last year, and it has shown good results for people like you. We are all very excited about trying it out.”

Daisy frowned with confusion, trying to follow the conversation. She was having trouble understanding Lisa, though. “What are you talking about? What is this new treatment?”

Lisa nodded and stopped writing for a moment to look Daisy directly in the eye. “I don’t want to get your hopes up too high, but we have found a new treatment that has worked very well on mice and people. The drug company is sponsoring our first test case, and that is you.”

Daisy felt her excitement quickly turn into disappointment as she processed Lisa’s words. “You’re going to try a new treatment on me, but you don’t know if it will work?”

Lisa shook her head. “It has worked very well so far in the mice and the people who have been treated with it; I am confident that it will work on you as well. The problem is just that we don’t have the research for it yet. So, I am going to tell the drug company that you are interested in using their treatment on your case. That way they will give us more research, and be able to get a better idea of how effective it is. They also might be able to give you an even better version of the drug.”

Daisy pondered Lisa’s words for a moment, then nodded. “I don’t see any other choice at this point, so I agree. Do whatever you have to do, Lisa. I just want to be here with you and your family as much as I can.”

“I promise, I will do everything possible to make sure you are still here,” Lisa said. “I am so sorry that you had to go through this; it is heartbreaking for me to see what this terrible disease is doing to my mom. I am going to keep you updated on how the research is coming. All right?”

Lisa’s parents were standing in the doorway, and Lisa gave them a smile. “Now, where are the twins? We can’t have this serious discussion without them!",1
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"friends, and she had stopped taking part in the activities she used to enjoy doing in her spare time. Shannon was spending more time alone at home because her father didn’t seem interested in doing anything with her, and so it seemed as though she had no one else to turn to but herself. “She’s trying to cope with her loss, and I don’t think she’s learned to do that yet,” Uncle Jeff said.

Shannon was sitting on the edge of her bed, holding a box of oil paints that was given to her by her mother before she passed away from cancer. She started crying uncontrollably once again upon seeing both her uncle and father approach her room slowly. “What are you doing here?” Shannon asked, wiping the tears from her face and standing up. There were paint stains on her cheeks, nose and hands. Her uncle could see that she had been crying for a while.

“I came to talk to you,” her father said.

“About what?” Shannon asked, turning away from them. She started pacing around the room as she spoke. “You don’t care how I feel, so why should I tell you?” she asked.

Her father stepped inside the room and placed a hand on her shoulder. “I do care about how you feel daughter,” he said softly. Her uncle noticed that there were small tears forming in her father’s eyes.

“Yeah, right. If you did care, you wouldn’t have left us all behind to deal with this grief on our own,” she said, turning to face her father directly now. She looked in his eyes and saw that he had started crying now. “He doesn’t care.” She turned to face her uncle now. “You don’t care either, do you?”

Her uncle sighed and shook his head slowly. He did care, but he knew that she wouldn’t believe him just yet. “No, I do care Shannon,” he said gently.

She looked at him for a few moments while the tears continued to fall from her father’s eyes and then nodded and walked over to sit on her bed. The two men stood nearby, unsure of what to do next. Her father was crying now,  so he didn’t know how to handle this situation.

Shannon saw the box of oil paints on her nightstand. She picked it up and opened it slowly, letting the tears continue to stream down her face as she did so. She stared at the empty canvas in front of her for a few moments before she took out a large brush and dipped it into a small jar of red paint. Then, Shannon started to paint.

She started painting out of her own grief and loneliness, but as she worked, she found that somehow painting helped to ease it. She painted for hours and didn’t eat anything. Shannon’s need to paint became so strong that she decided to clear out her attic and turn it into a studio, so that she could paint there whenever she felt like it.

She turned her old wooden desk into a workbench and filled the walls with canvases, paints, brushes, and other painting materials. Shannon moved her easel to the center of the room and placed two chairs in front of it. She hung some potted plants in the corners of the room for decoration purposes. The attic was small, but she didn’t mind that. It was just right for her. It also reminded  her of the attic in the family’s old barn.

Shannon would spend hours in the studio, painting and listening to music on her headphones. She discovered that drawing people helped her to feel connected with her mother once more, and so she would draw portraits of her mother over and over again. The  act of drawing also helped Shannon to cope with her feelings.

Shannon started to put her own feelings into the paintings, too. She could often be found staring at one of her own unfinished paintings, which had two figures standing in a meadow. The figures were very dark and pale, reflecting Shannon’s feelings of being filled with darkness but also feeling a glimmer of light at the same time.

This painting became an outlet for Shannon and she would often sit and stare at it for long periods of time to try to work some of her pain and confusion out on it. Sometimes, she would cover the painted surface with salt and trace the outlines of her paintings in a faint blue wash. This felt like she was connecting with someone, especially since her own mother could no longer speak to her. Shannon felt as if she were having a conversation with her mother by painting the images over and over again. Shannon started to feel closer to her paintings and knew that they helped her to heal.

Shannon painted for hours every day, with only a short break for lunch which she always ate while standing up. She drank a lot of water so that she wouldn’t feel weak or tired. She felt almost as peaceful as when she was painting and felt that it was her therapy. Shannon painted every night until she finished a painting, and then she would start a new one. Sometimes, she would paint for six hours straight without stopping, and this helped to ease the pain in her heart. Sometimes, while painting, Shannon felt like",1
Shannon's paintings help her to deal with her grief and to find a new sense of purpose.,"She was only doing it just to express her feelings, not to make any money. But if she could sell her paintings and make some money, then maybe she could get a studio where she could paint all the time.

“I do think you can sell your paintings if you enter this show,” Katie said. “You have real talent, but you just have to figure out how to get it out there.”

Shannon had never considered that her paintings could be worth any money. She had never thought about selling her paintings. All she wanted to do was paint them for herself and to help her get through her own feelings of loss.

She walked over to the easel and looked at her painting. It was one of the first paintings she had done since her mother had passed away, and it was one of her favorites. It was a portrait of a woman with long black hair, standing with her hands on her hips looking out to sea. It was titled the Sea Witch.

“I like this one too,” Katie said as she walked over to Shannon and looked at the painting. “It reminds me of Rapunzel from that fairy tale we read together when we were younger. Remember how she let down her hair to the prince and he climbed up and rescued her from the tower? That’s what I think this woman is doing—letting down her hair to someone who can rescue her.”

Shannon nodded in agreement. “I think you’re right,” she said as she gazed at the painting. “She’s letting go of her worries and her past and looking towards something better in the future. She has this look on her face as if she is saying: I hope someone can save me from my troubles.”

Katie looked back at Shannon. “Maybe that’s why you draw and paint so much—to try to save yourself from your own troubles.”

Shannon smiled and nodded again. “Maybe,” she said with a sigh. “But I don’t feel like it’s working. She wasn’t the only one to drown in those waters, you know.”

Katie looked at the painting again and then back at Shannon. “I know. Now come on, Shannon—what are you going to do? The  painting isn’t the only thing you need to save yourself from. You need to do it for your dad and your uncle too. You can’t keep drowning.”

Shannon kept quiet for a few moments before answering. “I will try,” she finally said as she looked once more at the painting in her hands.

Katie nodded at her cousin and reached over to turn off the light, leaving Shannon in darkness once more. She turned toward the door and slipped out into the night, the door creaking quietly behind her as she left Shannon alone in her despair.

Katie walked slowly through the familiar streets, her heart heavy with what she had seen in Shannon’s paintings. What would it take to save Shannon from herself? She thought to herself as she continued walking toward home. What could be worse than losing your mother? Perhaps only losing your husband, daughter or both, she thought. She tried to imagine how it would feel to lose both her mother and father in the same year. The thought was unbearable.

In the distance a figure walking toward her caught her attention. It was a man wearing a long dark coat and an old-fashioned bowler hat. An expression  of alarm crossed Katie’s face as she realized that this was the man that had approached her and Shannon on the boardwalk. She quickened her pace and turned down a side street, hoping to avoid him altogether. When she looked around again, however, he was right behind her. A chill went up Katie’s spine as he drew closer, and then his face came into view.

“Hello, Miss Matthews,” the man said with a smile.

The sound of her name coming from his mouth made her stomach lurch nervously, and she looked about wildly for some way to escape.

“We don’t have much time, so I must be brief. You have done well in following my instructions so far, but you still have much to learn,” the man said. “I will meet you tomorrow at the beach at exactly ten o’clock. You must ask me what you want to know, no matter how many times I tell you that it is not possible. Do you understand?”

Katie nodded her head slowly, afraid to speak. The man placed his hand on Katie’s shoulder and then disappeared into thin air. She couldn’t tell if he had vanished or if she had been tricked, but he was gone and she was left alone on the sidewalk.

“Katie?” Shannon called quietly from a few feet away. “Are you all right?” Katie turned to see Shannon standing in the empty lot across the street.

“I… I saw someone,” Katie said, looking nervously over her shoulder. “He looked like a photographer taking pictures of people on the boardwalk. He asked me if we knew who he was, and then he disappeared before I could explain. What was that?”

“I don’t know, but it felt like magic or something. Don’t worry about it for now. Do you want to see my new paintings?” Shannon led the way toward her house and they walked up the steps into Shannon’s attic apartment. When they got there, Shannon showed Katie the paintings that she had done while she was in Paris. To Katie’s amazement, each one was more incredible than the last and each one was different from the others. They were all inspired by her travels, but every single one contained a hidden message that  spoke about life and death.

“You are so talented!” Katie gushed as she examined each painting carefully.

“They are nothing compared to yours! Look at how you captured that moment! It is so real! The water is breaking right before my eyes, Shannon. You need to send it in!”

Shannon smiled proudly and then decided to show Katie her favorite piece. It was called “Mother’s Eyes,” and it was based on the photograph that she had drawn when she was in Paris. It showed a woman with bright blue eyes gazing out at the viewer with love and wonder.

“I like this one best because my mom is looking back at me. She told me once not to forget to see through her eyes. She said that if I did, then I would always be able to see her again whenever I wanted,” Shannon said as she stared at the painting with a sad smile.

“Shannon, this is beautiful. You have to keep painting. I think it is what your mom would want you to do,” Katie said as she put her hand on Shannon’s shoulder.

Shannon nodded and then took a deep breath. She knew that Katie was right. It was time to get back to work.",1
Gabriel moves out of his parents' house and into his own apartment.,"Gabriel’s parents helped him pack his bags. He was excited to leave his parent’s house, but he would miss his family. It all seemed like just yesterday that he had moved out of his old apartment, and now he was moving out again. He looked forward to living on his own, with no one looking over his shoulder telling him what to do. His parents were being helpful in the process, as they helped him pack up all of his things. It was a nice day for September, with a light breeze blowing through the open window in his bedroom. He still had some more stuff to pack in the basement, but he figured he would start by getting everything out of his room.

He opened the door to his room and immediately noticed that there were boxes scattered all over the carpet. He would have to get started right away, since he had a lot of packing ahead of him. His parents sat  on the couch and watched him as he went through each box, emptying it of various items. There were a lot of books, which he had no use for, so he proceeded to take them and put them in a box. He would think about donating them later on when he was done moving. Then he saw the boxes of school supplies that he had been carting around college for four years. They were dusty, but still usable, so he decided to keep them.

While Gabriel sorted through his belongings, his parents exchanged small talk with each other about how sad they were that their baby boy was moving out. They wondered  aloud why he felt the need to move into his own apartment, instead of living at home for a while longer. Gabriel simply explained that he didn’t want to be a burden to them anymore, and that it was time for him to grow up. His father replied that they would never consider him a burden.  To prove this point, his mother opened the refrigerator door and took out a box of cold cuts. She said that she could have made him a sandwich for lunch if he had wanted one, which made Gabriel laugh.

His parents went on to ask him how much they could help him with rent. He told them that he had already found a good deal on an apartment, and if they wanted to help out, they could buy some necessities for his house like a couch or a bed. They thanked him for letting them know about their financial options. Gabriel’s dad joked that if he kept his grades up, they might even allow him to buy a television, but Gabriel replied that it wouldn’t be necessary. He felt better knowing that they were so supportive of his decision to move out.

Once he had settled on where all the boxes would go, Gabriel began to get into the actual process of packing up his room. His",0
"John Doe, the serial killer, tells Valerie that she must escape the basement before dawn or else she will become his next trophy.","her to reach. Valerie turned around and started to walk back towards the door she had entered through.

As Valerie walked, she noticed that the musty smell that had been bothering her seemed to be getting stronger. She also noticed a faint noise coming from somewhere in the basement; it almost sounded like someone humming.  Valerie ignored the noises for a while until she realized that they might be another source of help. Perhaps the person behind the humming could help her escape from this basement, provided it was safe to reveal herself to him or her.

Valerie decided that she needed to see who was in the basement with her, even if it meant risking an encounter with John Doe. She would rather have an ally at her side than to be alone in this dark basement.

Valerie continued walking towards the humming sound, but as she tried to get closer, she stumbled over a piece of furniture and fell over. Valerie quickly got up and realized that she was standing right next to the source of the humming noise. It was a man who was sitting down on a wooden chair with his back facing towards her. He had shoulder-length black hair and was wearing a black t-shirt with an image of a skull on it and some blue jeans. Another thing Valerie noticed about the man was that he seemed to be wearing a pair of gloves, but the ends of his fingertips were cut off.

The man turned around and looked at Valerie. He then extended his hand to help her up and said, “Are you all right?” 

Valerie accepted the man’s hand and used it to stand back up. She then said, “Yes, I’m fine. I was just looking for someone in this basement and almost tripped over your chair.”

John Doe looked a little surprised by what Valerie said, but then responded by saying, “I’m sorry about that. My name is John Doe. Who are you?”

Valerie was relieved that the man could talk and didn’t seem to be bothered by it too much, so she said, “I’m Valerie Marx. I had a friend who used to live here, and I came back here a couple of days ago to visit him. I guess he didn’t tell me that he sold the house. He’s a real jerk sometimes.”

John Doe put his hands in his pockets and said, “I can understand how that can be frustrating. All right, it’s getting late and we should get some rest. We can talk more tomorrow if you’d like to, but for now, let’s go back into that other room and try to get some sleep.”

Valerie looked at John Doe in disbelief, but then asked, “Well, I suppose that would be logical. What’s your name?”

“For now, I’m just John Doe. But don’t worry, you’ll find out my name soon enough. Now let’s get going. You don’t want to attract any attention from the neighbors; they might call the police and I really don’t want to be arrested for trespassing.”

Valerie was taken aback by John Doe’s answer, but followed his lead and went back into the little room. She was exhausted, so she laid down upon the old mattress and quickly fell asleep.

When Valerie woke up, she found herself on the floor with her hands tied behind her back, still locked in the handcuffs. In desperation, she tried to kick and move about in order to free herself but it did no good. That’s when she realized that her feet were also tied together and that the carpet prevented her from moving about even if she was able to free her hands. 

“Hello, Valerie. I hope you slept well. Now let’s get going so you can avoid this place before your captor wakes up. I’d really like to keep our relationship friendly and so I’m giving you a head start before I come after you.  Please don’t try anything stupid, such as trying to run away with me in this basement because then my patience will run out and I don’t think you’d like the outcome. So please try to run away from this place before dawn, okay?”  John Doe spoke in a calm voice, but his words were laced with menace.

Valerie was unsure what to make of this situation. She couldn’t see anything and she didn’t even know how she got here. If John Doe could provide her with a head start, then maybe he could help her to escape the basement. So Valerie nodded slowly, not saying anything.

Without any further words from John Doe, she heard footsteps coming up behind her before she felt something soft and spongy being draped over her face. For a moment, Valerie blacked out, but when she regained consciousness and took a breath, she smelled an overwhelming smell of disinfectant.

“That smell…” Valerie thought to herself. “It smells like the medical supply room in the basement at my school. But… But I was just in my dorm room about an hour ago. I remember turning off the light and",0
Jenna Adams meets Brian Johnson and immediately feels drawn to him.,"Jenna Adams was a young woman who had decided that she would never get married. She had made this decision during her college years, and she steadfastly adhered to it. She was in her early twenties when she made this decision, and she was living on her own in the city of Nashville. She was a petite young woman, and she had dark hair. Her eyes were green, and they were shaped like almonds. She did not have a lot of money; she was a waitress at an outdoor café that sat near the Cumberland River. The people who ran this café were kind to her; they were like family. Her name was Jenna Adams, and one day she met Brian Johnson.

She had been sitting at the restaurant that morning when Brian walked in the door. He was thirty years old, but he looked much younger. He had a round face, and he wore his brown hair in messy waves. He had a mischievous smile on his face the moment she saw him, and he was decked out in sunglasses and a big straw hat. Jenna liked his hat; it reminded her of a sunflower. “Hello,” she said to him. “Good morning,” Brian replied in a husky voice. His voice was deep and sounded raspy, but it had a musical quality to it. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you around here before,” she said. “Yeah, I just moved into town yesterday,” Brian said as he  slid into the seat across from her. They ordered their coffees, and they began to talk.

Brian was originally from New Jersey; he had just moved to Tennessee to take a job as a copywriter at a marketing firm in Nashville. He told Jenna that his favorite kind of books to read were biographies  or autobiographies. “I like reading about the lives of successful people,” he said. Jenna smiled politely while he talked; she wasn’t much of a reader herself and didn’t really have much interest in what Brian had to say. “So, how did you end up moving to Tennessee?” she asked him. “I wanted to try something new,” he replied.

Jenna thought that it was interesting that they ended up sitting next to each other at the coffee shop; she wouldn’t have pegged them for being such a good match. But as they talked, she began to feel a strange sense of familiarity with him. They had so much in common; there was a spark of chemistry between them that Jenna couldn’t quite explain. For some reason, she felt more comfortable around Brian than anyone else she had ever met. She found herself hoping that he would ask her out so that they could get to know each other better.

After spending more time with Brian, Jenna began to develop genuine feelings for him. She began to want to spend more time with him and was eager to see whether their relationship could grow into something meaningful. It wasn’t long before Jenna realized that she had fallen in love with Brian.

But Brian was acting strangely towards her; he wasn’t as affectionate and flirty as he had been when they first met. The more time passed, the harder it became to get him to open up about his feelings for her. Jenna was confused;  she figured it was just nerves about taking their relationship to the next level, but she was worried that Brian might have met someone else.

Jenna knew that Brian had a mother and decided to pay her a visit. Mary Smith wasn’t particularly fond of Jenna, but she agreed to hear what Jenna had to say about her relationship with Brian. She was surprised that Jenna had the courage to face off against her, but she decided to be as honest as she could so that Jenna could make an informed decision about her future with Brian.

Jenna started by apologizing for the way they had acted when they first met; she explained that she was shy and lacked self-confidence. Mary was impressed with Jenna’s honesty, but she still didn’t think that Jenna deserved to be dating her son. She told Jenna that she wasn’t a good influence on her son and that she was too immature to have a relationship with him, but Jenna told her that Brian was the best thing that had ever happened to her and she wanted them to stay together.

Mary was surprised by Jenna’s strength of will and decided to give up trying to get the couple apart. If Brian wanted to be with Jenna, then there was nothing she could do to stop him from following his heart. The woman offered the young woman some advice for dealing with her son, so that they could have a better relationship in the future.

Jenna thanked Mary for listening to her, but she felt frustrated by how judgmental her son’s mother had been. She wasn’t used to her honesty being met with such hostility, and she didn’t know how to respond. She was also upset because she had expected Mary Smith to be proud of her son for loving someone like her, but instead the woman had accused her of bringing out the worst in him. 

Mary apologized for treating Jenna so cruelly and told her that she was worried about her son’s future. She explained that Brian was kind of an old soul who took a long time to trust people. She thought their relationship would be good for Brian and help him grow up a little bit, but she wasn’t sure what Jenna Adams was getting out of the relationship. She didn’t want her son to be hurt in the end, and that was why she had been so critical.

Jenna admitted that she was still getting used to being in a relationship, but she said it was the best thing that had ever happened to her. She told Mary that the fact that Brian Johnson trusted her was one of the greatest compliments she could ever receive. She wanted to prove to Mary and everyone else that she wasn’t dating him for money and nothing could convince her otherwise.

Mary told Jenna that she didn’t trust her. She wasn’t sure if she was good enough for her son, and she said that Jenna Adams was a threat to their relationship. She hoped that Brian would realize how much of a mistake he had made before it was too late, and Jenna Adams put her hands on her hips and demanded an explanation. Mary told her that she needed to leave her family alone and never come back, but Jenna asked if that would be the end of their relationship. Mary said that it was the only way they could be together.",0
Jenna Adams starts to think that maybe marriage isn't so bad after all when Brian Johnson seems like the perfect man for her.,"Jenna Adams thought about what she wanted, and she realized that there was nothing in the world that could tear her away from Brian Johnson. She knew that he was in love with her too, but he hadn’t said anything yet. He still called her his girlfriend and not his fiancée, and she couldn’t understand why he hadn’t asked her to marry him yet. She would have said yes right away because she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him, and she hoped that he felt the same way.

They drove up to Jenna Adams’ house in silence, and she told him to wait while she went inside. He stayed in his car while Jenna went inside her house, and he waited for her to come back out again. He watched as she closed the door behind her and walked over to the window. He saw that she was standing at the window, crying, and he knew that he couldn’t say anything to comfort her.

Jenna Adams couldn’t believe what she was feeling. She was sure that she had never felt this way about anyone before, and she was surprised by how much Brian Johnson meant to her. Her parents had always had a strong marriage, and she thought that that’s what she wanted in the future as well. Now, however, she wasn’t so sure that marriage was such a bad thing after all.

She stood by the window and stared out at the night sky as Brian Johnson stood by his car and watched her. She thought about how amazing it would be to spend every day with him, and she knew that she would do anything to keep their relationship going.

When Jenna Adams finally turned around, Brian Johnson walked over to her and took hold of her hand. He didn’t say anything, but she knew that he was willing to wait for her, and he wouldn’t leave until she had made up her mind.

Jenna Adams looked at Brian Johnson, and tears started to fill her eyes once again. She took a deep breath and wiped the tears from her face, and then she turned around and wrapped her arms around him. She felt his arms wrap around her back, and he squeezed her tightly as she buried her head in his chest, overcome by emotion.

“I want to be with you,” Jenna Adams whispered. “I want to be with you forever. I can’t imagine a life  without you in it.”

Brian Johnson held her tighter, and then he pulled away slightly so she could look him in the eyes. Jenna Adams thought he was going to tell her that he wanted her to marry him, but instead he simply nodded. She put her hands on his face and reached up to kiss his lips.

After a few minutes, Brian Johnson turned her around so she was facing the door again. He walked over to the driver’s side of the car and opened the door, then held his hand out for Jenna Adams.  She took his hand and stepped out of the car.

Jenna Adams followed Brian Johnson into her house, but she didn’t go up to her room like he expected. Instead, she walked down the hall toward the kitchen. She opened the refrigerator and rummaged around inside for a few minutes until she found what she was looking for. She pulled it out and then looked over at Brian Johnson to make sure he was watching.

“I’m going to marry you,” Jenna Adams declared.

Brian Johnson stood there, shocked. He couldn’t believe that Jenna Adams was actually going to marry him. After everything they had been through, it seemed like she had finally seen the real Brian Johnson. He could tell from the look in her eyes that she loved him as much as he loved her, and he knew that marrying her was the right thing to do.

He rushed over to her and threw his arms around her. She wrapped her arms around his neck as their lips met in a passionate kiss. She tasted so good, he couldn’t get enough of it. They kissed for several minutes before they pulled away from each other and looked into each other’s eyes.

Jenna Adams started to walk down the hallway toward her room, but Brian Johnson stopped her with a hand on the small of her back. “Let’s take this upstairs,” he suggested.

Jenna Adams laughed and said, “You’re so forward!”

He told her not to tell him what he can or can’t do. He pulled her up and into his arms, then headed up the stairs toward Jenna Adams’ bedroom. They didn’t say anything else as they walked up the stairs hand in hand. They entered Jenna Adams’ bedroom and sat down on the bed together. She turned to face him, but he leaned forward and kissed her, this time more passionately than before. Their lips met again and their tongues touched as they kissed passionately for several minutes. Brian Johnson moved his hands from Jenna Adams’ back to her hair and pulled her closer, deepening the kiss.

Jenna Adams relaxed in his arms. Her body felt so warm next to him and the feeling was incredible. After several minutes of kissing, Jenna Adams pulled back and looked at him with a smile on her face. “I want  to be with you forever,” he said.

“You can be,” Jenna Adams replied. “Let’s get married.”

Brian Johnson looked surprised and asked her if she was serious. “Of course I am,” she said. Brian Johnson",1
Shannon and Brad Barton's marriage is on the rocks due to Brad's infidelity.,"Brad Barton stared at the message on his cell phone, his face twisted in a sour grimace. He was sitting in Shannon Barton’s bedroom, an empty bottle of whiskey on the bedstand beside him. He knew that Shannon would be home any minute. The messages were still piling up on her answering machine. He had been avoiding her phone calls, and hadn’t even spoken to his children in over a week.

Brad Barton couldn’t stay away from Karen Spooner any longer. He wanted her more than he had ever wanted Shannon, and this time, he wasn’t going to let her get away.

The door opened and Shannon walked in. She looked at the bottle of whiskey sitting on her bedside table and immediately knew what was going on. Brad smiled reassuringly at Shannon, but his eyes were full of guilt and shame as he slowly lifted his gaze to meet hers. She didn’t say a word. Brad stood up and walked over to Shannon. He grabbed her by the shoulders and held her tightly. He smelled like liquor.

“Shannon, I’m so sorry,” he spoke quietly, unable to look Shannon in the eyes.  She stared back at him, not saying a word. Brad kissed Shannon on the lips for what seemed like an eternity. As he pulled away and looked her in the eyes, she could see tears in his own eyes as they began to fall. He was crying. “Shannon, I’m so sorry for hurting you. I’ve never felt this way about anybody before. Not even you, Shannon, not even you. Please forgive me. I can’t live without you as my wife, but if that’s how it has to be, then…then so be it. But please forgive  me.”

Shannon didn’t say a word. Instead she forced a huge smile on her face and stood up. She took Brad’s hands in hers and brought them to her heart. “I forgive you, Brad,” she said with a broken voice. 

Brad kissed her again, this time the kiss seemed much longer than the last. They stood there for what seemed like forever locked in each other’s arms, until finally Brad pulled away and sat back down on the couch, pulling Shannon down next to him.

“I love you so much, Shannon. You can never know how sorry I am for hurting you.”

Shannon was shocked at how quickly she had forgiven Brad for the pain he had caused her. She couldn’t even begin to understand why she did it, but right then she didn’t care. All that mattered was that Brad needed her forgiveness and he had gotten it. She could see the look of relief on his face as he started to tell her how much he loved her.

“Thank you, sweetheart. You have no idea how much better I feel now  that you’ve forgiven me…”

Just as Brad was about to tell Shannon how much he had missed her while she was gone, the front door suddenly swung open and a loud voice boomed around the room.

“Shannon, are you home? It’s me,  Dad! Where is Brad?”

Shannon quickly pulled herself out of Brad’s arms and stood up, trying to take comfort in the fact that she still didn’t love Rick like her own son. Brad stood up as well and went over to the front door to greet his father. Shannon watched him shake hands and hug for several seconds before he turned to walk back toward her. The expression on his face was one of complete shock and amazement which quickly faded into a smile as he approached her.

“Dad, this is Brad. He’s my husband. I hope you don",1
Daisy Mayberry receives a diagnosis of cancer and her family and friends come together to support her.,"One day, Daisy Mayberry went for an extra ride on her horse, Lady Bug. The next afternoon, she went to the doctor and was diagnosed with cancer.

The doctor explained, “I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but your MRI shows a malignant tumor on your brain. I would recommend that you see an oncologist immediately for further treatment options. Your prognosis is not good, but I am certain your family would like to be with you during this trying time.”

Daisy Mayberry’s breath caught when she heard the terrifying diagnosis. She immediately thought of her beautiful daughter Elizabeth, who was currently in graduate school. Daisy’s thoughts also went to her wonderful son, Bill, who was a Marine Corp officer stationed at Camp Pendleton in California with his wife and kids. But Daisy knew that her two children would stay by her side no matter what. 

After the doctor left the room, Daisy turned to her husband Bill Simpson as if she were a child saying goodbye to Santa Claus at the mall. Bill Simpson was by Daisy’s bedside this afternoon, and he squeezed her thin hand gently.

“Daisy, I don’t know what to say. I can’t believe this is happening,” Bill said softly as he stared into his wife’s eyes.

Elizabeth Simpson immediately flew from Denver, Colorado to be at her mother and father’s side. She could not imagine having her own mother taken away from her at such a young age. When Elizabeth arrived, she immediately hugged her parents tightly and began crying on their shoulders.

Daisy and Bill both knew that the end was near, but they did not want to show their tearful daughter how afraid they were. Instead, Bill offered Elizabeth the guest bedroom upstairs while he took Daisy to their bed.

“Mama, I know it’s hard for you to say this right now, so you don’t have to if you don’t want to,” Elizabeth said softly as she held Daisy’s hand. “But I really need to know. How much time do I have left with you? Is there any possibility that you will recover?”

Daisy felt a tear roll down her cheek as she looked into her daughter’s eyes. She knew this was the hardest question she would have to answer, but she also knew this was what Elizabeth needed to hear in order to be able to cope with their situation.

“I am so sorry to have to tell you this,” Daisy said as she sobbed on her daughter’s shoulder. “But I know what is coming and I don’t want to be the reason that you are not prepared when the time comes. Can you promise me that you will do exactly what I ask?”

Elizabeth nodded as she wiped away her mother’s tears. “I promise, Mama. Do what you need to do and I will go along with it.”

With a trembling voice, Daisy said, “I am so sorry to say this but there is no possibility that I will recover. This disease has progressed too far for me to beat it now.”

Elizabeth grabbed her mother’s other hand and said,  “Then let’s face it together. You have done a great job of raising me and I am strong enough to get through this. I love you so much, Mother — please don’t leave me alone.”

Daisy hugged Elizabeth tightly while she sobbed harder than she had ever done in her entire life. She was sure that she would not survive this ordeal. Instead, Daisy decided to concentrate on being with her family during what remained of their time together.

That evening, Bill took over the operation of the hardware store while Elizabeth and her father went to stay with Daisy at the hospital. The support of her family gave Daisy strength in fighting the disease, but there was only a small chance of her recovery.

The following morning, Elizabeth called Alice Chambers to tell her about the situation. Alice and Wayne had two children of their own and they were devastated at hearing about Daisy’s illness. Alice said that she would get in touch with all of Daisy’s friends to let them know what had happened. The townspeople needed to know so that they could pray for her recovery.

In the days that followed, all of the townspeople in Maple Valley came to visit Daisy at the hospital. Bill would drive over to the hospital as many times as possible to help fill Daisy’s room with well-wishers. The visitors and prayers from her family and community helped provide Daisy with the strength she needed to continue fighting.

One evening, Bill came home from the hospital and asked Elizabeth if she would be willing to drive down to Seattle to visit one of Daisy’s oldest friends, Tanya Swanson.

Tanya was the librarian at the Maple Valley Community Library. She had been a friend of Daisy’s since they were children. It was Tanya who had suggested that Daisy should be nominated for the position as President of the Library Board of Trustees. In fact, this was how Daisy had met Bill. Although Bill and Tanya had not seen each other in a while, it was obvious that they still loved each other deeply.

Elizabeth drove to Seattle and went directly to the hospital where Tanya Swanson was being treated for leukemia. Daisy had told Elizabeth that she wanted her to explain what was happening with her to Tanya so that Tanya could pray for her. Tanya was in bad shape, but made it clear that she needed to talk with Elizabeth. 

Elizabeth explained to Tanya that Daisy was battling cancer and that she only had a few weeks left to live. She asked if Tanya would pray for her. Daisy had specifically asked Tanya to tell Elizabeth certain things that Daisy felt were important so that Elizabeth could tell Bill what was going on.

Tanya was emotional after Elizabeth told her the news about Daisy. She went into a room where she could be alone and, from there, she called Bill Simpson. They talked about the situation with Daisy for a while and then, together, they prayed for Daisy’s soul.

The following day, Bill went to visit his wife at the hospital. Elizabeth had gone back to her house and Bill was alone with Daisy. She told him the things that she wanted him to know.

That afternoon, Bill took over the operation of Daisy’s hardware store. His daughter, Lisa, stayed at the hospital to be with Daisy. The two women were all alone in the small room that Daisy was staying in.

Daisy was hooked up to a breathing apparatus and she was connected to her IVs. Lisa brought Daisy some clothes and then she prepared her for bed time. She changed the sheets on the bed and then she helped Daisy remove her clothing.

She held Daisy’s hand as they both cried. Lisa had never seen her mother cry like this before. Daisy told Lisa that she was very scared to die alone, and that she worried about Bill and Lisa being sad. She said that it was so unfair that she had to leave them.

Lisa’s heart hurt for her mother. Her mom looked so scared and frail lying in the bed. She stroked her mom’s hair and spoke softly to her. Daisy felt so safe when Lisa was holding her hand. It was as if she was being held by a child, the way she needed to be held at this time.

She closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep in Lisa’s arms. She had a dreamless sleep that night and did not awaken until the morning. As soon as Daisy woke up, she wanted to get out of bed and take a shower. She had a feeling that she wasn’t going to feel pretty for much longer and she wanted to feel as attractive as possible while she still could.

Lisa helped Daisy out of bed and they went into the bathroom where Lisa helped her into the shower chair. They turned",1
Daisy ultimately beats cancer and her story inspires hope in her community.,"?” Lisa was really crying now, and Daisy was comforted by her daughter’s tears.

“That will never happen,” she said. “I have faith in the doctors and my own determination not to give up. I know that God won’t let me down. He must have a plan for me. And besides, I’ll still be here with you, and we could get through this together.”

“I know you’re right,” responded Lisa slowly drying her eyes. “Now if you can just get the rest of the town to believe it, everything will be fine.”

Daisy laughed lightly. She then continued, “My friends and neighbors are doing their best to be supportive. But they all seem to have a hard time believing it too. I just wish they would…”

Lisa interrupted her. “What if they had seen what you’ve seen? Your treatments were so painful and debilitating at times that I would literally have to pull you through the house on your stomach so that you wouldn’t fall down. One of the worst days was when they made you stand up after you’d been lying flat on your back all day. I had to hold onto your arms and pull you to your feet. I thought we were going to have a nervous breakdown right there in the hospital room.”

“I remember,” replied Daisy quietly smiling. “But those days are over now, and the only thing that really worries me is whether I’ll be able to work here at the store when my treatments are over with. They’re so complicated and exacting that I just don’t know. But as long as I can take care of my own…”

Daisy paused for a moment. Then she lifted her head and gazed straight at Lisa. “Thank you for being here for me, baby; I couldn’t have made it without you. And it means so much to me that you believe I’ll come back from this. I don’t know how well you know Evelyn Chambers, but she’s the only other person that I can think of who would have such faith in me. She’s got a lot more of it than you do. You should talk to her sometime. She knows I ’ll come back, too.”

Lisa said nothing.

Her mother had become very quiet again, and she stood up slowly, took a few steps across the room, and sat down on the long couch. She picked up the remote control lying next to her glass of iced tea, clicked it on, and watched the TV screen.

Lisa sat down beside her mother. She reached out and took Daisy’s hand. The younger woman was surprised at how hot it felt in her own. As they watched the TV, she said, “Mom, I’m worried about what will happen if you don’t come back. I will be all alone.”

Daisy looked over at her gently and squeezed Lisa’s hand. “I know, baby—it’s so hard on you to have me so sick like this. But I’ll be home on Saturday. You will see.”

Lisa moved her mouth and made noises, but no sound came out of her throat. She couldn’t say anything, not even the things she had been rehearsing in her mind for days on end, but now that she was here, right next to her, she could not make them come out.

She moved her hand from Daisy’s and put it on her own face, feeling the coldness of the skin through the thin cotton of her T-shirt. Her eyes were red; she could just make them out in the dim light. She moved her hand slowly down to the side of her neck, and then she touched the long scar that ran from her collarbone to below her ear. She did not move it away right away, but just traced over its length gently with her fingers.

She moved her hand away to look at it, and then moved her head slightly one way and then the other so she could see it from the left and then from the right.

“It’s so big, honey—it looks like a snake bite. They said the scar would go away in a few months, but it has been a year now, and it looks the same. I think they must have been wrong and that it will always look like that.” She moved her head back to look at her mother and smiled. “But you know what’s weird? I don’t even notice it anymore. It just blends in with everything  else on my body.”

Her mother smiled at her, and then she took Daisy’s hand again. Her skin felt soft and warm, like a rose petal. Daisy closed her eyes for a second and felt the heat rising through her body.

“You know,” she continued, “I was so scared at first. But here I am a year later—cancer free—and that fear has completely disappeared. There are no more shadows on the horizon now that I have beaten the thing that was trying to kill me. And it wouldn’t be possible without all of you.”

She moved her head around in a circle, and everyone in the Mayberry community who had prayed for her or helped in any way stood up from where they were seated and cheered. She stood as well, and the group circled around her with smiles on their faces. Some of them brought their hands together in prayer, while others moved to give Daisy a hug or shake her hand.

“Thank you all so much,” she said when the parade had finally ended and everyone had returned to their seats. “You really don’t know how much this means to me. I am so amazed by all of the support I have gotten from Mayberry.

The townspeople and the people here in this square have helped me in ways that I never thought were possible, and for that I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. And for those of you who haven’t had the chance yet, there is still time to join Mayberry in their fight against cancer. You can join us on May 12th at 11 AM at Mayberry Square as we host Walk-a-Thon, which is a fundraiser for local cancer patients. We will have t-shirts and balloons available for purchase, so be sure to come down and support Mayberry.

The next few days were filled with visitors coming to see Daisy in the Mayberry Square. People came from miles away just to shake her hand and tell her how much they admired her. She happily talked with everyone, and gave each person words of encouragement as she had been doing for the last few days.

Mayberry Square was not the only place that was filled with visitors who had come to see Daisy; her home was also filled with visitors every day. Among the guests were many of those who had prayed for her during her  battle with cancer and were relieved to see that their prayers had been answered. While some of the visitors were there to pay their respects, others came out of curiosity and just wanted to catch a glimpse of Daisy in person.

Daisy Mayberry was truly a hero, an inspiration to millions of people who watched her story with cancer unfold. Her story had become known worldwide, thanks to the internet and television. While she was not the only one in her community who had been stricken with cancer, she was definitely the most popular of them all.

A few years past after Daisy had beaten cancer and things were going as usual. She was happy to be alive, and very proud of herself for beating the disease. She had many ideas about how to help others with their problems, and decided that it was time to put those ideas into action.

The first thing she did was open up her own web site so that people from across the country and around the world could get in touch with her. She often received letters from cancer patients who were seeking advice about how to survive a cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment.

She then established a non profit organization with the goal of providing aid to those in need. At first, the organization was called “Daisy’s Daisy Foundation”, in memory of her deceased pet dog. Over time, the name was changed to “The Mayberry Community Outreach”.

The non profit organization offered a broad range of services. The help that she offered ranged from financial assistance, to emotional counseling, to spiritual guidance. She also taught classes about how to cope with the stress of having cancer and provided educational materials about how to prevent the disease.

Over time, people from all over the world started looking up to her as an inspiration, especially those who had been diagnosed with cancer. As a result of her story they never lost hope and were determined to overcome their illness.

Even though she was not a medical professional by any stretch of the imagination, she was happy to share her own experiences and provide support in whatever way she could. She knew from personal experience how tough it was to deal with cancer on your own. She knew what it was like to lose all hope and become depressed when the fight against cancer seemed hopeless. And she knew that there were not enough resources in her community to help those who needed it.

She also knew firsthand how hard it was for family members to care for a loved one who is going through a long, debilitating illness. She was determined to do whatever she could to ease the burden for those who were struggling.

Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,"authors and musicians.

Aimee’s eyes lit up at being able to talk about books and movies with someone else who loved them as much as she did, but Kyle was having a hard time getting into it. He wanted to be listening and watching a movie at the same time, and he was finding it hard to do both at the same time.

Kyle Johnson took out a packet of candy from his jacket pocket and offered Aimee some. They sat in silence for a few moments while munching on their treats, each lost in their own thoughts. Aimee finally spoke. “I struggle with connecting to people,” she said. “There’s a lot of things I want to share about myself, but I don’t know who I can talk to about them. And sometimes I worry that no one will understand what I have to say.” 

Kyle was silent for a moment. “I know how that feels,” he said softly.

“It must be really difficult being in advertising,” Aimee said. “You have to deal with a lot of people all the time, and if you can’t connect with them… I just couldn’t do that. I would be terrible at it.”

“Like you said, it is a struggle,” Kyle said slowly. “And sometimes I wonder if it’s worth it. But then I feel selfish for  feeling that way because I do enjoy the job.” He paused and looked at Aimee, who was studying the TV intently. “But as you said, when it comes to life in general, I have a hard time connecting with people.”

Aimee glanced up at Kyle. She felt grateful to him for listening and not interrupting her. “I don’t mean this in a bad way, Kyle, but you seem like the kind of guy who doesn’t care about what people think of him. You never seem to  worry about what other people are thinking of you.”

Kyle nodded slowly. “I suppose that’s true, but I can sense when I’m being judged by other people, even if it’s not obvious. And it makes me feel alone in the world. It drives me nuts and sometimes I feel like I want to run away.”

Aimee felt a pang in her chest. She had never shared this feeling with anyone before, and she was startled to hear Kyle admit he felt the same way. Kyle seemed so calm and confident when he talked about his feelings. He really understood what Aimee was saying, which made her feel even more isolated from the world than before. She was still clutching her old teddy bear in her hands. “Sometimes I wish I could be like you, Kyle. Sometimes I feel like I’m stuck inside my own head and the world is a big scary place and I just want to hide under my bed or something. Sometimes I feel like when I’m alone, that no one really cares about me and it makes me sad.”",1
Daisy Mayberry receives a diagnosis of cancer and her family and friends come together to support her.,"In Mayberry, a town on the outskirts of nowhere, the news of Daisy Mayberry’s illness spread quickly. It didn’t take long for everyone to hear that her cancer had returned. Soon as word got out, people came out of the woodwork to help and pray for her.
	Her husband Charles Grayson, Daisy’s closest friend Tanya Swanson and even the little old ladies down at Mayberry’s Café were concerned about her. Her illness would bring them all together in a way they had never been before.
	Daisy Mayberry was a kindhearted, loving woman in her early 50’s who everyone loved. She was the wife of Charles Grayson and the mother of two children: daughter Lisa Marie and son Joe. She was also the grandmother to six little girls and one boy who all lived across the country with their mothers or fathers.
	She was diagnosed with breast cancer just eight years ago when her youngest grandchild was only three. She had beaten it then, but sadly, it had returned. This time the doctors told her that there was little they could do for her. They said that she may have a couple of months left to live. Daisy’s family and friends were devastated. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer again and they all knew that she probably would not see Christmas.
	They came together to help and support her as much as they could. Her husband, Charles, was at her side helping her get through the pain of it all. Her daughter Lisa Marie was also at her side helping take care of her mother throughout the day, as well as taking care of her children who were in school.
	Daisy’s son Joe worked from home taking business calls during the day and helping his father tend to his mother at night when Charles would get home from work.
	Her friends Tanya Swanson and Andrea Grayson were also there for her every day, helping them however they could with food and other things around the house. Everyone came over once a week to sit with Daisy and hold her hand, or make sure that she was getting enough rest. They would go in shifts so that everyone had a chance to visit with Daisy without worrying about whether it was their turn or not. They sat by her bedside and tried as best they could to comfort her when she would cry for hours on end. She would scream out in pain from the cancer eating away at her bones, making it impossible for her to move without being in agony. But she knew that her family loved her and that they were there with her, and that made it easier to bear the pain.
	They were all there for her, holding on to hope that a miracle would happen and that she would beat this cancer once again.
	They had been through this before and no one knew what to expect, even though they had all lost faith that anything would happen. They were all scared, but more than anything else they wanted her to get better soon.
	The day came when she started complaining about not feeling well, and then the pain started coming back in a big way. Everyone thought that her time was finally here, but they stayed with her all night as she got worse and worse. Finally it was the middle of the next day and no one had heard anything from Daisy since the night before, and they started to worry about what was going on with her.
	Then a few minutes later there was a knock at the door, and everyone jumped up at once. There were tears of joy on their faces as they ran into the room to see her standing there looking very healthy and well rested. They were all crying tears of joy at having been reunited with Daisy again, but no one was happier than Charles because it meant that they would all be able to keep on caring for Daisy and hope for another miracle.
	They all hugged her and told her how happy they were to see her doing so well, and then they got back into bed with her so that she could tell them how it all came about.
	“I saw this old friend of mine named Dr. Davis,” said Daisy Mayberry. “He looked me up on the internet and called me in for an examination right away. I went to see him because I had a feeling that something was wrong, so I decided that he would be the one to find out what it was. He did some tests and asked me a bunch of questions, then he told me that there is something else wrong with me, but it’s not my cancer. It’s something much worse! You all better get ready for what I have to tell you now because it might just make you cry!”
	They all sat down in the chairs lining the sides of her bed again, and they prepared themselves for whatever news they were about to hear next.
	“I have Stage 4 heart failure and I need a heart transplant right away because there is nothing that medicine can do to help me,” Daisy Mayberry said. “The cancer is killing me, but the heart failure is going to kill me faster if it’s not treated. We are still praying for a miracle, but we will start looking into treatments that might help the cancer even though there is no hope and no cure for it. Dr. Davis says that I don’t have long to live, so I probably won’t be around much longer to see my grandson go on his mission or to send my daughter off to college next year. I feel so bad that I won’t be around to see all the wonderful things that are going to happen in our lives, but at least my grandbaby will be able to go on his mission if he decides that he wants to serve a mission someday. I can’t wait to see him do it! He is going to make a wonderful missionary, and I wish so bad that I could be there with him too.”
	All of this was devastating news for everyone in her family, but they wouldn’t think about that right now. They just wanted to concentrate on getting her healthy again. She was their number one priority and they were all going to do everything",1
A group of survivors find themselves holed up in an old house in the middle of nowhere.,"Jennifer Lopez awoke in the middle of the night to get water. Everyone was sleeping, so she tried to be as quiet as possible. When she went outside she found herself in a strange world of empty houses and lonely streets. She walked down the street, hoping to find some other survivors, but saw no one. She decided to go back inside and went into a house. She opened the fridge and found it was completely empty, except for a bottle of wine. She took the bottle out and looked at it for a while, trying to decide if she should drink or not. Finally she decided that she had nothing left to live for, so she opened the bottle and downed a glass of wine.

    After she had finished her wine, Jennifer went upstairs to lie down on one of the beds in the bedroom. She wondered what had happened to human race and why they were all dead. She lay in bed for a while before falling asleep.

    When she woke up again, it was morning, and everyone else had woken up and gone downstairs to the living room. Jennifer walked into the living room and found that everyone was sitting around drinking coffee. They all turned to look at her when she walked in, and one of them said “There you are.”

    Everyone looked around, but there was no one there anymore. There was only silence and emptiness.

    All of a sudden, a group of people walked in through the door. They were armed with guns and were wearing army uniforms. The soldiers came into the room and yelled “Everyone get down on the ground!”

    Everyone got down on the ground and held their hands up over their heads as the soldiers searched them for weapons. One of the soldiers looked at Jennifer and said “Are there any survivors?”

    Jennifer said no, and the soldier walked over to her. He pointed his gun at her head and said “You better not be lying or we’ll shoot you right now!”

    Jennifer started crying, and the soldier said “We’re not going to hurt you! We need survivors to help us rebuild society! Tell us where other survivors are!”

    Jennifer looked up at him with fear in her eyes, but said nothing.

    The soldier grabbed her by the arm and dragged her out of the house, pulling along all the other survivors who were hiding in closets or under beds.

    One survivor who was hiding under a bed came up to Jennifer as they were taking her outside. The survivor looked terrified and said “What’s happening? Where are we going?”

    Jennifer asked the same question, but no one answered. She was dragged out into the darkness of an overcast night. She could just barely see in front of her and heard the other survivors screaming for help as she was taken outside by another soldier.

    As she was being taken out of the house, she noticed that even though it was dark, there were still lights shining on in the houses around her. Her captor said “We’ve found them! They’re all hiding! Now we just have to find out where they are hiding.”

    Jennifer screamed and begged him not to take her away, but it no avail. She was forced into an old abandoned car with four other survivors who were screaming for help as she felt herself being violently jerked around and tossed into the backseat of a small car. She could barely see out the windows because it was so dark outside, and everyone was yelling over each other. They were all screaming for help as the car lurched forward into the darkness of night.

    They were all thrown around inside the cramped quarters and when they came to a stop, Jennifer realized that they were in an old abandoned house. The door flew open and a large group of soldiers rushed out of the house with guns drawn. They had found them in the car and one screamed out “We’ve got them! We’ve got them, sir!”

    The soldier with the gun entered the house and everyone still in the car realized that they were going to be shot. Jennifer screamed for help but it was too late; they were all surrounded by soldiers with guns drawn and there was nothing they could do about it.

    One of the soldiers shouted “You have five minutes to explain everything before we shoot you! Now tell us everything you know!” Jennifer and the other survivors looked at each other, still not grasping what was going on. In a panic, one survivor shouted “I don’t know what you want to know! I don’t even know what’s going on! We just got here five minutes ago and we were hiding under a bed in the house, and-”

    “Shut up! Just shut up for once in your god damned lives! Do you really think we’re all idiots? They find you in an abandoned house and you’ve got nothing to say? You’re all guilty of something, either being part of some terrorist group or something else that I don’t even know about. Tell me everything you know!”

    “What do you want to know? We haven’t done anything wrong. We just want to live our lives and be left alone-” Jennifer pleaded.

    “You think this is a game? Do you think this is funny? Do you think all of these people died because they were meant to die? All those innocent people died, all those families with children who had no idea what was going on when they were blown up or shot by your own kind. You think it’s funny that so many people died trying to defend their country and their families and friends while cowards like you hid in houses until you thought it would be safe to go out again. Well, it’s not going to be safe for you any more! We",0
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"friends, and she had stopped taking part in the activities she used to enjoy doing in her spare time. Shannon was spending more time alone at home because her father didn’t seem interested in doing anything with her, and so it seemed as though she had no one else to turn to but herself. “She’s trying to cope with her loss, and I don’t think she’s learned to do that yet,” Uncle Jeff said.

Shannon was sitting on the edge of her bed, holding a box of oil paints that was given to her by her mother before she passed away from cancer. She started crying uncontrollably once again upon seeing both her uncle and father approach her room slowly. “What are you doing here?” Shannon asked, wiping the tears from her face and standing up. There were paint stains on her cheeks, nose and hands. Her uncle could see that she had been crying for a while.

“I came to talk to you,” her father said.

“About what?” Shannon asked, turning away from them. She started pacing around the room as she spoke. “You don’t care how I feel, so why should I tell you?” she asked.

Her father stepped inside the room and placed a hand on her shoulder. “I do care about how you feel daughter,” he said softly. Her uncle noticed that there were small tears forming in her father’s eyes.

“Yeah, right. If you did care, you wouldn’t have left us all behind to deal with this grief on our own,” she said, turning to face her father directly now. She looked in his eyes and saw that he had started crying now. “He doesn’t care.” She turned to face her uncle now. “You don’t care either, do you?”

Her uncle sighed and shook his head slowly. He did care, but he knew that she wouldn’t believe him just yet. “No, I do care Shannon,” he said gently.

She looked at him for a few moments while the tears continued to fall from her father’s eyes and then nodded and walked over to sit on her bed. The two men stood nearby, unsure of what to do next. Her father was crying now,  so he didn’t know how to handle this situation.

Shannon saw the box of oil paints on her nightstand. She picked it up and opened it slowly, letting the tears continue to stream down her face as she did so. She stared at the empty canvas in front of her for a few moments before she took out a large brush and dipped it into a small jar of red paint. Then, Shannon started to paint.

She started painting out of her own grief and loneliness, but as she worked, she found that somehow painting helped to ease it. She painted for hours and didn’t eat anything. Shannon’s need to paint became so strong that she decided to clear out her attic and turn it into a studio, so that she could paint there whenever she felt like it.

She turned her old wooden desk into a workbench and filled the walls with canvases, paints, brushes, and other painting materials. Shannon moved her easel to the center of the room and placed two chairs in front of it. She hung some potted plants in the corners of the room for decoration purposes. The attic was small, but she didn’t mind that. It was just right for her. It also reminded  her of the attic in the family’s old barn.

Shannon would spend hours in the studio, painting and listening to music on her headphones. She discovered that drawing people helped her to feel connected with her mother once more, and so she would draw portraits of her mother over and over again. The  act of drawing also helped Shannon to cope with her feelings.

Shannon started to put her own feelings into the paintings, too. She could often be found staring at one of her own unfinished paintings, which had two figures standing in a meadow. The figures were very dark and pale, reflecting Shannon’s feelings of being filled with darkness but also feeling a glimmer of light at the same time.

This painting became an outlet for Shannon and she would often sit and stare at it for long periods of time to try to work some of her pain and confusion out on it. Sometimes, she would cover the painted surface with salt and trace the outlines of her paintings in a faint blue wash. This felt like she was connecting with someone, especially since her own mother could no longer speak to her. Shannon felt as if she were having a conversation with her mother by painting the images over and over again. Shannon started to feel closer to her paintings and knew that they helped her to heal.

Shannon painted for hours every day, with only a short break for lunch which she always ate while standing up. She drank a lot of water so that she wouldn’t feel weak or tired. She felt almost as peaceful as when she was painting and felt that it was her therapy. Shannon painted every night until she finished a painting, and then she would start a new one. Sometimes, she would paint for six hours straight without stopping, and this helped to ease the pain in her heart. Sometimes, while painting, Shannon felt like",1
The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"’s. She is a GP too and she always needs the business!”
	The man laughed, “You know I think I will do that! So thank you again for saving me from having an awful scar on my arm for the rest of my life!”
	And with that, he left the exam room and went on his way.
	Andrea came in to see how things were going and found Lisa sitting at her desk, trying to sort through the paperwork that she had started gathering as her mother began dictating the details of each patient’s visit.
	She asked, “So how did everything go?”
	Lisa replied, still sorting through the receipts and files, “It went pretty well. There was one patient who wanted a prescription for some pain medication but I refused to give it to him because I thought that he just wanted some pills for recreational use. Oh, and I changed our appointment book so that you have some free time tomorrow and the rest of the week. So yay! No more working late!”
	Andrea replied, “Great! Now all we need to do is figure out how to get some more business into this medical clinic. I was thinking that since you are a doctor as well, my next logical step would be to pass out pamphlets advertising your services around town.”
	Lisa responded, “I think that sounds like a good idea! We’ll just have to make sure that the people who get these pamphlets read them and come in.”
	Andrea said, “Exactly! So now I just have to figure out how to accomplish that… Oh, and there was one other thing I wanted to tell you about. Would you like to be my campaign manager? I know that your mother isn’t up for running for mayor again, but since she is my mother-in-law and she does know a lot of people here in Mayberry, I think this would be a good first step as we try to get our name out there. Don’t worry about how much time you will have to spend on this because even if we end up winning the election, you’ll still be able to work at the clinic. This is just a stepping stone for us! What do you say?”
	She smiled at Lisa and then continued, “Oh, and one other thing. My campaign manager will have to get her hair cut and maybe she should also dye it a different color. I think that red looks good on you! We will have a makeover day for you so that we can show the town how beautiful you are!”
	Lisa looked over at her mother, who was standing by the doorway to the room and listening to her. When she noticed that Daisy was still standing there, she turned back to Andrea and said, “You know Mom…I can’t really see myself working for you, especially since part of my job would be getting my hair cut and dying it this funny color. It’s just that I am working so hard on my internship right now, and I really don’t want to let anyone down by not doing a good job. It has been an amazing experience so far – I can’t believe that the chief of surgery is letting me assist him with all of his surgeries! The way he talks to me when we are in the operating room makes me feel like I am already a real doctor.”
	“So you don’t want to work for me? Maybe this isn’t such a good idea, but it was worth asking anyway. We should go talk about it in the kitchen. Maybe Charles could talk some sense into you.”
	“I don’t want to let you down either, Dr. Grayson, but the two of you are being so generous with your time and your money that I think maybe it would be okay if I just got another job somewhere else. You know…to help pay the bills and stuff. I can work anywhere…I just need to make some money!”
	Andrea thought for a minute and then said, “Okay dear – it was worth a try to ask. Here comes Charles now; he can tell you that it would definitely be worth your time and effort if you agreed to work for me.”
	Charles came in the door with a worried look on his face and said, “Lisa…this is the most important decision you will ever make in your life. If you agree to work for Andrea, it could change your whole future…not just for that year of your internship, but for the rest of your life! I have worked with hundreds of interns over the years, and I can tell from working with you just today that you have what it takes to do very well in this profession. You are already so good at it! There are only two reasons why you should not accept Andrea’s offer: if you really don’t want to take care of sick people and make their lives better, or you don’t like the people she works with. But of course, she doesn’t have to offer you a job…you can always turn her down politely.”
	Lisa thought about his words for a few minutes and decided to accept the offer. She said, “Thank you both very much for all of your help with my career choice. I’ve thought about everything you said this afternoon and decided there’s only one thing left to do…I accept her offer!”
	Charles was so happy that he literally threw his head back and laughed out loud, saying, “Well done my dear…well done! I know how much it means to you and I am very proud of you! Now then, what would be a good time for us to start training together?”
	Andrea smiled with pride and said, “I already have a list of all the places in Mayberry where we should make house calls. We can begin next week. By the way, I want something in",0
"Kyle Johnson, a man Aimee met at work, comes over to visit and the two quickly become friends.","pretty lonely. It’s nice to have company when you get home.”

Aimee smiled again and asked, “So why do you work nights? Do you have kids?”

Kyle chuckled and said, “No, I don’t have any kids. I guess it just seemed like a good fit for me because of my schedule. I go to school during the day and then work at night so I don’t have to worry about being there for family events or whatever. Also, in my field it pays more money to work nights, which is nice too.”

Aimee pondered for a moment about Kyle’s situation and said, “That’s cool that you found a job that fits your schedule like that. You must have worked really hard to get where you are right now.”

Kyle chuckled again and said, “I guess so, yeah. It took a while to get where I am now but it was worth it in the end, I think.”

Aimee asked Kyle what he majored in and he replied that he was getting a degree in biology. Aimee then told him about her major and Kyle was interested. They talked more about their college experience and other things they had in common. After a few hours of talking, Aimee excused herself to go and get some more wine from the kitchen. She went to the kitchen but paused as she saw Kyle sitting on her couch, staring at his phone. He looked up when he heard her come in but said nothing, only looking at Aimee expectantly. Aimee walked over and handed Kyle the glass of wine she had brought back with her. She sat next to him on the couch and they continued talking as they drank their wine.

After a while, Aimee sighed and said, “I’m glad you came over today, Kyle. It’s nice to have someone to talk to again, especially when I come home from school or work and it feels like my apartment is empty.”

Kyle asked, “Well, are you seeing anyone? Are you dating anyone? Don’t you have any other friends who are single who could hang out with you or something when you get home? You know…someone who might understand what you’re going through?”

Aimee smiled and said, “I should have known that would come up. No, I’m not dating anyone. I haven’t been on a date since my ex and I broke up. And no, I don’t have any other single friends who live anywhere near here. And no, none of my friends would understand what I am going through because pretty much everyone has someone in their life that they can talk to about these things. Everyone except for me and maybe a few others who seem content being alone all the time. None of them are happy about it though, not really.”

Kyle nodded in agreement. He felt sad for Aimee but he didn’t know how to make her feel better about her situation. He hoped that she would get over her ex someday and meet someone new, maybe someone who was perfect for her. Then they could have lots of fun together, with someone they both love and trust and can be intimate with too.

Kyle took Aimee’s hand and said quietly, “I hope that you meet someone someday soon who makes you feel wonderful again. Someone who deserves to be in your life and your heart. Aimee smiled at Kyle and he felt a warm wave of happiness flow over him as his eyes met hers. She was lovely, so lovely.

“Right now Aimee, I just want you to know that I am here for you. If you ever need a shoulder to lean on or a friend to talk to, I am right here and ready to listen,” Kyle said. He meant what he said too. He really did want Aimee to meet someone one day soon but he could wait until she was ready for that. It would happen sooner or later anyway, he hoped that it would be sooner rather than later though.

Kyle picked up his tea and took a sip before saying goodbye to Aimee because he had work to go back to. She walked him out and the two said goodbye to each other on her doorstep, their arms wrapped around each other until Kyle turned around and walked away.

Aimee watched him leave and then went back inside her apartment building. Before she closed the door she turned around as if seeking Kyle’s presence one last time before he left her sight for good. She smiled at the memory of how good it felt to hold him and hug him, but then the reality of his separation from her came over her and she was left facing her empty apartment.

Aimee walked in and closed the door behind herself. Her eyes fixed themselves on the living room ahead of her and Aimee’s lips formed a frown as she took in her surroundings.

Kyle had been right when he told Aimee that she was a beautiful person inside and out but right now, Aimee was feeling anything but beautiful. She wanted to curl up into a little ball and cry but that idea didn’t sound appealing right now, she just wanted to be alone and that didn’t really fit into the realm of feeling beautiful.

Aimee sat down on her sofa in the living room because that was where Kyle had been when he visited her earlier. Aimee took a seat facing the door and stared at it for a while, perhaps hoping that Kyle would come back to see her again.

Aimee stood up and decided to go to bed because she knew that if she was going to feel more lonely than she already did right now then it was best that she just rest.

Aimee walked over to her bedroom and changed into bed clothes before putting on her pyjamas. She washed her face",1
Jenna Adams meets Brian Johnson and immediately feels drawn to him.,"Brian Johnson looked at his watch as he sat in the lobby of the airport hotel. He was tired, and had to be at work early in the morning. He decided to get some rest before taking a shower and heading out for his flight home. He was going home after spending the weekend with Jenna Adams in her hometown in Minnesota. They had met in New York City about a year ago, and had been dating since then. Brian found Jenna to be an intelligent, beautiful, and interesting woman.  She was also an independent one who refused to get married or have children while she was still young. She did not want anyone to control her life or her decisions. Brian and Jenna both agreed to live together, but were not going to get married until they were well into their thirties.  Brian thought that was the right decision for them, but sometimes he wondered if marrying Jenna would not be the best choice for their future. He was almost thirty-two, and she was twenty-six.  Yet, even though they were six years apart in age, Jenna always told him he looked much younger than his age would suggest. In fact, he looked more like he was only about twenty-two or twenty-three years old when she saw him for the first time on the street corner. Brian had been working as a graphic designer for an advertising agency for over four years.  Jenna was an assistant editor at a publishing firm that focused on childrenís books. She was often traveling to different cities promoting various authors and their latest books. Brian was also impressed that Jenna was not interested in becoming a parent while she still had her career going strong.  Still, he sometimes asked her if she wanted to have children at all someday. She always said that she did want to be a mother one day, but not until later in life when she would enjoy it most.  Jennaís work often took her away from home for long periods of time, even up to a few weeks at a time.  When Brian asked her if she ever missed him while she was away, she told him that she did, but only because he reminded her so much of what it was like to have a child in that he often felt comforted by being around her.  Jenna never had any children, and wanted to wait until the right time in her life to become a parent, just as she wanted to wait until after college and her career before deciding whether or not to get married.  Brian felt that marriage would be an important step for both of them.  He felt that Jenna had settled down a lot in recent years and he thought that maybe it was time for her to settle down with someone.  He thought if more commitment would make her happy, then she should try it out, but he didnít want to pressure her into making any commitments.

Brian was beginning to feel that Jennaís reluctance to commit made him feel more uncomfortable than he had realized.  He felt that their relationship was a great one.  They did almost everything together. They played cards together, went out to movies and restaurants, and even bought groceries together at the supermarket.  They were not arguing often or fighting much at all, but he sensed that their relationship was beginning to become stagnant.  He didnít want to put pressure on her by asking her if she wanted to get married and have children one day, but he did want something different out of their relationship than what they were currently able to share together.  He thought it was time for something new.

Brian decided to meet Jenna downtown one evening for dinner at a local restaurant.  He wanted to talk about some of his feelings with her and see what Jenna thought about things too.  He knew that she had previously expressed her reservations about marriage, but felt that they should talk more openly and honestly about their future together. Brian felt that he was unsure about whether or not he should propose to Jenna, but he felt that they needed to spend more time together.  He felt that spending more time with each other would help them both decide what was best for the future of their relationship.

Brian decided to take a quick bath before meeting Jenna at her office so he could relax and look his best when he saw her again.  After taking a quick shower, Brian stepped out into the bedroom and noticed how nice everything looked in the room.  He wondered if maybe they should redecorate soon or if they should even move into a bigger house with more bedrooms.

Brian realized that he wanted Jenna to be happy and had come to the realization that maybe marriage was what she needed in order to be truly happy.  She seemed more relaxed when she spent time with her friends who were married or had children.  They just seemed happier than her single friends and Brian decided that he was ready to make a commitment as well.

He wondered if he should propose to Jenna now or wait until they went out for dinner after work this evening.  He thought that if he proposed then, it would give them something to look forward to over the weekend and they would have something new to talk about.  Jenna had mentioned previously that she wanted a ring with diamonds when they got married so Brian decided he should probably shop for one today.

He headed into the bedroom and picked up his cell phone.  He immediately felt nervous when he thought about calling Jenna but then quickly realized that she wanted him to call her.  He realized that it was time to step up and be a man and call her so he dialed the number on his cell phone.

Brian looked at his cell phone and saw that Jenna was calling him back so he quickly answered the phone saying, “Hello?”

Jenna answered the phone saying, “Hey baby!”

Brian felt immediately attracted to Jenna because of her casual tone in which she spoke.  He had not realized how much he missed her voice until she said those words to him.  He didn’t want to get too excited but instead asked her when they were meeting for lunch at work today.

Jenna replied, “Oh, I’m so sorry Brian.  I totally forgot about our appointment today.  We can meet for lunch later this afternoon if you like?",1
Kyle comforts Aimee and the two share a heart-to-heart conversation that leaves Aimee feeling understood for the first time.,"end the way she feared hers might end, but couldn’t help it. She knew Kyle loved being married and he wanted his son to be happy, so that they could be around for one another. But Aimee didn’t understand how he had been able to do what she couldn’t – get married.

She didn’t understand how someone could be with only one person for the rest of their life; loved only that person and no one else; never had any desire or interest in being with anyone else. She felt like it was a waste of time and energy to spend so much time thinking about something like that when there were more important things in life to worry about.

Kyle had said that he didn’t feel like he was just one person who could only love one other person forever. He felt like he loved Aimee and his wife equally but in different ways, and never felt like there was any kind of competition between the two loves. Aimee wanted to be able to feel the same way as Kyle, but her love for him wasn’t like that. She knew she could never love anyone else as much as she loved Kyle. And it was because Kyle loved his wife and son so much that Aimee realized she would never be able to compete with them in his heart.

Kyle had been sweet and comforting all those times Aimee had called him while crying, upset about the pain she felt and how afraid and alone she felt. He was always there to listen and talk to her about things, but he never seemed to be able to make her feelings go away.

He had talked about how much they both loved each other and that they would be together forever, no matter what happened, but Aimee knew that his words were just empty promises. She had known from the moment Kyle said those words that it wasn’t true; that he didn’t know himself or what he was saying.

She felt it in his voice when he said those words; how hollow they were, and how he probably didn’t even mean them at all. And now he was hundreds of miles away from her, with his wife and his son whom he loved more than anything else in the world.

Aimee looked down at herself and realized she was still wearing her green shirt with the yellow skirt that she had worn to work that morning. She wore the same thing almost everyday, and Kyle probably didn’t even notice anymore. He probably just took it for granted that she would be there every day, that she wouldn’t be gone for days on end because of her illness. She looked out the window and saw the trees swaying in the light breeze that was blowing leaves around everywhere. They didn’t sway like they used to; they swayed and fell over with hardly a sound, like they were tired and weak, ready to give up on life.

She felt just like them; exhausted and desperate for someone to comfort her with kind words and soft touches. Someone who would understand her, be there for her when she needed them.

Kyle wouldn’t understand that, Aimee thought to herself as she looked down at the floor again. He had never wanted children, didn’t like or want to deal with children. Yet he had married a woman who had a son who was only three years old, and Kyle loved him just as much as he loved Aimee. He had even talked about how they would someday live in the house with the white picket fence together, and have six kids just like “Leave it to Beaver.”

Aimee didn’t understand how Kyle could say that, especially since he never wanted children. She didn’t understand why he would have said that if he knew she would hear it. She didn’t understand why she should want to be with anyone who didn’t love her as much as she loved them. And she didn’t understand why Kyle had married Donna and moved away from her into a different state; only coming back to see her every few weeks or so and spend a few hours together before heading back home.

She felt Kyle leave the room then, didn’t turn around to look at him as he walked by her. She heard him talking on the phone, asking someone where they were, hoping they would see Aimee for a little while. She sighed and turned around finally; she wanted to leave but he still owned half of the apartment and she couldn’t afford to pay for both of them.

Kyle didn’t look at her when he walked past her and into the kitchen; she heard the refrigerator door open and close then he walked back into the living room, only a few steps away from where Aimee was sitting on the sofa. He sat down next to her and rested his head in his hands, sighing loudly as he tried to hold back tears.

“Kyle?” Aimee asked quietly, not sure if there was anything anyone could say to make this easier.

Kyle looked up and smiled at her with a look of sincerity that warmed her heart. “Hey sweetie, I just wanted to tell you something-”

Aimee put a hand on his for several moments before speaking. “I understand why you married Donna now.”

Kyle looked confused for a few seconds before he understood what she was saying. “Why?” He asked, confused but curious. “What do you mean?”

Aimee turned her head to look at him, wanting to be near him even if he couldn’t understand her completely. “I know why you married her, even though you never told me. And it’s okay because I understand now-”

Kyle lifted his head up to look at Aimee and shook his head slowly as he tried to understand what she was saying. “You do?” He asked, still not sure what she meant.

Aimee nodded and took a deep breath before continuing. “I know that you married her because you were afraid of being alone, just like me. And I know that you moved away from me because you thought it would be easier for both of us if we weren’t together. But I also know that you did it because you loved me and didn’t want to hurt me.”

Kyle was silent for a few moments as he processed what Aimee had said. He leaned over and hugged her tightly, tears streaming down his face as he finally allowed himself to grieve for the life he could have had with her.",1
"Daisy's daughter, Lisa, becomes her primary caregiver and works tirelessly to find a treatment that will save her mother's life.","that they could to see that she stayed healthy and happy.
	Charles came in just as she was finished with her report, and Dr. Davis came in right after he heard the news from Tanya, who had been crying as she delivered the news to him. He went directly into Lisa’s office with tears streaming down his face and held his wife tightly while sobbing out loud. She hugged him back tightly as she tried to comfort him the only way that she knew how.
	She didn’t get a chance to do very much comforting before Daisy came up for breath. “I am so sorry, Lisa. I should have just let you take care of me from the beginning before I even went through all of this other stuff. If I would have just died, you wouldn’t have had to go through this emotional trauma. It must hurt like crazy for you to know what has happened, and then have to tell me about it right after the fact. I hope that you will give me a chance to make it up to you, sweetie.”
	After all of the crying was finally done, Lisa and Charles went to talk with Daisy privately so that they could discuss what would need to happen from here forward. They told her that there were no longer any options available for treatment because her cancer was too advanced, but they offered to do everything possible to help her feel as comfortable as possible. She agreed to let them give her pain medication, and they set up a schedule for when she would be receiving it on a regular basis. They assured her that they would work together closely to make sure that she was not in any pain at all, and they were both grateful that she had accepted their offer.
	Lisa made arrangements for someone else to take over seeing patients at the clinic for the next week so that she could spend every available moment with her mother. That would give her more time to work on a plan for taking care of things when it became necessary for her to go back home to Mayberry, and it would also allow her one more week of peace and quiet before she had to make a difficult decision about how best to handle her situation in the future. She needed peace and quiet in order to come up with a plan so that she could feel good about the decisions that she made.
	She wanted to continue working at the clinic, but knew that it didn’t make sense for her to be able to do so if she didn’t have someone who could watch her children. She wasn’t ready to give them up, but knew that she would have to do so at some point, because she couldn’t bear the thought of them being raised by people other than her.
	When a medical emergency came into the clinic that required Lisa’s immediate attention, she looked at the clock and said to herself that she should call her sister and let her know. She dialed the number, but it went to voicemail. Then she remembered that her sister was spending the week with their brother-in-law’s family who had gone up to Lake Tahoe for a vacation. So, she dialed his number and let him know that she would need a babysitter for the evening if he wasn’t going to be busy. He couldn’t remember if they had any plans or not, so he promised to call her back.
	As she waited for his call, Lisa ran through various scenarios in her mind about what might happen in the coming months and how she might be able to resolve them. She did not want to leave Mayberry, but knew that it would become necessary if she was going to get the kind of treatment that she needed. The idea of moving, however, frightened her even more than losing her mother to cancer.
	The prospect of moving, coupled with the fact that she had not heard anything from Charles, caused her to feel depressed. But she refused to fall apart now when her mother needed her strength the most. So, she pushed all thoughts of the future out of her mind and focused on helping a patient who came into the clinic with a cut on his arm that required stitches. She did an excellent job stitching up the wound and asked him if he wanted something to numb the pain before she finished sewing him up.
	He said, “Oh no ma’am. It doesn’t hurt at all. This here is a very clean cut. You should be able to stitch me up with no problem at all.”
	Lisa smiled and said, “Well I’m glad to hear that you don’t feel any pain, but I think that you should try the cream at least. It will make it much easier for you, and besides, you might not feel any pain right now, but it will definitely hurt later on. So, why don’t you just humor me and try the cream?”
	The man said, “I suppose you’re right ma’am, I don’t want to be in pain later on if I can help it. You see, I have a lot of work to do over at the Mayberry General Hospital right after we finish up here. I can’t afford to be in pain and not be able to move my arm. So, if you think you need it then I will humor you and try the cream.”
	So, Lisa gave him some anesthesia for the pain and finished stitching him up. When they were done, she gave him some instructions for how to care for his wound before sending him on his way.
	The patient said, “Thank you ma’am! This wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. You really are one heck of a doctor! If I ever get sick again then I would love to come back here and see you.”
	Lisa smiled and said, “Thank you sir. That is very kind of you to say that. Please be sure to come back when you are in need of a doctor’s services. You can visit either my office or Daisy",1
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,"authors and musicians.

Aimee’s eyes lit up at being able to talk about books and movies with someone else who loved them as much as she did, but Kyle was having a hard time getting into it. He wanted to be listening and watching a movie at the same time, and he was finding it hard to do both at the same time.

Kyle Johnson took out a packet of candy from his jacket pocket and offered Aimee some. They sat in silence for a few moments while munching on their treats, each lost in their own thoughts. Aimee finally spoke. “I struggle with connecting to people,” she said. “There’s a lot of things I want to share about myself, but I don’t know who I can talk to about them. And sometimes I worry that no one will understand what I have to say.” 

Kyle was silent for a moment. “I know how that feels,” he said softly.

“It must be really difficult being in advertising,” Aimee said. “You have to deal with a lot of people all the time, and if you can’t connect with them… I just couldn’t do that. I would be terrible at it.”

“Like you said, it is a struggle,” Kyle said slowly. “And sometimes I wonder if it’s worth it. But then I feel selfish for  feeling that way because I do enjoy the job.” He paused and looked at Aimee, who was studying the TV intently. “But as you said, when it comes to life in general, I have a hard time connecting with people.”

Aimee glanced up at Kyle. She felt grateful to him for listening and not interrupting her. “I don’t mean this in a bad way, Kyle, but you seem like the kind of guy who doesn’t care about what people think of him. You never seem to  worry about what other people are thinking of you.”

Kyle nodded slowly. “I suppose that’s true, but I can sense when I’m being judged by other people, even if it’s not obvious. And it makes me feel alone in the world. It drives me nuts and sometimes I feel like I want to run away.”

Aimee felt a pang in her chest. She had never shared this feeling with anyone before, and she was startled to hear Kyle admit he felt the same way. Kyle seemed so calm and confident when he talked about his feelings. He really understood what Aimee was saying, which made her feel even more isolated from the world than before. She was still clutching her old teddy bear in her hands. “Sometimes I wish I could be like you, Kyle. Sometimes I feel like I’m stuck inside my own head and the world is a big scary place and I just want to hide under my bed or something. Sometimes I feel like when I’m alone, that no one really cares about me and it makes me sad.”",1
"Shannon commits suicide, leaving her husband and young son behind.",".

When Brad saw Karen walk in, he stopped what he was doing and went over towards the door to greet her. Before he could open his mouth, however, she jumped on him and gave him a big hug as if they were long-lost friends. When they finally parted, Brad looked back at Shannon who was just sitting there alone, drinking her beer with a frown on her face.

No one said anything for a moment until Brad broke the silence by saying, “Is that your girlfriend?” Then he looked at Shannon who replied quietly, “No … we’re not together anymore. We broke up last week after you told me about Cindy.”

Then Brad turned back towards Karen and said, “I want to thank you for everything you did for me when I started working out at your house. You really motivated me to work harder than I ever did before.” At that moment, Karen and Brad got a little too close and were almost kissing when they heard someone walk into the room. When they turned around to see who it was, they saw a tall man standing there staring at them with his arms folded across his chest.

It was Jeremy Barton. They all stood there staring at each other in silence for a few moments until Shannon broke the tension by saying, “Who are you?”

The young man looked from one person to the other before answering. “I’m … I’m Shannon’s son. I just moved in with my dad and I haven’t seen my mom in years.”

The parents looked at each other and smiled before turning back towards their son. “Why didn’t you say you were coming? We would have come and picked you up!” Shannon exclaimed.

The young man replied, “I didn’t know you guys were going to be here tonight. I wasn’t planning on coming home until tomorrow morning though … so it doesn’t matter. I asked my friend if he could give me a ride home and he said yes.”

Shannon raised her eyebrows and asked, “You didn’t have your car here with you? You drove here in someone else’s car? Where is your car?”

The young man replied, “Well … I had to leave my car in California because I couldn’t afford to ship it back here. I do have a bike but I was too lazy to put the tires on it before I left. My friend wasn’t going to drive me home if I didn’t commit to something, so tonight was the first night of soccer practice.”

Shannon smiled then and said, “Well it’s about time you learned how to ride a bike anyways. We can take care of that tomorrow after work, okay? Okay. How was your flight? Do you want something to drink? Oh! I know! Brad … can you make sure he has something to drink? And some food maybe? Yeah! Let’s go to the store! It’s probably closed now but we can open it up and get some stuff. Hang on a second son.”

Shannon turned towards her husband and said, “This is your chance to do something for your son. He just flew all the way here from California. He’s probably starving and thirsty. Don’t you want a chance at one more good impression before he leaves town again?”

Brad smiled and shook his head, then he said, “Okay. Let’s go to the store.”

Shannon’s smile faded quickly as she looked at him and then back at her son, who was leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. They left the house together and went to Brad’s mother’s house to wait for him in her car. Shannon turned on the radio and they both sat quietly in the front seat with their eyes closed.

Shannon said, “I need to ask you something … and I just want you to be honest. Do you think that maybe I’m like a mother figure for him or something? Do you think that he sees me as a mother figure? Is that why he wants to talk to me all the time? Have I been replaced with my own son, Brad? Have I been replaced by a kid that only knows me for two weeks of his life but not even as long as we were together? Do you think there’s any chance I could ever be the mother of my own child again in this lifetime or am I doomed to become a woman who is never seen as a female ever again because all men will only see me as a mother figure from now on?”

Brad said, “Shannon! You are Shannon. You are the most beautiful woman in the world and I love you more than anything. We are a family and we always will be. Of course you can have kids. We can adopt if we want, although I don’t see that happening anytime soon, and also … I love you so much. You know that, right? You know how much I love you … right?”

Shannon turned the radio off and she turned to look at him. She shook her head and said, “I think I have ruined everything. I think that maybe it was best if we just divorced and gave him up for adoption. We could get rid of his stuff so he has nothing to come back to and we could just move on with our lives separately … without each other … without a child … without each other. No one would know about us anymore and we could just be two people who never knew each other but were friends for a while. We could still love everyone we already love. Everything would be normal and happy again.”

Shannon cried into her hand and Brad rubbed her back and said, “Oh, Shannon … don’t say that. Everything is going to be okay. I promise you, I",0
The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"’s. She is a GP too and she always needs the business!”
	The man laughed, “You know I think I will do that! So thank you again for saving me from having an awful scar on my arm for the rest of my life!”
	And with that, he left the exam room and went on his way.
	Andrea came in to see how things were going and found Lisa sitting at her desk, trying to sort through the paperwork that she had started gathering as her mother began dictating the details of each patient’s visit.
	She asked, “So how did everything go?”
	Lisa replied, still sorting through the receipts and files, “It went pretty well. There was one patient who wanted a prescription for some pain medication but I refused to give it to him because I thought that he just wanted some pills for recreational use. Oh, and I changed our appointment book so that you have some free time tomorrow and the rest of the week. So yay! No more working late!”
	Andrea replied, “Great! Now all we need to do is figure out how to get some more business into this medical clinic. I was thinking that since you are a doctor as well, my next logical step would be to pass out pamphlets advertising your services around town.”
	Lisa responded, “I think that sounds like a good idea! We’ll just have to make sure that the people who get these pamphlets read them and come in.”
	Andrea said, “Exactly! So now I just have to figure out how to accomplish that… Oh, and there was one other thing I wanted to tell you about. Would you like to be my campaign manager? I know that your mother isn’t up for running for mayor again, but since she is my mother-in-law and she does know a lot of people here in Mayberry, I think this would be a good first step as we try to get our name out there. Don’t worry about how much time you will have to spend on this because even if we end up winning the election, you’ll still be able to work at the clinic. This is just a stepping stone for us! What do you say?”
	She smiled at Lisa and then continued, “Oh, and one other thing. My campaign manager will have to get her hair cut and maybe she should also dye it a different color. I think that red looks good on you! We will have a makeover day for you so that we can show the town how beautiful you are!”
	Lisa looked over at her mother, who was standing by the doorway to the room and listening to her. When she noticed that Daisy was still standing there, she turned back to Andrea and said, “You know Mom…I can’t really see myself working for you, especially since part of my job would be getting my hair cut and dying it this funny color. It’s just that I am working so hard on my internship right now, and I really don’t want to let anyone down by not doing a good job. It has been an amazing experience so far – I can’t believe that the chief of surgery is letting me assist him with all of his surgeries! The way he talks to me when we are in the operating room makes me feel like I am already a real doctor.”
	“So you don’t want to work for me? Maybe this isn’t such a good idea, but it was worth asking anyway. We should go talk about it in the kitchen. Maybe Charles could talk some sense into you.”
	“I don’t want to let you down either, Dr. Grayson, but the two of you are being so generous with your time and your money that I think maybe it would be okay if I just got another job somewhere else. You know…to help pay the bills and stuff. I can work anywhere…I just need to make some money!”
	Andrea thought for a minute and then said, “Okay dear – it was worth a try to ask. Here comes Charles now; he can tell you that it would definitely be worth your time and effort if you agreed to work for me.”
	Charles came in the door with a worried look on his face and said, “Lisa…this is the most important decision you will ever make in your life. If you agree to work for Andrea, it could change your whole future…not just for that year of your internship, but for the rest of your life! I have worked with hundreds of interns over the years, and I can tell from working with you just today that you have what it takes to do very well in this profession. You are already so good at it! There are only two reasons why you should not accept Andrea’s offer: if you really don’t want to take care of sick people and make their lives better, or you don’t like the people she works with. But of course, she doesn’t have to offer you a job…you can always turn her down politely.”
	Lisa thought about his words for a few minutes and decided to accept the offer. She said, “Thank you both very much for all of your help with my career choice. I’ve thought about everything you said this afternoon and decided there’s only one thing left to do…I accept her offer!”
	Charles was so happy that he literally threw his head back and laughed out loud, saying, “Well done my dear…well done! I know how much it means to you and I am very proud of you! Now then, what would be a good time for us to start training together?”
	Andrea smiled with pride and said, “I already have a list of all the places in Mayberry where we should make house calls. We can begin next week. By the way, I want something in",0

Daisy Mayberry receives a diagnosis of cancer and her family and friends come together to support her.,"In Mayberry, a town on the outskirts of nowhere, the news of Daisy Mayberry’s illness spread quickly. It didn’t take long for everyone to hear that her cancer had returned. Soon as word got out, people came out of the woodwork to help and pray for her.
	Her husband Charles Grayson, Daisy’s closest friend Tanya Swanson and even the little old ladies down at Mayberry’s Café were concerned about her. Her illness would bring them all together in a way they had never been before.
	Daisy Mayberry was a kindhearted, loving woman in her early 50’s who everyone loved. She was the wife of Charles Grayson and the mother of two children: daughter Lisa Marie and son Joe. She was also the grandmother to six little girls and one boy who all lived across the country with their mothers or fathers.
	She was diagnosed with breast cancer just eight years ago when her youngest grandchild was only three. She had beaten it then, but sadly, it had returned. This time the doctors told her that there was little they could do for her. They said that she may have a couple of months left to live. Daisy’s family and friends were devastated. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer again and they all knew that she probably would not see Christmas.
	They came together to help and support her as much as they could. Her husband, Charles, was at her side helping her get through the pain of it all. Her daughter Lisa Marie was also at her side helping take care of her mother throughout the day, as well as taking care of her children who were in school.
	Daisy’s son Joe worked from home taking business calls during the day and helping his father tend to his mother at night when Charles would get home from work.
	Her friends Tanya Swanson and Andrea Grayson were also there for her every day, helping them however they could with food and other things around the house. Everyone came over once a week to sit with Daisy and hold her hand, or make sure that she was getting enough rest. They would go in shifts so that everyone had a chance to visit with Daisy without worrying about whether it was their turn or not. They sat by her bedside and tried as best they could to comfort her when she would cry for hours on end. She would scream out in pain from the cancer eating away at her bones, making it impossible for her to move without being in agony. But she knew that her family loved her and that they were there with her, and that made it easier to bear the pain.
	They were all there for her, holding on to hope that a miracle would happen and that she would beat this cancer once again.
	They had been through this before and no one knew what to expect, even though they had all lost faith that anything would happen. They were all scared, but more than anything else they wanted her to get better soon.
	The day came when she started complaining about not feeling well, and then the pain started coming back in a big way. Everyone thought that her time was finally here, but they stayed with her all night as she got worse and worse. Finally it was the middle of the next day and no one had heard anything from Daisy since the night before, and they started to worry about what was going on with her.
	Then a few minutes later there was a knock at the door, and everyone jumped up at once. There were tears of joy on their faces as they ran into the room to see her standing there looking very healthy and well rested. They were all crying tears of joy at having been reunited with Daisy again, but no one was happier than Charles because it meant that they would all be able to keep on caring for Daisy and hope for another miracle.
	They all hugged her and told her how happy they were to see her doing so well, and then they got back into bed with her so that she could tell them how it all came about.
	“I saw this old friend of mine named Dr. Davis,” said Daisy Mayberry. “He looked me up on the internet and called me in for an examination right away. I went to see him because I had a feeling that something was wrong, so I decided that he would be the one to find out what it was. He did some tests and asked me a bunch of questions, then he told me that there is something else wrong with me, but it’s not my cancer. It’s something much worse! You all better get ready for what I have to tell you now because it might just make you cry!”
	They all sat down in the chairs lining the sides of her bed again, and they prepared themselves for whatever news they were about to hear next.
	“I have Stage 4 heart failure and I need a heart transplant right away because there is nothing that medicine can do to help me,” Daisy Mayberry said. “The cancer is killing me, but the heart failure is going to kill me faster if it’s not treated. We are still praying for a miracle, but we will start looking into treatments that might help the cancer even though there is no hope and no cure for it. Dr. Davis says that I don’t have long to live, so I probably won’t be around much longer to see my grandson go on his mission or to send my daughter off to college next year. I feel so bad that I won’t be around to see all the wonderful things that are going to happen in our lives, but at least my grandbaby will be able to go on his mission if he decides that he wants to serve a mission someday. I can’t wait to see him do it! He is going to make a wonderful missionary, and I wish so bad that I could be there with him too.”
	All of this was devastating news for everyone in her family, but they wouldn’t think about that right now. They just wanted to concentrate on getting her healthy again. She was their number one priority and they were all going to do everything",1
"John Doe, the serial killer, tells Valerie that she must escape the basement before dawn or else she will become his next trophy.","She began to cry.

“It’s okay,” she said through her tears. “I won’t tell anyone what you did to me. I just want to go home now.”

Valerie sat alone in the room for a few minutes, feeling helpless and afraid. She began to believe that she really would become his next victim, so she began to panic. She didn’t want that to be her last memory of life — dying in a strange basement with no one left to mourn her passing. If she was going to die, she wanted more than anything for someone — anyone — to know what had happened so they would know the truth about John Doe, and maybe they would even find a way to catch him in the end.

But if Valerie was not going to die, then she needed a way to get out of the basement and away from John Doe before he returned. She knew she couldn’t just wait for help to come looking for her, because John Doe knew who she was and where she lived. He would get rid of her body before anyone came looking for her. She had to find a way to escape on her own.

She remembered what John Doe had said about the basement being surrounded by cameras, so she had to be very careful about any actions that she took. She decided that the best course of action would be to try to find a hidden key or some other means of escape and then just try to sneak out from the back door as quietly as possible. John Doe might notice her missing as soon as he got home, but Valerie knew there was only a slim chance that he would figure out who had come into his house and stolen his trophy in the few minutes that she had left.

After spending what seemed like an eternity trying every possible hiding place in the room, Valerie became desperate for any kind of clue that would let her know where to look next. She began to think that maybe she was wasting precious time by trying to escape when all she really needed to do was sit quietly and wait until morning so John Doe could come back and kill her like he had promised.

Valerie began to despair when, suddenly, she saw something flash by behind the big screen TV in front of the fireplace. She moved over and squinted to get a better look at what was hidden behind the screen, but all she could make out were several thin wires, which appeared to connect the TV to another, smaller, television set that had been mounted on the wall.

Valerie decided that she could ignore the cord and search for the key in another part of the room, but then she remembered that John Doe had said he set up cameras all around his basement. If there were cameras in this room, then she knew there would be one near the door leading out of the basement, so maybe if she moved closer to it, she might be able to see where it was hidden.

She moved around in front of the screen and saw that it was connected to a DVD player. She couldn’t quite make out what was playing on the screen, but by looking at the DVD’s on the top shelf of the entertainment center next to it, Valerie was able to determine that there were several movies stacked up in the player and that none of them looked like they had been watched since they had been rented. She also saw that there were several remote controls on the table near the TV, along with some candy wrappers and wine bottles. Valerie wondered who these movies and goodies belonged to while she searched for the key behind a stack of old newspapers lying on top of an end table next to the sofa.

Suddenly, she heard footsteps coming up the basement stairs. They were quick, heavy footsteps and not very quiet like John Doe’s. The steps stopped just outside the basement door, and a man’s voice demanded to know who was in there.

Valerie stopped searching for the key and stood still until she heard John Doe coming down the stairs into the basement. He called out to her but did not say anything about her having found the key to his handcuffs, and he didn’t say anything about the man who had invaded his house, either—instead, he asked her where she was hiding in the basement.

“I hid in here because I thought you weren’t going to kill me yet,” she said.

John Doe continued walking toward her, and Valerie tried to see his face around the edge of the television set but couldn’t tell if he was angry or if he was just trying to act scary. He moved around into her view and then she saw that he looked like he was feeling pretty good. He smirked at her as if he had just had a great idea, and Valerie knew then that this was going to be a very long night—she already had escaped from an axe murderer, and now she was facing execution by electric chair.

“I thought you were smarter than that,” John Doe said. “A man doesn’t hide, a man moves.”

Valerie stood up and walked over to the end of the wooden planks where there was a small space between the edge of the foundation and the concrete floor below. She thought about what John Doe had just said about moving, and she tried to think of a way out of this basement so that she wouldn’t end up being his next trophy. She couldn’t figure out how she could get out of there without being seen or heard by John Doe, and he told her that she would be his next trophy if she were caught before sunrise.

“You have until dawn to get out of this basement,” he said, “or I will cut off your head, put it on a spike right here by the door, and no one will ever find your body.”

Valerie wondered why he was so sure that no one would find her body. She also thought about what he had done to the other two women that she did not know about. She wondered how many",1
The world ends in a cataclysmic event.,"The world ended, the last fragments of humanity took shelter in the few remaining buildings; the rest of the area was filled with rubble from buildings that had collapsed in on themselves.

The survivors waited for the end to come. They had no food, no running water, no electricity, and only a few minutes before the last gasps of breath left their bodies. They had nowhere to run and nowhere to hide; they could only cower behind the remains of what used to be buildings.

They could hear it now; the sound of buildings collapsing, metal clanging loudly as it hit the ground, and glass shattering. Another building was going down. There would be no running out of this one.

They waited for what seemed like an eternity, but was only seconds; they knew that there was nothing left for them...only oblivion.  Slowly, as the last vestiges of life faded from their bodies, they were drawn into the darkness that awaited them. There would be no more pain, no more suffering; there would only be oblivion.

Then a strange blue light exploded in a flash before them, and they were gone...nothingness.

They found themselves standing in a vast expanse of darkness that slowly faded to reveal an enormous city. There was no evidence of life anywhere, but when they walked through the streets there was a feeling that something sinister lurked around the corner.

The last rays of light were disappearing from the sky as they entered a large building and started to explore its interior. Here, the last signs of life lingered; broken glass crunched under their feet and debris from destroyed rooms was strewn across the floor. They began to explore the wreckage as they wandered deeper into the building.

Then, suddenly, without warning or any indication whatsoever, the entire world around them disappeared and they once again found themselves in darkness. This time when it faded, something seemed different. They seemed to be in some sort of warehouse or staging area full of broken equipment; it was almost like a junkyard where they just happened to be standing amid the wreckage.

Suddenly, a huge explosion rocked the building and sent debris hurtling across the room. The world again disappeared, but this time when it returned around them they were in a strange new world that was unlike any place on earth. They were surrounded by rock formations and mountains that seemed to rise up almost vertically from the ground. It was an alien world, yet so oddly familiar; it looked like a world on some other planet, but when they looked around they could immediately tell that there were no other living creatures anywhere.

Their world had ended with a cataclysmic event, and the whole of humanity had been eradicated.

They were alone in this world, but there was no sign of death or decay anywhere; they were all still fully alive and so far miraculously unharmed by the ordeal they had just experienced. This was their chance to start anew.

Their world had ended in disaster, but this new one seemed to offer great possibilities; if they could build a society capable of supporting human life there was nothing to stop them from making something even better than the one that came before it. This would be a chance to start anew.

They looked around the strange new world, and realized what they would need to do in order to survive it long-term. They would have to rebuild society, they would have to make a home for themselves as best as they could.

For now though, their first priority was finding food and shelter from the elements.

They noticed that there were no trees anywhere in sight, not even the smallest specimens of shrubbery or ferns, and the dry lifelessness of the landscape suggested that humans were not native to this world.

With a little planning, they would be able to overcome this huge obstacle. For now, they had to be careful as it was getting worse with every passing moment. Darkness swiftly descended on the land, and as the sun disappeared over the horizon they felt an ominous chill descend on them.

This was going to be a very cold night indeed; they’d have to keep moving if they wanted to survive it.

There was nowhere to go, everything had ended in a fireball that engulfed the entire planet, but once the sun set there would be nothing left but death and darkness - unless they could find some shelter from the elements soon.

The world ended and everyone on it perished in a fiery inferno. The survivors didn’t know exactly what had happened, but they all agreed that this would be their chance to start anew. They couldn’t go back to their own world as it no longer existed; whatever had happened had completely eradicated civilization. Their own time period ceased to exist and was replaced by a dark new one where only death and destruction lay ahead of them. There were no more humans, or any other species for that matter, but if they could just keep moving then maybe they could survive long enough to start anew amongst the ashes of the world that had just gone up in flames.

They had to make it through these early hours before the sun set forever and plunged them into darkness, and they did not have long as it seemed to sink toward the horizon with each passing second. Their world was gone, as were all others; everything that had ever existed anywhere in the universe was now dust. All that remained of their former lives was the debris left behind in this post-apocalyptic wasteland.

As the survivors wandered lost through the ruins of human civilization they tried to piece together what had happened earlier today. They remembered seeing strange flashes of light in the sky and hearing distant explosions, but had dismissed it as nothing more than another military exercise gone awry.

Then something smashed into their own planet with such force that everyone on it was instantly incinerated. Then a giant fireball rose up into the night sky, and as it burned everything around it turned to ash - all life on the planet ended in an instant, and the survivors were forced to flee through a rain of burning debris without even knowing what had happened.

Now they wandered in fear, not knowing what this new world would hold for them",1
Gabriel moves out of his parents' house and into his own apartment.,"Gabriel stood in front of a moving van while his father, Julio Suarez, looked on.
  He was moving out of his mother’s house and into the place he had been saving up for since he was a teenager.
  Julio was just standing there watching him without any emotion.
  “Is this the way you want to be doing it?” he asked.
  Gabriel did not have a response, so Julio just started moving things from the van to the apartment.
  “You don’t think I should have gotten movers?” Gabriel asked.
  “I think you should have done it better than this,” Julio replied as he carried boxes inside. “That’s only because I know you better than anyone else, and I know what you are capable of.”
  When Julio was finally done moving everything from the van, Gabriel didn’t say anything. He just sat there on the couch that he had bought earlier that day and stared blankly at his father.
  Julio was in no hurry to leave, so he started talking for no reason other than to look busy.
  “You moved out without any warning or notice,” he said. “I hope you know that is not the way to do it. You don’t move out of a home you share with your parents and not give any explanation as to why.”
  Gabriel just stared at his father with his arms crossed. He had no intention of explaining anything to him, and there was really nothing to explain. He just didn’t want to live at home any longer. That was all that mattered to him.
  “I don’t understand why you are doing this,” Julio said softly. “You just finished college, and you still have plenty of time left before you have to start working full-time. Why are you in such a hurry? I thought we were going to spend the summer together, but now you are practically running away from me. You need to slow down and think about things a little bit more. Maybe you can take your time moving out so I can understand why you’re not coming home anymore.”
  “I need some space for myself is all,” Gabriel said with so much frustration that he started clenching his fists. He was getting tired of his father reminding him that he was still young and had the whole world ahead of him. He didn’t want to hear any of that, because he knew there was nothing else for him waiting around the corner.
  “You don’t want to give me space? You feel like you need to spend more time with your parents?”
  Gabriel moved closer to his father, and grabbed onto his shirt. His expression showed that he was about to explode from anger. “You don’t understand anything, do you? You don’t even know what it feels like to be me. I want my own place away from all the drama and stress here. I want to try being on my own for once in my life. Please just let me go now so I can get started on my own life without you following me everywhere I go.”
  Julio placed his hands on Gabriel’s shoulders, but he could feel that they were trembling from anger. “I will try to understand, but it will take some time for it to sink in. Please don’t think you have to move out now. You can stay with us until you figure out where you want to go next.”
  Gabriel looked at his father and tried to read what was going on in that mind of his. He was trying to think of the right words to come out of his mouth, but nothing came out. He looked left and right; he wanted to tell his parents how much he loved them and how grateful he was for the life they had given him; but all those words were locked up inside of him, because he had kept them bottled up inside for so long that he forgot how to speak. He did not know what to say or how to say it. All of the negative feelings that had accumulated inside of him over the years were starting to overflow, and he knew that if he opened his mouth, all those negative feelings would come spilling out like water bursting through a dam.
  After a few minutes of silence, Gabriel decided that moving out right now was a bad idea; maybe he would feel better in the morning.
  “Dad…I’m tired. I need to get some rest; I will move out tomorrow morning, and let me make this clear: I am moving out on my own.”
  Julio nodded approvingly, “That sounds like a good idea. I understand how you feel, son; we both have been living together for more than twenty years. I had my own apartment when I was your age and I moved back home because times were different then. But times have changed and I see the need to get some space from each other. What do you think?”
  Gabriel looked at his father with anger in his eyes, “Dad, don’t do that!”
  “Do what?” asked his father in confusion.
  Gabriel turned to his mother and said with venom in his voice, “Don’t treat me like a child! You have been doing that for years now! And you too, Dad! Both of you act like my parents, but neither of you has ever acted like my dad or mom! You have been acting like two friends who are just roommates sharing a house with their grown son! None of you has ever treated me like your kid who depends on both of you for everything, and it is time that I started acting like an adult.”
  His father looked at him sadly and said, “Son, why do you think I sent you to study all those years in Stanford? So that you could come back here and live with us? No",1
"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","Three weeks ago

Jenna Riley woke up in a cold sweat, her face damp with tears. Her heart was racing and her body shaking uncontrollably. She groaned and rolled over onto her side, cradling a pillow against her chest as she tried to calm down. Jenna had been having these nightmares for weeks now. Sometimes they were about the accident, but more often than not they were about being murdered. At first she thought that it was just an overactive imagination brought on by the accident, but the dreams kept getting worse and more detailed every time she had one. She wished that she could remember what they all meant.

Her cell phone, sitting on the bedside table, began to ring. When she saw the number flash up on the screen, her heart skipped a beat. It was her mom calling to check on her progress after Jenna had called in sick again from work. She didn’t want to get out of bed and talk to her mom, but it would be too embarrassing when she found out that she hadn’t called in sick.

Jenna groaned and put the pillow over her head as she picked up the phone. “Hi Mom,” Jenna said with a groggy voice.

“Hey honey, how are you feeling today?” Her mother asked.

“I don’t know what I have, but I feel like crap. Did you call work?” Jenna asked.

Her mother sighed. “No honey, I told them that you must have caught the worst cold in history. This place will fall apart without you there to run it,” her mother said lovingly.

Jenna laughed dryly and sighed loudly into the phone. “Mom, I can’t go to work today and I probably won’t be able to go tomorrow either. I just need to rest, that’s all. You can do everything at home just as good as I can,” Jenna said quietly.

Her mother sounded disappointed but understanding when she asked, “Are you really sick or are you just hung over from last night?”

Jenna rolled her eyes. “Mom, I don’t drink anymore. Look, I have to go now okay? Love you too.” Jenna hung up the phone and threw the covers off her body. Her head throbbed loudly and she felt nauseous whenshe stood up. She decided to take a shower, hoping that maybe it would help her headache to subside a little.

Jenna stepped into the shower and turned on the water, letting it run over her body slowly as she tried not to think about anything painful. The water was nice and warm on her body; it relieved some of the pain in her head. She closed her eyes and let the warm water run over her face; she felt so frustrated that she couldn’t remember what happened last night. She knew that a lot of bad things had happened, but all she could think about was what caused them.

“Gregory!” she screamed at the top of her lungs. She couldn’t understand why he had done it again; why he had almost killed her. He looked at her with a slight amount of concern, but there was also a glint in his eye that warned Jenna to not test him. She realized that he was going to punish her one way or another for disobeying him, so silently she stepped out of the shower and dried off. She then walked into the bedroom where Gregory stood waiting for her.

When he saw her, his smile widened and he said, “I’m glad that you were able to wake up so soon.”

Jenna looked down at the floor and answered timidly, “I-it wasn’t easy. My head hurts a lot.”

Gregory nodded in approval of her response. He walked over to the nightstand and picked up a bottle of pills. He turned around and walked back toward Jenna, holding out the pills he had taken out while he said in a gentle voice, “They should make you feel better.”

Jenna stared at the pills that were being held out to her, but she didn’t want them. She knew that they would make her forget what had happened last night. Then she would have no way of protecting herself from him if he attacked her again in the future.

“No, thank you,” she said firmly as she turned away from Gregory and put on her clothes.

Gregory turned back to the nightstand as if he hadn’t heard her response and popped another pill into his mouth. He then took a drink of water before turning back to Jenna and asking politely, “Breakfast?”Gregory hoped that food might provide her with the energy she would need to deal with him. He knew that he could no longer keep her locked away in their bedroom all day. She needed to spend some time outside of the bedroom so that her memory wouldn’t be as clear of what had happened to her. Gregory could see it in her eyes—the fear and the pain were now starting to fade from them. She was starting to accept what had happened as if it were her fault for having disobeyed him in the first place.

To keep her mind off of everything that had happened, Gregory wanted to take Jenna out and buy her a new outfit. He wanted her to go out into the world like normal people so that she would be able to remember how it felt again. The problem was that he didn’t have any money to do anything like that, not without telling Antonia where he got it from.

Gregory knew that his wife wouldn’t approve of what he was doing, but he didn’t care. He was worried that Jenna would start remembering what had happened to her and would end up telling someone else about it. It was better for Gregory if Jenna forgot every detail of what had happened,",0
Julia finally learns the truth about the visions.,"guilty?”

Julia sobbed as she stumbled back towards her bedroom. She could no longer hold back her tears as she cried, “I know that I was right to stay at home, but now I am scared to go out again! It doesn’t matter how many times you tell me I am safe, I don’t know if you are telling the truth!”

Julia sobbed again as she fell onto the bed and wept loudly into her pillow. She tried to block out all of the negative thoughts that were going through her head and shouted aloud, “I have to get these things out of my mind! I can’t sleep with them in there anymore!”

She lay on the bed sobbing as she thought about her dreams. Then, she gradually started to calm herself down and fell into a restless sleep. In her dream, she saw a man who appeared to be walking through the town square. She suddenly realized that it was in fact the same man that she had seen in her visions.

The man walked through the town square with a grim look on his face as he passed by the statue of Lord Byron on his way down to the river. He walked right past the town hall and into a small alleyway that led to the back of the shops.

At this point in the dream, Julia started moving towards the town square. She followed after the tall, dark-haired man. The man walked along a small wooden bridge that ran over the river and down into town. The path led right through the center of town and into what appeared to be an old, abandoned building. It was covered in ivy and moss and looked to be on the verge of collapse. The bricks were cracked and peeling away from the walls of it, but one could still see faint outlines of pictures on the wall.

The town square at night.

Julia moved to the edge of the town square and looked down into the alleyway below her. She could see dim lights dancing around in the dark and hear distant sounds of people talking and laughing. She moved to look around the town square, but there was no sign of the townspeople.

Just then a small, dark-haired girl walked out from one of the shops on the town square wearing a white nightgown and holding a lantern over her head to light her way. She carried herself with an air of confidence as she walked down the steps  into the darkened town square.

When Julia realized that she had been seen, she ran away from the dark-haired girl and into the dark building. She looked around for something to defend herself with. The only thing she could see before her was a hammer hanging on the wall in front of her. It was so dirty and worn that it looked like it had been there since the building had last been used.

As Julia turned to go back out into the town square, she heard footsteps behind her and turned around to see who was coming. When she did, something jabbed her in the back and knocked her to the ground. Before she could get up, someone was kneeling on top of her pinning her down. She wrapped her arms around the person’s legs and tried to kick them off of her, but she couldn’t free herself from the grip on her arms.

The figure on top of her was Timothy Jenks. Timothy looked down at Julia and smiled mockingly. “So, you decided to come back out after all?” he asked triumphantly. Julia stared at him blankly for a moment, but then suddenly a look of realization flashed across her face.

Julia was suddenly overcome with a feeling of rage, and she swung her fists around wildly while trying to kick Timothy at the same time. Suddenly, Tim let go of her and jumped away from her on the ground as if he had been burned. He sat on the ground for a second holding his hand to his cheek, looking into the air. When he looked back down at Julia, there was a look of cold fury in his eyes that she hadn’t seen before.

He took a step towards her and pointed his finger at her in accusation. “You think you can just come into my town and screw with everyone’s minds with these visions? You know they’ve almost killed Karen? And your little sister has been crying herself to sleep for weeks now? You think we’re just going to let you get away with that? You have no idea who you’re messing with. Julia!”

Julia suddenly snapped out of her rage and looked at him in surprise. “What do you mean, what do I mean? What do you think I mean? Do you assume that I am one of your little townspeople who can have its mind changed by some stupid vision?  I came here to tell you the truth about the visions and about what they are doing to my family and to Karen. But I was wrong, you don’t want to know the truth. You never wanted to know the truth, and you never will. You are just a puppet following orders like everyone else in your town.”

At this, she turned around to leave, but she stopped and turned back to face them all. “Let me tell you something about the visions. They are not real! I don’t even know what they mean. I have no idea who is generating them or why  they would want to. But you do not see the horrors that I see. You do not feel the horror as I feel it, and there is no way that I can explain what the visions mean to someone like you. Because someone like me can only understand through experiencing them myself.”

She paused for a moment, and then continued. “Do you know what they look like? Do you know what the pictures that I see look like?”

The townspeople stared at her in surprise, and some started to laugh nervously.

“Don’t worry, I don’t blame you for not knowing what they look like. They are so horrible and full of pain that no one should ever have to see them.”

At this point, Julia looked at Karen Jones and said “I am going to apologize to this woman.”

Julia left the townspeople and walked over to Karen.

“Karen?”

“Yes, Julia?” replied Karen with a stern frown.

“This is the first apology that I have ever given in my life, but I would like to apologize for the pain that I have caused you. I know that you blame me for the visions, and I am sorry.”

Karen was taken aback by Julia’s apology, and she hesitated for a moment before responding.

“Thank you, Julia. I appreciate your apology.”

Julia nodded and turned to walk back to the townspeople. As she did, she heard Timothy Jenks call out to her.

“Julia! Wait!”

Julia stopped and turned to face him.

“Yes, Timothy?”

“I wanted to apologize to you for what happened. I was part of the group that attacked you, and I am sorry. I hope that you can forgive me.”",1
Jenna wakes up in the hospital a week later to find that she is now a vampire.,"and in order for that to happen Jenna needed to spend some time away from the house.

Gregory had already dug up a few of his wife’s dress shirts and pants that were still her size—she was always skinny and had stayed that way her whole life. He knew that he couldn’t get away with taking any of Antonia’s dresses—she would probably kill him if she ever found out about it.

Gregory watched as Jenna put on one of the shirts and then the pants. She looked like some frumpy middle-aged woman going out for the day, but Gregory didn’t think she looked bad in them at all. All he could see was the beautiful young woman underneath all those clothes.

Jenna stared at herself in the mirror with a look of disgust on her face—the shirt had been a little big on her before, but now it looked like it was going to burst at any moment. Her skinny frame looked even skinnier now that she had gained so much weight from not eating for a week. Gregory watched as she pulled the shirt over her head and cringed when she saw how loose it was now. He wanted so badly to take off the shirt and put on somethingelse, but he knew that it wasn’t his place.

Gregory watched as Jenna got up from the mirror and picked up a brush. She started brushing her hair, trying desperately to get it out of her face and straighten it out. Gregory could tell that she was fighting back tears as she did this because he could see one rolling down her cheek and hit the floor when she moved her hand out of her face.

Gregory walked over to where Jenna was standing by the mirror and took her by the elbow, turning her so that they were standing face-to-face. He gently brushed the tear away from Jenna’s face, then kissed it softly and gently before putting his arms around her waist.

Jenna could feel a lump forming in her throat as Gregory continued to hold her, not saying anything, just letting Jenna cry into his chest. She knew that she should be mad at him for bringing her here to kill her, but she couldn’t stay mad at this man who had been so kind to her after what he had done.

As if Gregory could read Jenna’s mind or sense what was going through it, he turned her around so that they were standing with their backs pressed againstthe wall. He gently ran his hands up and down her back and sides, not saying anything and giving Jenna time to calm herself down.

Jenna stopped crying after about a minute or two then took a deep breath. She looked up at the man who was still holding her and smiled softly before kissing him gently on the lips. Gregory kissed back as passionately as he could, wanting to show his love and gratitude to Jenna for the love that she had given him.

After a few minutes of kissing, Gregory pulled away from Jenna and smiled at her again before pulling her into his arms once more. He whispered something in her ear that she couldn’t understand, but she could tell from his expression that it was something loving and not about what he had done to her yet again.

Jenna smiled again as Gregory pulled her into the bedroom where he started taking off his clothes. They made love slowly and lovingly for hours, neither of them wanting it to end.

      ...

 “What is this?” Jenna asked as she looked at herself in the mirror of the small room that she was in. She could see that her hair was very short and now looked almost exactly like Gregory’s. Her skin had a pale, sickly greenish color to it and she could see that the lines of her face had changed as well.

She reached up and touched her nose with one hand and then pulled away from it to look at it. It was no longer straight and a little bumpy where she had broken it in the fall, but even more crooked than before. She touched her cheeks too only to discover that they were covered with tiny red spots of varying sizes. Her finger traced a long scar down her chest to disappear into her shorts, which she quickly pulled down to look at what was underneath them. There were two pinkish-white skinless circles where each of her nipples had been, with thin pink lines of scar tissue connecting them across her chest.

As she watched, one of the pale parts of her hand grew a tiny black nail and then changed into a fingernail. Her hand then turned into a claw as it cracked into the palm of her other hand, which also changed from pale to black.

    ...

 “A monster!” she screamed as she jumped back from the mirror revealing Gregory standing behind her with an amused expression on his face. “You’veturned me into a monster!”

He chuckled and pulled her close to him. “It’s normal to feel that way. I felt the same way when I first turned, but you’ll get used to it. And you won’t be alone for long, either. The others will awaken soon enough and then we can go back to the way things were before things went so horribly wrong.”

Jenna looked at him curiously. “Why didn’t you tell me that this was going to happen? I could have been mentally prepared for it.”

He shook his head sadly. “I couldn’t tell you, Jenna. I knew that if I did you would have fought me on it and tried to get away. You had to be turned against your will in order for your transformation to take hold of you. I know this is hard on you, but I promise that it’ll all be over soon.”

Her heart started pounding in her chest as she began shaking violently and she felt tears running down her face. “What did he do to me? How are we going to get me back? I won’t be a",0
Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"Jenna looked around her. The room was filled with several beds and the odd piece of equipment. There were curtains on most of the windows, but one was wide open and showed a brick wall outside. She looked back at Liam before speaking again. “What’s your name?” asked Jenna.

Liam smiled at that. “My name is Liam Cross, and I promise that I will not hurt you, no matter what anyone else tells you.”

Jenna thought about things for a few more seconds before asking another question. “Does everyone become a vampire? Is that what this is?” asked Jenna.

Liam shook his head. “Most people don’t become vampires, and it is definitely not something that you want to happen to you,” said Liam.

Jenna looked at him curiously before asking a question that she had been thinking about for the last several minutes. “Where am I? How did I get here?” asked Jenna.

Liam stared at her for a moment. “You are in the hospital,” said Liam, answering her second question first. “The police found you in an alley.”

Jenna looked at him to make sure he was telling the truth. She looked at the room around her, and then back at Liam. “Where is everyone else? I don’t see anyone else here,” said Jenna.

Liam smiled for a moment before shaking his head. “You’re the only person here, right now, but the police are looking for other people who might have been with you at the time of your attack that they might have left behind. You were there quite a while before they found you, and you’re very lucky to be alive,” said Liam.

Jenna looked around the room again, and then back at him. “I don’t understand what happened to me, but I feel like it was more than being attacked and left for dead in an alley,” said Jenna.

Liam nodded for a moment before speaking again. “You are right about that, although I don’t know everything about what happened either,” said Liam. He pulled his jacket out from where he kept it under the chair by his bed, and handed it to  her. “When we meet someone for the first time, as is customary in our kind of society, we give them something small as a token of trust. I hope this isn’t too much for you to carry around with you,” said Liam.

Jenna took the jacket from him and slipped it on. It fit her perfectly, almost as if it was made for her. “No, not at all. Thank you,” said Jenna as she smiled and looked back at him.

He nodded for a few minutes before speaking again. “I want to tell you something else that might answer some questions you have,” said Liam. “When a vampire is about to change, we experience a few events that give us more insight into what is coming. You were probably going through this and may have not realized it, or just forgot about it. When I saw you in the alley, I knew exactly who you were and what had just happened to you,” said Liam as he leaned back more comfortably into his chair.

Jenna leaned forward slightly in her seat as she listened intently to what he was saying. She took a moment to think about what he said and decided to ask him a question as she leaned back in her chair. “In other words, you knew I was going to turn into a vampire,” said Jenna.

Liam looked up at the ceiling for a few seconds, and then looked back at her. “Yes, that is sort of what I’m saying. We all go through this when we are about to change,” he said as he looked back over at the front door.

Jenna shifted her eyes from one side of the room to another as she thought about how Elijah Sedgew ick might take what Liam was saying. She turned to look at the clock on the wall as she realized that it was late, and Elijah would be coming in soon if he wasn’t there already.

She turned away from the clock and back at Liam, who was still watching her carefully. “Where did you say you met each other?” asked Jenna as she shifted her weight in the chair.

“We met on the train to New York,” he said with a slight nod of his head. “I had just gotten on board and sat down in a seat next to you, as I was already quite tired from the trip up from Virginia. When I sat down you turned to look at me, and then took your phone out of your pocket and started typing away.”

Jenna listened as Liam spoke about their first meeting, but was having trouble picturing it in her mind. “Wait a minute,” she said as she looked at the clock and then back at Liam. “Are you saying that I got on this train by myself? When you first walked in here, I thought that I had been taken over by a vampire or something.”

Liam nodded. “Yes, and I know why you would think that. It is one of the things that leads up to a vampire’s transformation. They feel as if they are not traveling alone and have company with them on their journey, but when they look around they realize that no one else is there.”

Jenna nodded her head slowly trying to absorb everything Liam was telling her. “So that’s why I thought there was someone else in here with me?”

He nodded again. “It is possible because you were heading to New York, and I know that Antonia Rossi lives in New York. She is a very powerful vampire. She is the only person right now who holds the allegiance of most of the vampires in this country. She holds sway over a large number of vampires, both here and abroad. Every vampire who has turned to her for protection has been transformed into her kind. You have to go to New York and find her. She will be able to help you.”

Jenna moved away from the door, turning her back on Liam as she slid down until she was sitting on the floor in front of one of the seats. “New York ? What about Liam? I thought he was going with me.”

He shook his head solemnly. “I wish that I could, Jenna, but I can’t. Antonia is very powerful and has vast connections to all sorts of dark forces. If she finds out about me, then they will know that I am here. There wouldn’t be any point in traveling to NYC and going to her if she finds out that I am here. She would come looking for me immediately and, in the process, she would kill you.”

Jenna closed her eyes as she sighed heavily with resignation. “What’s the connection between Damian Henchman and Antonia? Why is he important to her?”

Liam looked at Jenna with a solemn expression as he said, “Damian is a vampire who has been to Italy recently. I think that you should go to Italy and find out if there are any clues to help you about your attacker. You could try New York first, but I think that it would be better if you went to Italy because it is less far away. Plus, it is closer to home for you",1
"When Natalie arrives at the address Trevor gave her, she quickly realizes that something isn't right and that Trevor might be a dangerous man .","head to toe.
“Hi.” Trevor said, smiling at Natalie again. “You look even more beautiful than your pictures. I really hope you like them, because I spent a lot of time choosing them.”
He walked over to the only available table and pulled out a chair for Natalie. There were three other chairs at the table, and Natalie could see that Trevor was sitting next to a young woman who was holding an infant. Natalie sat down in the other middle seat so that she could put some distance between herself and Trevor Lockwood. He didn’t seem to notice this awkward gesture, however, because his attention was fixed on her as soon as she sat down.
“Are you hungry?” he asked her. Natalie nodded and pointed at the menu above the counter. Trevor looked at it for a moment before ordering her an almond croissant with coffee, and then he thanked the cashier by name. Natalie glanced around the room again to see if anyone else was paying attention to them, because she had never been in a restaurant that served so much wine before.
When the cashier smiled at Trevor and nodded at him, Natalie thought about asking if she knew Trevor very well, but she didn’t want to look nosy. She tried to imagine the sort of relationship a person could have with someone who worked at this restaurant, but she couldn’t come up with anything.
When the food arrived, Trevor turned his attention away from Natalie again and began eating his lunch. He chatted with the woman holding the baby and occasionally turned to Natalie every few minutes to ask her how her food was. It was obvious that he had been here many times before, because he didn’t have to take more than a few bites from any of his meals before putting them down and pushing the plates towards the center of the table.
Natalie finished her meal rather quickly because she was nervous, and then she asked for dessert when Trevor was not looking. He told her that it wasn’t polite to ask for dessert until after one finishes their main meal, but Natalie insisted that she was on vacation and needed to treat herself. Trevor and the woman with the baby exchanged a brief glance before Trevor nodded in agreement.
The woman paid for her food while the two men sat at the table together. She had long brown hair tied up in a bun, and she was dressed in a tight red sweater that showed off her cleavage. When she handedTrevor the bill, he paid her with a fifty-dollar bill and then pocketed the change. The woman smiled at Trevor, and she said something that made him laugh as she walked out of the restaurant. Natalie hoped that Trevor wouldn’t offer to pay for her meal, because she wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.
Shortly after the woman left, Trevor got up and walked to the window. Natalie noticed how handsome he looked when he turned around, and she was glad that none of her friends were with her so that they wouldn’t make fun of her for being attracted to him.
Trevor turned around suddenly to ask Natalie if it was time for the check yet, but he quickly turned away again when he saw that she was still finishing her dessert. As they were leaving, Natalie tried not to look at any of the other customers in the restaurant for fear that they would recognize her from high school or college.
It took Natalie a minute to remember his address after he told her where it was. On the way there, Trevor talked about all of his favorite foods and places to eat in New York City. By the time they arrived at his building’s lobby, Natalie could tell that he had become bored withtalking about himself.
When Trevor held the door open for her, Natalie had a brief fantasy of him taking her out to dinner and paying for it with his credit card. After getting lost twice and ending up in Times Square, Natalie tried to look at everything as if she were on vacation. When they finally arrived at Trevor’s building, Natalie reached into her purse for the cash that she had brought with her so that she could give it to Trevor in exchange for phone sex.
Trevor unlocked his apartment door and they walked into a small foyer with beige carpeting, a doorman booth, and several mailboxes. Natalie started to turn around, but Trevor pushed her past the mailboxes and headed up a flight of stairs while turning on lights along the way. At the top of the stairs, Trevor showed her another flight of stairs that led to his apartment, but she said that she wanted to go back down because she wasn’t interested in going any farther. Trevor asked her if she wanted to see some pictures of his family instead.
When Natalie told him that she didn’t care about his family, he started telling her all about himself instead. When she told him that she wasn’t interested in reading what hewrote, he stood up and took her by the hand. Natalie could tell he was taller than her by at least six inches. He told Natalie that she didn’t need to be so cold toward him because he was just trying to give her $100 for talking and listening to him on the phone. Still holding her hand, Trevor led Natalie into a dark bedroom with a black leather couch and one white wall that held a large painting. When he asked her if it was good enough for him to get naked on, she shook her head no and pulled her hand out of his.
Trevor took off his jacket and shirt, and he turned around slowly while opening his belt so that Natalie could get a good look at him as he took off his jeans. As soon as Natalie saw the small tattoo on Trevor’s left butt cheek, she realized that this was not going to be an easy way to get $100. Trevor put his wallet down on the table and began taking off his underwear. Natalie stood up and went back down the stairs without saying anything.
When she arrived at the bottom of the stairs, she tried to think of an excuse for leaving so that Trevor wouldn’t be able to follow her outside and try anything. Natalie told",0
"Natalie Harper makes a deal with Trevor Lockwood, a man she met online, to meet him in person in exchange for money so that she can pay her rent .","Natalie Harper hated living at home. But with the economy tanking and her teaching job being cut, there was no other option for her. She had no idea how she was going to make it through the next two years until she finished her teaching degree.
   Natalie often felt like a failure. She had dropped out of high school at eighteen, moved to New York City, and then come back to the suburbs of Westport to live with her mom and dad. Natalie knew that she had been given a golden opportunity by her parents, but she couldn’t help feeling that it had all been wasted.
   She had always dreamed of becoming a writer, but after spending so much time working two jobs to make ends meet, she had never found the time to write anything other than grocery lists.
   Natalie thought that things were going well in her life. She was twenty-two and still young enough to go after what she wanted. But she knew that something was missing—romance in her life. At least that’s what she told herself every night in bed as she stared at the ceiling.
   And since being out of school for nearly three years, Natalie had found herself not meeting any eligible men.There were times when she thought about dating a man her own age, but it never seemed to work out.
   So after talking to some of her girlfriends about how they could make sure they were always meeting someone new, Natalie had decided that she needed to do something wild and crazy, something that would get her noticed and make her stand out from the rest of the women in Westport. One of her friends suggested speed dating, but Natalie didn’t want to do it because she couldn’t imagine getting set up on a date with someone and then having to leave after only twenty minutes.
   Another friend suggested going to a bar and trying to pick up a drunk guy; the problem with that was that she wouldn’t know what she wanted until morning.
   Her other friend hadn’t seen a single available guy in Westport since graduating from college six years ago, and she was convinced that everyone outside of Westport was either gay or married.
   After spending several days trying to figure out what she should do, Natalie decided that the only way to meet someone new would be on her own.
   And after finding people from all over the world on her favorite site for online dating, Natalie knewexactly what she wanted to do. She had talked to a few people through the site, and they had all said that online dating was where it was at. She searched through dozens of profiles of men who were interested in meeting someone new, and she finally decided that she wanted to meet Trevor Lockwood, a 27-year-old advertising executive who lived in New York City. Trevor had sent her several messages online, and she had found his profile intriguing. She knew that he was looking for a woman who wasn’t afraid of a bit of adventure, and she also knew that he hated it when people lied. And Natalie Harper hated being dishonest even more than she loved the idea of meeting a guy from New York City. After receiving a request from Trevor to speak with him on the phone, Natalie agreed to do so because it was finally a chance for her to be honest with someone who might actually get to know her. They talked about everything from their favorite movies and books to their careers and their expectations about dating. When they ended the phone call, Natalie had felt hopeful for the first time in a long time. She understood that there was no guarantee that Trevor wouldn’t turn out to be ajerk, but she also knew that she had to at least give him a chance. However, she didn’t have enough money to travel to New York City for an in-person interview, so she was willing to agree to almost anything that he might ask for. Her monthly rent was more than twice what the average student earned, and she didn’t know what she would do if she couldn’t bring in some additional income. Trevor agreed to pay her $100 for a twenty-minute phone call, so Natalie spent the next few days planning what she would say during their conversation. She figured that since he probably lived in New York, she should bring up some places that she had visited or where she thought that they should go on a date. She didn’t want to waste their twenty minutes babbling about unimportant things like what kind of cereal he liked or how many siblings he had. Still, she also didn’t want to overwhelm him with information about her life and how awesome it was, so she practiced talking about why she wanted to meet someone new—and why he should meet her. Natalie arrived at the coffee shop on West 11th Street fifteen minutes early. After looking around for a few minutes, she spotted a guywho was fiddling with his phone and tried to remember why she had chosen that particular place. The interior of the building made her feel even more anxious about the upcoming conversation, because it was so different from any other coffee shop that she had ever been in. The walls were painted with bright colors, and the furnishings looked like they had all been custom-made. She didn’t recognize any of the students in the cafe—all of them were young and fashionable, and none of them seemed to be drinking coffee or eating pastries. As a result, Natalie was certain that there wasn’t anyone else in the shop who was there to meet someone like her.
When a door across the room opened, Natalie turned around and gasped when she saw Trevor Lockwood striding toward her with a warm smile on his face. He was carrying his phone in one hand and looked like he had just gotten off work, because he was wearing a white button-down shirt and black pants. He had short brown hair that looked as if it hadn’t been combed in a while, and he was wearing black designer glasses. She held out her hand and tried not to look nervous as he shook it, but she couldn’t stop shivering from",0
"Shannon meets Luke, a young man who helps her with her second book.","of Shannon.
Shannon thought that was sweet but wondered what he meant by it and hoped it wasn’t more pressure for them to get married. Charlie promised that even if they didn’t get married, Shannon wouldn’t be alone without him because he would always do what he could to care for her and make sure she was happy. She smiled and got out of the car to go inside.

 
When Shannon returned home, she found Luke watching one of her favorite movies. She thanked him for coming over and apologized again for not being able to meet with him. She explained that after everything that had happened with her father she needed time alone and she felt silly for getting upset about it. Luke told her not to apologize, especially since he only really wanted to watch the movie anyway. They both started watching the movie while Shannon explained that if people really knew how she struggled with writing every day, they would tell her that she was crazy to do it. He told her that he didn’t think she was crazy and everyone had struggles in life but most people didn’t talk about them because they thought it made them look weak. Shannon assured him that she wasn’t weak and told Luke how much she admired his work. He told her how he had been working on a play and was going to send it to one of the directors downtown when he was finished. She then told him about her novel and all of her hopes for it with Sam Shaw, who thought the novel was incredible, at a meeting that night. Luke thought that was cool and told her about his play again before asking her what she wanted to do after meeting with Sam Shaw in the city. Shannon responded by telling him about NYU.

 
As they talked more, Luke told her more about himself, including the fact that he wrote plays and screenplays. He explained that many of the stories he wanted to tell were too expensive for movies or TV but that didn’t stop him from trying to get a story out there because he believed in what he was doing. He said, “And I’m not going to stop fighting for it.” Shannon was inspired by his determination and asked him if he could help her with her second book. He said she could count on him and he looked forward to helping her reach her dreams.

 
Shannon felt closer to Luke as they talked and she wanted to see what he looked like when he was working, so she asked him if they coulddo it together. He said that he was working on something at his house and that he had two hours until his mom got home and asked her if she could give him a hand. Shannon said yes and told him that Abby had left a message saying she would be over in an hour. Luke said that they should get started on her book in the meantime, so Shannon got up to go to his house.

 
Shannon’s head was spinning for the rest of the day because of all she had done and now she was going to go hang out with someone who lived across town. She didn’t know how Luke found her, but she couldn’t deny that he felt familiar in a way that made her feel safe. Her mom had always told her to stay away from boys, but no one ever told her why or how it could hurt them when they were older. She was twenty-two years old, though, and she never thought that someone couldn’t be trusted. It was always up to the individual. Luke didn’t set off any alarms in Shannon because she believed that no matter what happened, it was going to be okay and everything would work out the way it should.Shannon got in a cab and tried to relax as the driver drove her to Luke’s house. She had never been to his neighborhood before and she felt a little nervous because he lived so far away. The cab pulled up outside of an apartment building where Luke said he lived, which was weird for a person in their early twenties to not own or rent a house yet.

 
He was waiting for her outside when she got out of the cab, and they walked up the stairs together. Shannon noticed that he seemed embarrassed by his living situation and he told her that his mother bought the apartment building to rent out so she could have some extra income. He didn’t live at home anymore because there wasn’t enough room, but he said that as long as he lived close by, it was fine with his mom because it would make him more responsible.

 
They walked into the apartment building and up a dark flight of stairs until Luke finally stopped in front of an apartment. He unlocked the door, and Shannon took off her shoes when they went inside. They were in a big studio apartment with one window that looked out onto a courtyard below it where there were some other apartments. Luke had one whole wall covered with bookshelves and he had a record player on his table in the corner, along with a few records.

 
Shannon thought that he was cute and she tried to imagine herself as a single woman living in the apartment above Luke. She imagined coming home every night to an apartment decorated like Luke’s except with flowers instead of books and records. She imagined cooking dinner for herself and her imaginary husband before they would go to bed and make love. Shannon wondered if it was normal for girls her age to fantasize about getting married and having kids.

 
She shook herself out of her fantasy as Luke opened his laptop and started working on Shannon’s novel for the next few hours while she did nothing but lie in bed. Shannon couldn’t help but feel a little jealous because she wanted to be the one sitting at the computer writing a bestselling novel, but instead she was just lying in bed.

 
Luke finally stopped working and they sat down at his table for dinner, which consisted of a takeout pizza and a bottle of wine that he bought from the corner store. Shannon wondered if he was trying to impress her or if he always ate pizza for dinner with his friends. She decided it was probably normal, because who wants to eat",1
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"got sick several years ago and eventually died from cancer. Before she passed away, Jeff promised her that he would take care of Shannon after she was gone.

Jeff makes sure to tell Shannon that he is always there for her and that she can talk to him about anything at all. He tells her that he has talked with her mother a few times since she passed away, and they have even painted together. Shannon seems a bit skeptical at first but eventually decides to give it a try.

Shannon likes the idea of having an imaginary friend to talk with, because it makes her feel closer to her mom even though she isn’t able to see her anymore. She also enjoys being able to talk about the fun things in life with her imaginary friend too, because it helps bring back some of the memories that she had before.

Jeff explains to Shannon that things happen for a reason, and he encourages her to look at the good things instead of focusing on all of the bad ones. He tells her that there’s nothing wrong with remembering the good times, and he even suggests that they talk about them more often.

Shannon says yes because she knows this will help improve her mood. She also really likes painting with Jeff, becauseit allows her to express herself and have a sense of control over her life again. She even talks to Jeff’s imaginary friend, and he has many different stories that she can talk about with him. 

It turns out that Mrs. Jacobs has been listening to their whole conversation the whole time. She is impressed by how much Shannon has grown over the past few months, and she admires how brave she has been in dealing with her grief. Mrs. Jacobs has also been listening in on Shannon’s conversations with Jeff’s imaginary friend too, and she asks to come along the next time they have a conversation. She says that she has always wanted to meet him because he sounds so interesting. Mrs. Jacobs explains that she has been teaching art for years in different schools around town, and she has been having trouble coming up with a new topic for her painting class because painters tend to focus on sad things rather than happy ones. She tries not to think about it too much when she paints, but it’s still hard for her not to get stuck in the same subject matter all the time.

Shannon thinks this is an excellent idea, and they decide topaint a picture of what each one of them would like to see on Main Street in the future. Mrs. Jacobs says that they don’t have to do anything too fancy, just something that will inspire them to work hard and build a better future for themselves and their community. Shannon starts by making a picture of how she wants Main Street to look with her uncle Jeff one night after they eat dinner at Susan’s restaurant, and she tries to include everyone that has been helping her through her tough times. At first, everyone is really excited about the project, especially when they see that Shannon has put their ideas on paper. Then Shannon doesn’t feel as passionate about the project anymore after she sees how upset everyone gets when she adds another person to her sketch, a person who hasn’t even helped her yet. Everyone starts fighting about why she would ever include this person, and they can’t stop arguing with each other. Jeff makes it seem like there are only two possible options: either he or the other person can be in the picture, and no one else can be on Main Street. So Shannon has to start over again with a new sketch that doesn’t make everyone as mad. It takes her a long time before shefeels like she can finish the painting, but when she does, it is really pretty.

	 	Jeff says that Shannon should call it “Main Street in the Future,” and he tells her that they could probably put it on display somewhere to help raise money for something important like building a new park in town. Shannon paints another picture for Mrs. Jacobs and Missy Walters of how they want Main Street in the future to look like, this time excluding all of the people who are fighting with each other. Mrs. Jacobs says that this is exactly what she wanted to see, and they should add some buildings too because Main Street will look even better once it has places where people can buy things to wear or places where people can go to work.

	When Mrs. Jacobs leaves, Shannon hears her talking with her husband and she asks him for some help with something important to do soon. She tells him that he shouldn’t worry about it because Mr. Jacobs is really excited about what they are going to do, and he didn’t have anything else that he needed to do right away because the workmen are finished with whatever it was that they were doing at the house.

	Shannon falls asleep trying to figure out what sheis supposed to do, and when she wakes up, her daddy is sitting beside her in bed looking worried. She asks him if he is okay, and he says that he’s been thinking about the same thing that she has been thinking about, which is why they are only one week away from launching a prototype of their new satellite. He says that there has to be some way for Shannon to help him launch the satellite so that she will feel like she is helping her mother get better, but he knows that his heart just can’t let go of his project and allow Shannon to take over. Just then, her daddy starts coughing and choking on his own mucus before he falls over onto Shannon’s nightstand because his lungs just aren’t able to hold any air anymore.

	Shannon wakes up the next morning at 6 o’clock in the morning with her head inside of a glass of water and her mouth full of food, an apple this time, instead of a whole chicken. Mr. Jacobs is sitting on the other side of her bed looking very tired and worried, but he tells Shannon that she is very lucky because she is still very young and she has a lot of things left to paint. She starts working on",0
The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"After that, I just need you to focus on getting better now.”

Lisa stood up at this point and walked into the other room to collect Daisy’s notebook. She returned to her chair and opened up the notebook. The first few pages were dedicated to instructions on how their family was going to take care of things while she was away, and the last few pages contained some words of wisdom that she wanted her children to read after they got over the initial shock of her passing.

Just before she started reading, Lisa stopped and held the notebook up for a moment, considering her words. “You know, maybe I shouldn’t read this part of the notebook to them.”

“Oh? Why not?”

“It might be too much to handle at one time. It might be too much for them to process all at once.”

Lisa stopped to consider that point for a moment, then looked up at Daisy. “Can I just tell them some things right now, and read the rest of the words later?”

“Of course. Whatever you think is best for your children. But there are some things that I have written down that I would like them to hear before I pass on.”

Lisa nodded her head and settled back into her chair. “Okay, well first, they should know that you wrote about how proud you were of them. Both the way they have dealt with this so far, and the way they have taken care of everything at home while I’m at the hospital with you. You talked a lot about how much confidence you had in them to do the job, even when I wasn’t here. You said that you thought Lisa was ready to handle almost everything, and that she was ready to take over the business if she ever had to. And you were also very proud of both of them for all their hard work in school. You said that you had a good feeling about the direction they were headed.” Lisa paused at this point, but she could see in Daisy’s eyes that she was still fully awake and listening. “I’m not sure when they should know about the other parts, though,” she continued. “You talked about some important things that will affect them when I’m gone. There were things that we need to talk about as a family. ”

At this point, Daisy’s eyelids began to flutter a little bit and she gasped for air. Lisa looked over at the nurse at the desk and made some hand gestures, which got her attention. The nurse came over and checked Daisy’s vital signs before looking back at Lisa and nodding. “It’s probably just a side effect from these injections,” she explained. “She might need some oxygen for a few minutes, but she should be fine. Give her a second to rest and then try to talk again.”

Lisa nodded and put the side of her hand on Daisy’s forehead to check her temperature. “I should have brought your hat,” she said as she thought about what else might be troubling Daisy.

“Is it going to be all right?” Daisy asked in a groggy voice. “Are you going to be there when everything happens?”

Lisa tried to speak through her own nervousness. “Of course I will be there,” she assured Daisy and then moved closer to listen as the nurse explained what was happening. “I think you might be getting a little bit of a fever,” she said as she took Daisy’s pulse. “They just need to give you some oxygen and we should be on our way again soon. You have been such a trooper,” the nurse continued before turning to Lisa and adding, “You’ve been doing a terrific job of taking care of her. She’s got a great family. I know she will be fine.”

Lisa tried to control her breathing and nodded in response. “As soon as they give you the okay, I’ll go sit with my mom in the waiting room. She’s already told me all the things she wanted me to know if something happened,” she said before the nurse could interrupt.

Daisy opened her eyes and slowly turned her head toward Lisa. “Thank you for being there for all of us today,” she said. “I know it hasn’t been easy for you, but if there is any way I can repay you someday, just let me know.”

Lisa reached out a hand and brought it to her lips in response. “I don’t want to talk  about that just yet. I just want to get through today and see how things look in the morning. After we talk to the doctor tomorrow, I’ll have a better idea of what we need to do after you leave here.”

When Lisa turned back toward Daisy, her eyes were filled with tears. The nurse stepped up beside them and wiped her hand on a tissue before reaching out to touch Daisy’s arm.

“Mrs. Mayberry, I think your daughter is worn out and needs to go home for a little while before coming back this evening. She has been such a help today and really been an inspiration to many of the other patients. I know she is a special person, but her strength today has been so uplifting to everyone here.”

Daisy nodded in agreement as the nurse spoke. “I think she should go home too. She gets up early every day, comes to take care of me, and then gets back here before dark to do whatever I need her to do. If you don’t mind, I would like her to stay here with me tonight. I want us to talk for a while before she goes home.”

Lisa glanced over at her and smiled weakly, but it was obvious that the emotional strain from the day was now starting to show. As they stood up and started walking toward the door, Lisa reached out and squeezed her mom’s hand. “I know you are tired, but I’m glad you are staying here tonight. I really want to talk about this afternoon and what happened in my office.”

“Me too,” Daisy said as she squeezed her hand back. “I think you should get some rest though because I want to tell you all about it while it is still fresh in my mind.”

They both smiled at one another as they walked out of the room and started down the hall toward Lisa’s office. There was a sudden explosion of activity around them as nurses and doctors scurried to and fro with charts, medicine carts, equipment, and other assorted paraphernalia. However, the commotion abruptly ended as they entered the hallway and walked by without a glance at them.

In the quiet of the hallway, they made their way down to Lisa’s office and took seats across from each other on her sofa. “Okay,  tell me everything you know about this trial,” Lisa said as she picked up her laptop and began turning it on.

Daisy sighed heavily as she sat back in the love seat and pulled her feet up underneath her. She pulled both hands through her hair in frustration, and then started talking. “I really don’t know much about it except that the doctor said it is an experimental treatment for people with the particular type of lung cancer I have. He told me that he was sending me to Memorial Hospital in St. Louis for an evaluation before I could be enrolled in the trial. He said he had been contacted by a research committee at the hospital and that they would meet me and evaluate me. I’m supposed to leave tomorrow at noon,” she said as she leaned back and covered her eyes with her hand.

Lisa sat behind her desk and folded her hands in front of her. “That’s great news! It will be such a relief to have you out of the house and somewhere where I can drop by whenever I need to. You’ve become too difficult to deal with lately,” she said. She quickly added, “I don’t mean that as an insult.”

Daisy looked at Lisa and smiled. “I know you didn’t mean it as an insult. I have been difficult to deal with lately, but maybe now that I am leaving for a while it will give you some rest and you won’t feel so overwhelmed. Maybe it will also relieve Bill of some of the stress he’s been under,” she said. They both sat silently for a moment before Daisy continued, “I think this could be the answer to our problems. I could come through this and we wouldn’t have to worry so much about where the money is going to come from. We could be financially secure again. And, as we used to say in school…it will be like having found the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.”

“I agree,” said Lisa. She then added, “But what about me? How do I know that you’re going to come through this and be fine? What if it doesn’t work out and you die anyway? How can I go on living without you? You’re all I have. Who is going to take care of me",1
Shannon's paintings help her to deal with her grief and to find a new sense of purpose.,"had been ill for a long time and they didn’t have much money so Shannon never got to go do things with her friends like go out for ice cream or get a treat from the candy store. People would always ask her if she wanted to come along with them, but she was too sad because she didn’t feel like herself anymore. At first, Shannon only painted a few trees and then more buildings, but one day she went down to the creek near their house and saw how beautiful nature was. She had always thought that nature was boring compared to watching TV, but after going to the creek one day, she realized that there could be beauty in something so simple as a tiny stream of water flowing from one pool of water into another. It made her realize how much more there was to life than just being sad about how much things had changed in the last few years.

As Shannon continued painting the creek and other parts of nature, she realized that people were missing out on so much because they weren’t taking time to see all of the beauty that was around them. It is important for everyone to learn how to live in a better way, with less energy usage and more respect for nature. She painted the beautiful flowers that grew alongthe small creek she had found and was amazed by the beauty of nature. She asked Mr. Jacobs to give her permission to paint a picture of Main Street in the future, but Mr. Jacobs told her that she needed to wait until they were approved to travel back in time before she could do something like that.

As time passed, Shannon learned how to paint better and better and became an even stronger inspiration for people who loved art. She also learned that her mother’s advice about being creative about her own education was still good, since she had never learned about all of history and so many different things in school. Her paintings became quite popular as people saw how much beauty and emotion she put into each one. Mr. Jacobs allowed her to paint a portrait of Main Street after he learned her intentions were pure and not for some kind of personal gain.

Shannon’s work became so popular that the city decided to display one of her paintings prominently in front of the museum where it would be seen by anyone who entered the town from the Old Highway 18 bridge. The picture she painted was called “Future Main Street” and showed an idyllic street scene showing all of the great things yet to come. The sign above the painting read“Shannon Daniel’s Future Main Street” in large letters. When they unveiled the painting, many dignitaries came from nearby cities to see it and congratulate Shannon on her talent. It was a day that would stay with Shannon for the rest of her life, and she could not have been more proud of herself.

Now that Shannon was moving past her difficult childhood, Rosemary began focusing on ways to start building their lives together and making a home for themselves. Although Shannon sometimes felt bad about asking for so much help, she knew she could not have made it without Rosemary and her family’s love and support. She also realized that this would be her last chance to grow up with Rosemary, so they decided it was time for them to move out of their grandma’s house and get their own place. They found an affordable apartment on the edge of town and moved in together, where they could be close to work and school while having a bit more independence than they had at grandma’s house.

Shannon never forgot what her mother had told her about being creative with her education, so she decided that she wanted to learn more about art history. She asked Mr. Jacobs if he could help her bysetting up a meeting with one of his friends, who was a curator at the art museum. They made plans to meet in the morning, and Shannon read every book on the subject that she could lay her hands on.

When they met, Shannon told him about the work she was doing and he was impressed by her knowledge. He offered to send her any information or resources that she needed and showed interest in some of the work she had been doing. He also let Shannon know that someone from the museum would be coming into town in two weeks and asked if she would like to meet with them as well. Shannon felt proud of herself, that her hard work was paying off, when Mr. Jacobs introduced her to the curator. They talked for quite a while and Shannon learned a great deal from him about how he built his career and how other artists use their creativity to express their feelings.

When Rosemary got home from work, Shannon told her everything about what had happened that day and how much she had learned. Rosemary was so proud of the person that Shannon was becoming and encouraged her to keep following her passion. Shannon knew that Rosemary would always support her and help make her dreams come true.

    ‘Well done, my girl,’ said Rosemary.
    Shannon smiled at her and then went to get something to eat.

   The next few weeks went by quickly as Shannon prepared for the big opening night. Her paintings had become very popular and she was working hard at finding time to paint while still completing her homework.

Shannon knew that there would be a lot of people in attendance on opening night because this was an opportunity for people from all over to experience the art of a young artist from their home town. She painted until late into the night and went to bed feeling nervous at the prospect of all eyes being on her.

When she woke up in the morning, Shannon started feeling very sick and ended up missing school that day as she recuperated in bed. She was sure that she had caught a cold or something and didn’t think it would affect the opening night too much.

  No one noticed that Shannon was not at the opening night because they were all too busy talking about her paintings. One of her friends picked up a newspaper and read a positive review about her work which caused quite a stir among the other attendees.

Shannon’s mom, Rosemary, was sitting in the audience with tears running down her face as she watched Shannon take her bows. It was clear to everyone that Shannon had found her calling in life and Rosemary was very proud of her.",0
Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"Jenna looked around her. The room was filled with several beds and the odd piece of equipment. There were curtains on most of the windows, but one was wide open and showed a brick wall outside. She looked back at Liam before speaking again. “What’s your name?” asked Jenna.

Liam smiled at that. “My name is Liam Cross, and I promise that I will not hurt you, no matter what anyone else tells you.”

Jenna thought about things for a few more seconds before asking another question. “Does everyone become a vampire? Is that what this is?” asked Jenna.

Liam shook his head. “Most people don’t become vampires, and it is definitely not something that you want to happen to you,” said Liam.

Jenna looked at him curiously before asking a question that she had been thinking about for the last several minutes. “Where am I? How did I get here?” asked Jenna.

Liam stared at her for a moment. “You are in the hospital,” said Liam, answering her second question first. “The police found you in an alley.”

Jenna looked at him to make sure he was telling the truth. She looked at the room around her, and then back at Liam. “Where is everyone else? I don’t see anyone else here,” said Jenna.

Liam smiled for a moment before shaking his head. “You’re the only person here, right now, but the police are looking for other people who might have been with you at the time of your attack that they might have left behind. You were there quite a while before they found you, and you’re very lucky to be alive,” said Liam.

Jenna looked around the room again, and then back at him. “I don’t understand what happened to me, but I feel like it was more than being attacked and left for dead in an alley,” said Jenna.

Liam nodded for a moment before speaking again. “You are right about that, although I don’t know everything about what happened either,” said Liam. He pulled his jacket out from where he kept it under the chair by his bed, and handed it to  her. “When we meet someone for the first time, as is customary in our kind of society, we give them something small as a token of trust. I hope this isn’t too much for you to carry around with you,” said Liam.

Jenna took the jacket from him and slipped it on. It fit her perfectly, almost as if it was made for her. “No, not at all. Thank you,” said Jenna as she smiled and looked back at him.

He nodded for a few minutes before speaking again. “I want to tell you something else that might answer some questions you have,” said Liam. “When a vampire is about to change, we experience a few events that give us more insight into what is coming. You were probably going through this and may have not realized it, or just forgot about it. When I saw you in the alley, I knew exactly who you were and what had just happened to you,” said Liam as he leaned back more comfortably into his chair.

Jenna leaned forward slightly in her seat as she listened intently to what he was saying. She took a moment to think about what he said and decided to ask him a question as she leaned back in her chair. “In other words, you knew I was going to turn into a vampire,” said Jenna.

Liam looked up at the ceiling for a few seconds, and then looked back at her. “Yes, that is sort of what I’m saying. We all go through this when we are about to change,” he said as he looked back over at the front door.

Jenna shifted her eyes from one side of the room to another as she thought about how Elijah Sedgew ick might take what Liam was saying. She turned to look at the clock on the wall as she realized that it was late, and Elijah would be coming in soon if he wasn’t there already.

She turned away from the clock and back at Liam, who was still watching her carefully. “Where did you say you met each other?” asked Jenna as she shifted her weight in the chair.

“We met on the train to New York,” he said with a slight nod of his head. “I had just gotten on board and sat down in a seat next to you, as I was already quite tired from the trip up from Virginia. When I sat down you turned to look at me, and then took your phone out of your pocket and started typing away.”

Jenna listened as Liam spoke about their first meeting, but was having trouble picturing it in her mind. “Wait a minute,” she said as she looked at the clock and then back at Liam. “Are you saying that I got on this train by myself? When you first walked in here, I thought that I had been taken over by a vampire or something.”

Liam nodded. “Yes, and I know why you would think that. It is one of the things that leads up to a vampire’s transformation. They feel as if they are not traveling alone and have company with them on their journey, but when they look around they realize that no one else is there.”

Jenna nodded her head slowly trying to absorb everything Liam was telling her. “So that’s why I thought there was someone else in here with me?”

He nodded again. “It is possible because you were heading to New York, and I know that Antonia Rossi lives in New York. She is a very powerful vampire. She is the only person right now who holds the allegiance of most of the vampires in this country. She holds sway over a large number of vampires, both here and abroad. Every vampire who has turned to her for protection has been transformed into her kind. You have to go to New York and find her. She will be able to help you.”

Jenna moved away from the door, turning her back on Liam as she slid down until she was sitting on the floor in front of one of the seats. “New York ? What about Liam? I thought he was going with me.”

He shook his head solemnly. “I wish that I could, Jenna, but I can’t. Antonia is very powerful and has vast connections to all sorts of dark forces. If she finds out about me, then they will know that I am here. There wouldn’t be any point in traveling to NYC and going to her if she finds out that I am here. She would come looking for me immediately and, in the process, she would kill you.”

Jenna closed her eyes as she sighed heavily with resignation. “What’s the connection between Damian Henchman and Antonia? Why is he important to her?”

Liam looked at Jenna with a solemn expression as he said, “Damian is a vampire who has been to Italy recently. I think that you should go to Italy and find out if there are any clues to help you about your attacker. You could try New York first, but I think that it would be better if you went to Italy because it is less far away. Plus, it is closer to home for you",1
The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,". “Just stay in the hall!”

Tim was frozen with fear and confusion. “What are you doing?” he asked quietly.

Julia took a deep breath and turned to Thelma. “Please get me out of here,” she said with difficulty, her voice barely audible. “I think that I’m going to be sick.”

Thelma nodded and reached for the door, but a loud crashing noise made her freeze in her tracks. Julia had turned around and saw the large dark figures moving towards them. It did not quite look like they were moving, but more like they were flowing. Then the other door opened and the little girl came walking slowly into the room.

“I am here with your doctor,” she said calmly and smiled at Julia. “He says that he will be able to help you relax and get your thoughts and feelings in order.”

Thelma moved quickly to the girl’s side and forced her back out of the door. She turned around to face the doctor.

“What are you doing here? Why are you treating my daughter this way? Why can’t I come in there with her?”

The doctor looked around the room, as if searching for an answer. He found none and started to move towards the door. “I need to talk to the patient alone, Mrs. Bates. Please wait in the hallway and out of sight until I call you back in.”

The doctor moved to the door and held it open, but Thelma had moved out of his way. She stood calmly in front of him, blocking his exit.

“No sir. You will not move from this office until you explain your intentions to this young lady and me and our doctor.”

The doctor seemed to stare at her for a full minute before he spoke again. “Are you the patient’s mother?”

She nodded.

“Do you believe your daughter needs medical or psychiatric treatment?”

Thelma moved her head slowly in a nod and waited for the doctor to speak. His voice was very calm and monotone as he replied, “I believe your daughter may need medical treatment, but not psychiatric therapy at this time. I recommend that she be seen at the local hospital , where we can give her medical attention and keep her under sedation until the medication starts to take effect.”

Thelma pulled her body straighter and showed no emotion on her face. “We will provide those services here, Doctor.”

The doctor shook his head slowly. “I cannot recommend that course of action. I believe it would be in the best interest of your daughter for her to be seen by a specialist at the hospital in Raleigh.”

Thelma nodded slowly and lowered her head.  “You will cooperate with us, Doctor. If you don’t, I will have you dismissed from this hospital and never allow you to practice medicine again in this county. I am an officer of the law and know how these matters are handled.”

Timothy Jenks stood and walked swiftly to the door. He opened it and stepped out into the hall. Thelma followed quickly. “Come with me, young lady,” she said as she led Julia out the door.

Thelma walked silently down the corridor and stopped in front of a closed door. They turned to look at Julia. She was trembling on the verge of panic. “Don’t worry, honey. It will be okay,” Thelma said as she entered the room and closed the door behind her. She walked to the bed and sat on the edge beside Julia.

Julia looked up at Thelma and started to cry. “What are they going to do with me, Mama?”

Thelma’s expression changed from one of seething anger to that of a loving mother. She walked slowly to Julia, put her arms around her, and held her close. “Oh, honey. I’m sorry. They are not going to do anything except listen to you and help you get well.”

“They? What do you mean? You mean they will just listen to me talk about this stuff? That’s all? ”

As she spoke, Thelma realized that Julia was thinking of going to a psychiatrist. She was relieved that the town doctor refused to heed Thelma’s request. Now, looking into her daughter’s face, she could see the fear and uncertainty that Julia was facing. “Yes, honey. They will listen to you and—“

Suddenly there was a sound at the door. Thelma turned and saw Karen Jones standing in the doorway of the bedroom. “The doctor wants to talk to you, Dr. Martin. They moved up your appointment.”

Thelma turned back around to face Julia and continued, “They moved up your appointment because I insisted they do so.” She smiled reassuringly at her daughter and then added, “They are going to  help you get well and I am sure everything will be fine.”

Julia hesitated, then asked, “So why are you crying?” Thelma turned away as the tears streamed down her face. Julia looked at Karen for understanding, but she had already gone back into the kitchen.

In the next few minutes, it became clear to Julia that more than one person in town was disturbed by the recent events. First, Julia’s friends avoided her, and when she spoke to them on the telephone they had little to say about anything. Then, one day a group of high school girls came by Julia’s house and began screaming at her.

“You are possessed by the devil! Get out of town! Go away! We don’t want you here anymore! Get out of town or we will kill you!” Julia was taken completely by surprise her and did not know how to react. She began crying uncontrollably.

Thelma came running out of the house with a pan in her hand, screaming at the girls to leave her daughter alone. Thelma then turned her attention back to Julia and said, “Julia, I’m so sorry. Please don’t cry. Just leave when you can and never come back here again. Please stop crying Julia, for my sake if not your own.”

Julia stood outside her house, crying and listening to the screams of the girls moving up the street. Finally, Julia left her house and ran as fast as she could into town. She ran until she could no longer run. She found herself at the town square, collapsed on the grass crying and gasping for air. She was breathing so heavily that it was difficult for her to speak, but Julia managed to say, “I don’t know what’s happening to me. I don’t think I can stay here anymore. Please help me! Please do something! Please make this stop!”

Julia did not know what else to say. She was exhausted and out of breath. Julia felt alone and scared. Julia sat in the town square, surrounded by trees and empty benches, and cried. Julia cried because she was scared, because she felt alone, because she did not know how to fix what was happening to her, and because she just did not want to feel this way",1
Julia finally learns the truth about the visions.,"guilty?”

Julia sobbed as she stumbled back towards her bedroom. She could no longer hold back her tears as she cried, “I know that I was right to stay at home, but now I am scared to go out again! It doesn’t matter how many times you tell me I am safe, I don’t know if you are telling the truth!”

Julia sobbed again as she fell onto the bed and wept loudly into her pillow. She tried to block out all of the negative thoughts that were going through her head and shouted aloud, “I have to get these things out of my mind! I can’t sleep with them in there anymore!”

She lay on the bed sobbing as she thought about her dreams. Then, she gradually started to calm herself down and fell into a restless sleep. In her dream, she saw a man who appeared to be walking through the town square. She suddenly realized that it was in fact the same man that she had seen in her visions.

The man walked through the town square with a grim look on his face as he passed by the statue of Lord Byron on his way down to the river. He walked right past the town hall and into a small alleyway that led to the back of the shops.

At this point in the dream, Julia started moving towards the town square. She followed after the tall, dark-haired man. The man walked along a small wooden bridge that ran over the river and down into town. The path led right through the center of town and into what appeared to be an old, abandoned building. It was covered in ivy and moss and looked to be on the verge of collapse. The bricks were cracked and peeling away from the walls of it, but one could still see faint outlines of pictures on the wall.

The town square at night.

Julia moved to the edge of the town square and looked down into the alleyway below her. She could see dim lights dancing around in the dark and hear distant sounds of people talking and laughing. She moved to look around the town square, but there was no sign of the townspeople.

Just then a small, dark-haired girl walked out from one of the shops on the town square wearing a white nightgown and holding a lantern over her head to light her way. She carried herself with an air of confidence as she walked down the steps  into the darkened town square.

When Julia realized that she had been seen, she ran away from the dark-haired girl and into the dark building. She looked around for something to defend herself with. The only thing she could see before her was a hammer hanging on the wall in front of her. It was so dirty and worn that it looked like it had been there since the building had last been used.

As Julia turned to go back out into the town square, she heard footsteps behind her and turned around to see who was coming. When she did, something jabbed her in the back and knocked her to the ground. Before she could get up, someone was kneeling on top of her pinning her down. She wrapped her arms around the person’s legs and tried to kick them off of her, but she couldn’t free herself from the grip on her arms.

The figure on top of her was Timothy Jenks. Timothy looked down at Julia and smiled mockingly. “So, you decided to come back out after all?” he asked triumphantly. Julia stared at him blankly for a moment, but then suddenly a look of realization flashed across her face.

Julia was suddenly overcome with a feeling of rage, and she swung her fists around wildly while trying to kick Timothy at the same time. Suddenly, Tim let go of her and jumped away from her on the ground as if he had been burned. He sat on the ground for a second holding his hand to his cheek, looking into the air. When he looked back down at Julia, there was a look of cold fury in his eyes that she hadn’t seen before.

He took a step towards her and pointed his finger at her in accusation. “You think you can just come into my town and screw with everyone’s minds with these visions? You know they’ve almost killed Karen? And your little sister has been crying herself to sleep for weeks now? You think we’re just going to let you get away with that? You have no idea who you’re messing with. Julia!”

Julia suddenly snapped out of her rage and looked at him in surprise. “What do you mean, what do I mean? What do you think I mean? Do you assume that I am one of your little townspeople who can have its mind changed by some stupid vision?  I came here to tell you the truth about the visions and about what they are doing to my family and to Karen. But I was wrong, you don’t want to know the truth. You never wanted to know the truth, and you never will. You are just a puppet following orders like everyone else in your town.”

At this, she turned around to leave, but she stopped and turned back to face them all. “Let me tell you something about the visions. They are not real! I don’t even know what they mean. I have no idea who is generating them or why  they would want to. But you do not see the horrors that I see. You do not feel the horror as I feel it, and there is no way that I can explain what the visions mean to someone like you. Because someone like me can only understand through experiencing them myself.”

She paused for a moment, and then continued. “Do you know what they look like? Do you know what the pictures that I see look like?”

The townspeople stared at her in surprise, and some started to laugh nervously.

“Don’t worry, I don’t blame you for not knowing what they look like. They are so horrible and full of pain that no one should ever have to see them.”

At this point, Julia looked at Karen Jones and said “I am going to apologize to this woman.”

Julia left the townspeople and walked over to Karen.

“Karen?”

“Yes, Julia?” replied Karen with a stern frown.

“This is the first apology that I have ever given in my life, but I would like to apologize for the pain that I have caused you. I know that you blame me for the visions, and I am sorry.”

Karen was taken aback by Julia’s apology, and she hesitated for a moment before responding.

“Thank you, Julia. I appreciate your apology.”

Julia nodded and turned to walk back to the townspeople. As she did, she heard Timothy Jenks call out to her.

“Julia! Wait!”

Julia stopped and turned to face him.

“Yes, Timothy?”

“I wanted to apologize to you for what happened. I was part of the group that attacked you, and I am sorry. I hope that you can forgive me.”",1
Daisy ultimately beats cancer and her story inspires hope in her community.,"She looked up at Lisa with a smile and said, “Lisa, honey… what are you doing here? Did you and Josh fight again?”

	“No, Mom. We didn’t fight this time. I just wanted to come by and see you guys.”

	When Daisy saw Lisa standing there with a worried look on her face, she immediately grew concerned. She thought that maybe Lisa had found out about the cancer from someone else or perhaps another doctor had called her. She was right to worry because that very thing had just happened.

	“Sweetie… you know that I don’t like your father to tell me too much about my appointments with the doctors because he gets so upset. But I got a phone call from one of them this morning and they said that there is no trace of the disease in my body anymore. They didn’t even need to do any more tests!”

	Daisy began to cry and as she embraced her daughter, she said, “Oh, Lisa… I am so relieved to hear that everything is okay now. And I am so happy that we can be honest about this with you now.”As Daisy wiped the tears from her eyes, she looked at Lisa and said, “Sweetie… I am just so glad that you didn’t have to go through all of this by yourself. I love you so much.”

	Lisa walked over to her mother’s bedside and said, “Mom… how long have you known?”

	Daisy answered, “I knew from the very beginning. I was diagnosed about six months ago and ever since then your father and I have been doing everything we can to treat it. We tried all kinds of medicine and even had some experimental treatments that were unsuccessful. But in the end, it was the love and kindness of our family and friends that helped me get through this.”

	Lisa sat down on the other side of her mother’s bed and smiled at her saying, “Well, you know that we love you very much and when we heard what was going on… well, we just couldn’t let it go. So as bad as Dad is at keeping secrets, he managed to keep this one from me for a long time. And I think it was for the best.”Daisy chuckled and said, “I suppose that it might’ve been for the best. It has been a long six months and you have all helped me more than you can know.”

	Lisa continued, “I just wish that I could have been there for you, Mom. So many times I wanted to come over and spend time with you; but every time I did, Dad was there and you seemed so happy that I left and went home.”

	Daisy answered, “Well… Dad didn’t know everything and sometimes it was easier to stay in denial. But… now that we know everything, we can prepare ourselves for the treatments and make sure that we are there for each other.”

	Lisa said smiling, “I still can’t believe that this is happening to you and that I could have lost you so soon! I guess Dad and Maggie were right when they said that you are always with me… even if I don’t realize it.”

	With tears in her eyes, Daisy asked, “What do you mean?”

	Lisa got up and walked over to her closet and opened the door. She grabbed abox from the back and sat back down on the bed next to her mother.

	Daisy took the box from Lisa’s hands and looked at it for a moment, wondering what she could be hiding from her. She then turned it so that she could read what was on top of the box. It read, “Mama’s Keepsakes for Lisa.”

	Lisa looked at her mother with a smile on her face and said, “It is time to pull Mama out of denial and help her to see all of the strength that she really has. Let’s open this box, together!”

	Daisy took a deep breath and wiped away the tears from her eyes. Together they slowly opened the clasp on the box and carefully removed the lid. They then reached inside of the box and pulled out one item at a time.

	The first thing that they pulled out was Daisy’s favorite picture of their family taken years ago when Lisa was still a little girl. It was an eight by ten photo of them all together on the beach in front of their home. They were all smiling and laughing, with the exception of Maggie who was being held tightly by her mother, Daisy. Mr. Simpson was taking the picture and he had caught them all unaware of his presence behind them, but it had turned out to be a very funny photo. This was the only photo that they had that had been taken professionally, and it was by far the best and most precious one that they had ever owned.

	Next they pulled out another album containing photographs that depicted all of the best moments in their lives together as a family. The pictures were also taken professionally and they depicted all of the happy moments that Daisy wished she could return to… but hadn’t been able to. There were pictures from birthdays, holidays, vacations, sporting events and school functions. There were even some candid shots of Mr. Simpson when he wasn’t paying attention to what the camera was doing as it captured his picture.

	It kept getting harder for Daisy to open up each new item that they removed from the box, but she knew that she had to do this if she wanted to see any happiness in her future. The next items that they took out were some books. Lisa handed them to Daisy first and then took them back from her again as they opened each cover hoping to see a story that did not have an ending of death and sorrow.

	The first book was an old photo album that had pictures of Daisy and her family in it when she was younger.",0
"Shannon's father, Mike, dies unexpectedly, leaving her determined to follow in his footsteps and become a successful journalist.","The sun was shining brightly through the windows of Shannon Doyle’s apartment. It was only a little after 7:00 in the morning, but she had already been awake for hours. Today was a big day for Shannon. She had just landed her first major assignment and was anxious to begin writing. She hadn’t slept well the night before, and she spent a great deal of time thinking about what she wanted to write.
     Graduating journalism school and landing her first job in a major newspaper had been Shannon’s greatest accomplishment to date. Ever since she was a child, Shannon had dreamed of becoming a successful journalist just like her father. She would spend hours staring at his framed diploma and reading the articles he had written. She wanted to be just like him.
     Her father, Mike Doyle, had been an excellent writer and reporter. Through the years, he had received many awards for his work in newspapers and magazines throughout the country. He started out at a small-town newspaper before moving on to larger cities and eventually landing a job as a reporter for The Washington Post. Mike was well respected in his field and often traveled all over the world to cover stories. He wrote about countries suchas South Africa, Russia and Egypt. He had interviewed such celebrities as Nelson Mandela, Mikhail Gorbachev and President Hosni Mubarak. Many would agree that he was one of the best journalists in his field.
     As an adult, Shannon followed in her father’s footsteps and enrolled in the School of Journalism at The University of Maryland. She felt certain that she would be able to secure a good job soon after graduation. Shannon had always considered herself a very hard worker, and she knew that her dedication would pay off in the long run. Although she hadn’t landed a job right away, Shannon remained patient and confident that her dream would come true. At last, after months of submitting her resume and applying for numerous jobs, she received a phone call from The Washington Post offering her an internship position at their paper.
     Today was Shannon’s first day as a full-time intern for The Washington Post, and she was anxious to begin reporting on her first assignment. She quickly got dressed and headed down to the kitchen where she made herself a cup of tea. She knew that it was bad for her teeth, but she just couldn’t start her day without a cup of hot Earl Grey in hand.Shannon was born to a middle class family in Rockville, Maryland. Her mother, Lena, owned and ran her own business; she had a knack for interior design and had a successful career in that field for many years. The two of them lived together in a modest home on the outskirts of the city with their two children, Gary and Shannon. Her parents’ marriage wasn’t the happiest one, but they managed to stay together until his death three years ago. Mike Doyle was diagnosed with colon cancer at 49 and passed away only three months later.
Upon graduating from the University of Maryland, Shannon moved into her first apartment in College Park. She quickly became accustomed to living alone and spent many evenings with friends at local bars. Although she had grown up in a somewhat religious household, Shannon decided that she no longer believed in God or an after life and became very promiscuous. She had slept with over 20 different men during her first year of college and continued to sleep around even when she began her internship at the Washington Post.
As Shannon sat down at the kitchen table with her cup of tea, she glanced around at her family pictures hanging on the wall. She wanted to make a goodimpression on her editor and hoped that he would be impressed with the photos of her hanging out with world leaders, former presidents, and other important people. Shannon’s parents were both deceased, but she was especially close to her dad. She had always admired his passion for life and his strong ambition to be successful in everything he did. Even though he was only 49 when he passed away, Shannon knew that her father was extremely talented and well respected in the journalism world. He had worked as a reporter for The Post for 23 years before succumbing to cancer. Shannon’s job was extremely competitive, and she knew that she would have to work very hard in order to succeed. Her greatest fear was not being able to live up to what was expected of her, and she also feared that her new editor might be disappointed by her work. The last thing that Shannon wanted was for anyone to be disappointed by her. She loved being a journalist; it had always been her dream career, and she worked hard at honing her craft. After finishing her tea and taking one last look at the framed photographs on the wall, Shannon grabbed her bag from the counter and headed out the door. As she walked into the office building where The Washington Post was located,Shannon looked around and took in the sights. She noticed how beautiful everything was; it was a vast difference from the way that she imagined it to be. Her first thought after entering the building was that she had no idea what to expect. She wasn’t sure how many people she would meet or what her workspace would look like. All she knew was that she wanted people to think highly of her, and that meant having great ideas and being able to write well so that her editor would be impressed by her work.
The walk to the newsroom took approximately 10 minutes. Once inside, Shannon realized how big the building actually was. There were tons of hallways with doors that opened into countless offices, and it was hard for Shannon to find hers. After walking down a couple of hallways and turning a few corners, she finally found her work space tucked away in a corner of the newsroom. It took Shannon some time to get organized before she could start working on her assignment. It felt like each time she turned around, someone else had created some sort of problem that she had to solve. All of the other interns seemed to have their assignments ready, but none of them seemed to be having any problems; they all looked like seasoned professionals who had already learned",1
"Natalie Harper makes a deal with Trevor Lockwood, a man she met online, to meet him in person in exchange for money so that she can pay her rent .","Natalie Harper made small talk with Trevor Lockwood online for several months. She was attracted to his confidence and good looks, even though he was nearly twenty years her senior. She saw herself as a confident woman, but she lacked the courage to approach him in public, nor would she do so out of respect for her boyfriend. So Natalie Harper had turned to the internet, where she found Trevor Lockwood. He was interested in meeting her in person, if she had enough money for their date. Natalie Harper agreed and they set up a time and place to meet. Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what kind of man she would date. Natalie Harper said that she would go out with someone like Trevor Lockwood, although he was not much older than her. Natalie Harper asked Trevor Lockwood if he was married. He said he wasn’t and had no children. She asked him if he lived alone, and again, his answer was positive. Natalie Harper met Trevor Lockwood in a coffee shop on the second floor of a shopping center in East Sacramento. She asked him to meet her there, but she did not tell him why. She gave him the agreed-upon amount of money—five hundred dollars—which he assured her would be enough for their date . Trevor Lockwood then gave Natalie Harper an address in rural Northern California and told her to come there. Natalie Harper was aware of Trevor Lockwood’s offer prior to this meeting, but she just needed to talk with him face-to-face to make sure he really meant her no harm. Natalie Harper got  in her car and drove towards the area where Trevor Lockwood told her he lived. She turned off Interstate 80 and drove on the country roads that led into his neighborhood. The roads were isolated, but she had a small map with the directions that Trevor Lockwood had given her. Natalie Harper arrived at his home after driving for about an hour. It was a large house set on a hill, surrounded by forest land. Natalie Harper parked her car on the side of the road and walked up to the front door of the house. She knocked and was immediately greeted by Trevor Lockwood, who opened it with a key he retrieved from inside.  Natalie Harper stepped into the house and greeted Trevor Lockwood.

Trevor Lockwood was wearing a black short-sleeved shirt underneath a red cardigan sweater. His face was clean-shaven, except for a goatee that was trimmed close to his mouth. He had dark brown hair, short at the sides and about two inches long in the back. His eyes were blue and he gave off a strong and commanding presence to those he met. Trevor Lockwood was twenty-four years old and living with his parents in their five-bedroom house. He worked part-time at a small marketing firm in San Francisco, but his income was not very high. Trevor Lockwood invited Natalie Harper to sit down on the couch in his living room.

Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper how she liked driving up to his house. She said that she had enjoyed the drive, as it was quiet and peaceful. Trevor Lockwood moved to the edge of the couch and cleared a spot for Natalie Harper. Trevor Lockwood moved closer to Natalie Harper and sat down next to her.

Trevor Lockwood told Natalie Harper that he really enjoyed talking with her online and that he would have much preferred talking with her in person, but circumstances had prevented him from doing so. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand up to Natalie Harper’s shoulder.

Natalie Harper reached for Trevor Lockwood’s hand and placed it on her thigh. She looked at his lips and then smiled at him as she moved her head closer to his mouth. Trevor Lockwood moved his head away from her.

Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper if she had thought of any names for the business venture they were discussing. Trevor Lockwood explained that he had already thought of a name, but he was always willing to listen to suggestions from others. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand slowly up the inside of her thigh and moved it towards her crotch.

Natalie Harper moved Trevor Lockwood’s hand away. She was surprised that Trevor had touched her so soon in their conversation, as they still had so many details to discuss. She told Trevor Lockwood of two possible names that she wanted to consider, and Trevor Lockwood nodded his head.

Trevor Lockwood asked if he could move closer to Natalie Harper on the couch. Natalie Harper agreed and Trevor Lockwood moved next to her on the couch.

Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what she wanted him to do",1
"Mary Smith, George Smith, Jessica Doe, and John Doe all give testimony in court and John Doe is ultimately convicted and sent to prison.","Wilkinson. Jessica Doe repeated what her husband had said to her about the mugging that night. The only differences between their accounts was that Jessica said George Smith used a gun while John Doe said he used a knife; and that George Smith punched John in the face while John said he just hit him with his fist. Karen Wilkinson thanked her for her time and left her house.

Karen Wilkinson next went to the police station to get Louise Spencer’s notes on George Smith’s previous interview. She found that Louise had done extensive research on George Smith and had discovered many of his financial troubles. She also found out that he had moved a lot in his life, having moved at least five times in the past ten years.

Louise Spencer was waiting for her in the interrogation room. She was a tall, dark-haired woman who was very attractive. She had a stern look but she was very polite and professional when they moved into the room. The only furnishings in the room were two plastic chairs placed in front of a small table.

“Thank you for coming by, Miss Wilkinson. I had hoped to question you earlier, but the interrogation ran longer than expected.”

“No problem,” said Karen. It was obvious that Louise Spencer was trying hard to make her comfortable during this interrogation.

“Let us begin then, shall we?” said Louise. “Where were you coming from the night of the mugging?”

“I was coming from my job at the grocery store. They close the doors at 9 o’clock and I usually try to leave a little early so that I can get there before they lock up the doors. On this particular night, it was hard to leave on time because Mr. Smith and I were having an argument when we got home about his moving to another state. We have been trying to move to another state for the last couple of years but always end up staying here for some reason or another.”

“Moving to another state seems like a big step. Why do you want to move?” asked Louise.

“I have a good job here and I don’t want to move away, but my husband wants to move and so we have discussed it over and over again. But he wouldn’t listen to what I had to say this time either, so I  left the house without telling him and decided to walk home because I needed some air.”

“What did Mr. Smith say when you told him that you were leaving?” asked Louise.

“He started shouting that I was being disrespectful and then he called me a damn fool!”

“And what did you do when he said that?” asked Louise.

“I shouted back at him, but before I knew it he had his gun pointed at me and was demanding my money.”

Louise looked at George for a long time before she continued.

“I have a lot of questions about this, Mr. Smith, but before we carry on I need to know whether or not you think Mr. Doe will be convicted for this crime?”

“I don’t think so, no! He has done this sort of thing before and they let him go,” said George.

“Why do you think that he will be convicted this time?” asked Louise.

“I mean, it isn’t like I would really know anything about these things, is it? Do you think he’ll be convicted?” said George.

Louise was silent for a few seconds.

“From what I can gather, Mr. Doe has been in trouble before and is often brought in for questioning, but he has never been convicted of anything before now. From what I can tell he’s a drug addict and is involved with some kind of gang or something, and that is what the police have been focusing on so far. We have evidence to suggest that he has an arrest record for stealing money from other people. I don’t know if you have read the news lately, but this has been going on for quite a while and we have proof that this is not the first time that he has stolen from someone,” said Louise.

George was silent for a while before speaking again.

“This is ridiculous! He isn’t going to be convicted for taking some money from a woman who was walking down the street! This is a joke, right?” said George.

Louise paused again before responding.

“I mean, it isn’t a joke, I will be prosecuting him in court on Monday. There is evidence that he committed the  crime and we have you as a witness who saw it happen, so I don’t see how we can lose. We just need to make sure that John Doe has no opportunity to sway the jury to think otherwise,” said Louise.

“Seriously though, he wasn’t even trying to kill her or anything. If he had wanted to hurt her, he would have done it much more quickly, wouldn’t he? I don’t see how this is going to result in a conviction. What is the worst case scenario for him? I mean, if we were able to come up with some kind of arrangement with the judge or something, couldn’t we make this all go away? I’d be willing to pay a little bit of money to make sure this doesn’t go any further,” said George.

Louise Spencer paused again before responding. She moved her fingers across the table, drumming them on its surface as she thought about what to say.

“I appreciate that you are concerned for John Doe’s well-being here, but we can’t let payment dictate who we prosecute and how seriously we do it. This office has a responsibility to the entire community. We aren’t here to serve the interests of private individuals or corporations—we are here to uphold the law and ensure justice for all,” she said.

“Okay, I understand that this office has an obligation to the community or whatever, but if you think about it, sending him to jail will only make things worse for him. You have to understand—I wasn’t there when they moved him to this office from the precinct, but a lot of his friends were. They said that he was pretty out of it when they put him in this room. They said they had to strap him down in a chair and he was drooling and foaming at the mouth. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that moving him from the cell to this office probably didn’t do him any good. Right? I mean, if you’re going to move him here, at least move him to a room where he can lie down. Or give him something to drink or something. Don’t just leave him here to rot, you know?”

Louise Spencer considered this statement for a moment before responding, “I don’t know what  happened when they moved him here, but this office can’t be responsible for the care of criminals. He was apprehended and brought here based on the evidence collected by police officers. The law says he should be prosecuted and that is exactly what we are going to do. There is no excuse for what he did, and the court will rule accordingly. And if you really care about this man, you’ll do your best to help him in court.”

Tony Wagner stared solemnly at his client for a few seconds before speaking. “You know, not once did you mention that John Doe has been charged with a crime. You didn’t even acknowledge that he’s in this room because of what happened on the street. I think you might want to say something about that.”

Louise raised her eyebrows and walked over to the window separating them from the courtroom. “Forget it. We all know why John Doe is here. He’s being charged with attempted murder, and if they don’t convict him, the court system has gone to hell in a handbasket, that’s all I have to say.”

They moved back into the office and sat down. Their conversation was interrupted by Judge Spencer, who burst through the door, leaving a trail of papers behind him. He looked like he was ready to tear someone apart at the seams for stepping on his paper trail. “Court is starting in five minutes and everybody  needs to be there!”

Tony nodded his head, acknowledging the papers and then said, “Louise, you should probably go.”

She stood up and looked out the window. “I’m not going to that trial. I’m not prosecuting John Doe. I’m not calling any of the witnesses. But this case isn’t just about John Doe. It’s about Mary Smith, too. It’s about all of us, and how we treat each other in this city—and I didn’t see you doing anything to help Mary Smith when she was walking home last night.”

Tony was surprised. “What—what are you talking about? What are you talking about, Louise? This is a trial, don’t get crazy.”

She turned back to face him. “I want to tell Mary Smith’s story. I want to get up there and talk about how she lives with her husband in a tiny apartment that’s falling down around them, and she has to walk home at night by herself because they can’t afford a taxi or a car or even a good pair of shoes—is that crazy enough for you?”

Tony didn’t know what to say. He said, “I don’t think so. It sounds like you are going off on a tangent here, and I don’t think this is the right way to go about this.”

Louise was quiet for a moment, then said, “I’ve talked to Jessica Doe. She needs to be heard in all this too. You know she can’t speak English. She barely speaks at all, in fact—and now she’s in the jury room waiting for this verdict to come down and it doesn’t even seem to have occurred to any of you that she might hear what we say here today. Well it occurred to Jessica, and I thought you should know that. She heard everything you said yesterday. She heard everything Mary Smith said today . And she’s expecting us to give it her straight—not like a bunch of lawyers in a bar playing parlor games.”

Tony said nothing but stood there looking at Louise, his mouth hanging open. “Are you saying that you think she can understand English?”

Louise shook her head. “No. I’m saying that she is listening to everything very carefully and she has a right to an accounting of everything we do here today. She is your client’s wife, Tony, and this isn’t just about protecting John Doe from her influence, trust me. John Doe is not the only one in this room who needs protection from the people he loves.”

Tony Wagner had no response to that and turned toward the jury box. “Your Honor, will you please instruct them to wait outside for a few minutes while I talk to counsel?” John Doe looked confused by this request.

Louise shook Tony Wagner’s arm and tried to drag him the last few steps back to her bench, but he resisted her efforts and turned on his heels toward the jury box instead.

John Doe was confused by this request.  “Your Honor, may I ask the witness some questions?”

Tony Wagner ignored John Doe and continued to stare at Louise as his mouth twisted into a sneer. “Louise, as one of the brightest young lawyers I know, you know full well that Mr. Doe is not allowed to cross-examine Mrs. Smith. Our rules are perfectly clear on this point: neither the defendant nor anyone in his family is allowed to question any of the witnesses against him.” He paused and looked pointedly at John Doe for a moment before adding, “That would include a spouse.”

Louise did not respond, but her eyes narrowed behind the lenses of her glasses as she tried to keep herself under control.

The judge looked over his glasses in irritation. “Defense counsel, let’s make this simple: you know the rules just as well as I do; there will be no more interruptions.”

Tony Wagner nodded his agreement and turned back to face the jury with a look of contempt on his face. “George Smith, do you remember your testimony from yesterday?”

“Yes, I remember it very well.” George Smith shifted nervously in his seat, but spoke in a clear voice.

George Smith testified that he saw the entire incident and that he was certain that the person who had tried to mug his wife was John Doe. He testified that he had seen it all clearly due to the fact that it had happened right in front of his face .

The prosecutor rested his case, and John Doe’s lawyer made a last-minute effort to convince the judge that there was one more witness they wanted to call. It was only after a moment’s hesitation that the judge reluctantly agreed.

George Smith sat down as a young man entered the courtroom and walked up to the witness stand. He was someone Tony Wagner had mentioned in his opening statement, but Mary and Jessica had never seen him before.

The young man cleared his throat and took off his glasses as he began to speak. “My name is Jeffrey Black, and I used to be the prison guard who was assigned to supervise John Doe before he was moved from our cellblock to solitary confinement.”

“What did you do with John Doe?” The judge asked.

“At first, we moved him to a holding cell near the entrance of the prison so that his case could be investigated. After that, he was transferred to a cellblock in solitary confinement and kept there until we received orders to transfer him elsewhere, which we did a few months back.”

“Did you ever speak with John Doe?” Tony Wagner asked.

“Yes, I did. He was a model prisoner, always following the rules and maintaining a positive attitude.",1
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.",". “You are not a bad girl!” he barked in an excited voice.

Then the little dog suddenly stopped wagging his tail and looked at Kitty very seriously. He stared at her for a moment, then said “I don’t understand why somebody would yell at you for being a bad girl when you’re not—can I help you? Can I be of any assistance to you in any way?”

Kitty did not know what to say. She began staring at the ground, not sure what to do next.

Lulu Laverne stared at Kitty for a long moment. Then he nodded his head and smiled again. “I see that you have a problem,” he said in an understanding voice. “In fact, I think I can help you solve it!”

Kitty stared at the little dog. He was so kind and friendly that she almost forgot about the other men shouting at her.

“What is your name?” Kitty finally asked, still staring at the ground.

Lulu Laverne’s tail started wagging again, and his little ears perked up. “My name is Lulu Laverne,” he said in a friendly voice. Kitty looked up at him and smiled. It was nice to see that a dog could be so friendly, especially when some people were being so cruel to her. “And what is your name?”

Kitty hesitated a moment before answering. She still did not know if Sergei was still watching her and listening, but she realized that the kind little dog seemed to genuinely care about her. She began looking up at him again and said, “My name is Kitty Pawsky. I’m a private detective who moved here from the city because I like country life. But now there are some big problems here in the park, and I think it would be good if we all worked together on it. Do you think we can do that?”

Lulu Laverne stopped moving for a moment, and his happy face slowly began to turn a little more serious. “I see you moving your tail,” Kitty said gently. “Is there something wrong? Do you not want to talk about it?” 

Lulu Laverne turned his head away from her. “It’s okay,” he muttered in a quiet voice. “I just have one friend here in the park who likes to tease me sometimes. He leaves catnip mice and feathers all over my house so that I’ll get into trouble when the other dogs see them. Sometimes he even comes inside on of the houses and scares me while I’m sleeping, but then he always leaves a treat for me by my bed, so it’s okay.”

Kitty thought for a moment. “So your friend is the one who does these bad things?” she said.

Lulu Laverne shook his head. “No, he doesn’t do it! He just likes to watch me get into trouble.”

Kitty thought for a moment. “Then it sounds like he’s the one who is doing these bad things, since you keep getting into trouble,” she said.

Lulu Laverne sighed. “I told him to stop a long time ago, but he won’t listen,” he said. “And now I have to go in this house and do my homework…”

Kitty frowned. She knew that this was a bad thing that this friend was doing to Lulu Laverne, but she wasn’t exactly sure how to help him.

“Why doesn’t your friend listen to you?” she asked.

Lulu Laverne sighed again and shook his head. “I don’t know, he just doesn’t like to be told what to do, I guess.”

Kitty thought for a moment. “But you are his friend, and he must care about you a lot, right?” she said.

Lulu Laverne smiled. “Yeah, he does care about me a lot,” he said. “You know, I’m starting to think that maybe I’ll just go into the house and tell my parents about it so they can help me.”

Kitty smiled as well. “That sounds like a good idea,” she said. Then, after a moment, she continued . “Do your homework first though, okay?”

Lulu Laverne laughed. “All right, I’ll do that first!” he said. He started walking off through the park as Kitty called after him.

“Lulu, stay safe, okay?” she said.

Lulu Laverne stopped and turned around to look at her. She smiled again. “I will, Kitty, I will!” he said. He continued walking towards his house as Kitty watched him go. She turned her gaze back to the park.

She saw that Sergei was heading for the swing set. The dogs were looking at him as he approached them. Kitty didn’t understand it, but she was glad that the dogs had someone to play with besides just each other and her; it’s much better when there are more people around to make everything a little more fun.

Kitty moved towards the swing set, ready to go off on another adventure into the dog park and try to figure out what was going on. She had followed Sergei to where he always seemed to go, and now she would work her way through the park and see what sort of clues she could discover.

There was something going on here, Kitty was sure of it. She moved closer to the swing set. The park was quiet. Nothing moved except for the trees and the leaves on them. Kitty moved towards the slide near the swings and moved in a position where she could see both of the swings.

She was moving closer to the swing set when she saw it – a catnip mouse. On the ground next to one of the swings sat a fluffy little gray catnip mouse with black ears and green eyes. It was moving from side to side as if trying to get the attention of the dogs at the park. Kitty moved over to where that was, and then reached out and picked up the toy.

She moved over to where she had last seen Sergei, moving slowly and carefully so that she didn’t step in anything in the park. She moved carefully, because there was a lot of stuff on the ground in the park. There were food scraps, leaves, pine cones and other stuff on the ground all over the place. She moved carefully so that she wouldn’t step in any of this stuff. She could see where some of it came  from – a lot of it had fallen from the trees overhanging the park. But some of it was just there for no reason.

As she moved ahead, she saw that Sergei wasn’t at the swing set anymore. He was near the slide, just moving back and forth like he had been before. He was looking at her as she walked towards him.

“You’re coming to play with me, aren’t you?” said Sergei while wagging his tail at Kitty. “You found my mouse! Now we can chase each other around – it will be so much fun!”

Kitty stared at him, not sure what to say. She didn’t know why he had this mouse with him, or where he was keeping the rest of them. And then she thought about what he had said about killing the dogs. She didn’t want to be around him if he was going to kill more dogs. She backed away from him, and then ran back towards the entrance of the park.

Sergei started chasing after her again, but this time Kitty didn’t stop. She just kept running until she could get out of the park – she didn’t know if the other dogs were here because they wanted to play, or if they thought the same thing she did. But she couldn’t stay and find out.

As soon as Kitty was out of the park, she saw that Jose Cuervo was nearby to her, and called out to him.

“Hey, Jose Cuervo! I need your help!”

She waited for him to come over and talk to her, but he just ran past her, and then she saw him enter the park. She started walking towards the entrance again, but didn’t go in – there were two other dogs there, and she wasn’t sure if they wanted to play with the other dogs or not.

“Hey, hey! Stay there! What’s your problem? Come back here so we can talk.”

Kitty walked towards where the two dogs were. When she got close enough, she shouted, “What’s going on here? Why are all of you in the park – did you get lost or something? I thought this was a place for dogs to come and play, not for them to",0
Daisy ultimately beats cancer and her story inspires hope in her community.,"She looked up at Lisa with a smile and said, “Lisa, honey… what are you doing here? Did you and Josh fight again?”

	“No, Mom. We didn’t fight this time. I just wanted to come by and see you guys.”

	When Daisy saw Lisa standing there with a worried look on her face, she immediately grew concerned. She thought that maybe Lisa had found out about the cancer from someone else or perhaps another doctor had called her. She was right to worry because that very thing had just happened.

	“Sweetie… you know that I don’t like your father to tell me too much about my appointments with the doctors because he gets so upset. But I got a phone call from one of them this morning and they said that there is no trace of the disease in my body anymore. They didn’t even need to do any more tests!”

	Daisy began to cry and as she embraced her daughter, she said, “Oh, Lisa… I am so relieved to hear that everything is okay now. And I am so happy that we can be honest about this with you now.”As Daisy wiped the tears from her eyes, she looked at Lisa and said, “Sweetie… I am just so glad that you didn’t have to go through all of this by yourself. I love you so much.”

	Lisa walked over to her mother’s bedside and said, “Mom… how long have you known?”

	Daisy answered, “I knew from the very beginning. I was diagnosed about six months ago and ever since then your father and I have been doing everything we can to treat it. We tried all kinds of medicine and even had some experimental treatments that were unsuccessful. But in the end, it was the love and kindness of our family and friends that helped me get through this.”

	Lisa sat down on the other side of her mother’s bed and smiled at her saying, “Well, you know that we love you very much and when we heard what was going on… well, we just couldn’t let it go. So as bad as Dad is at keeping secrets, he managed to keep this one from me for a long time. And I think it was for the best.”Daisy chuckled and said, “I suppose that it might’ve been for the best. It has been a long six months and you have all helped me more than you can know.”

	Lisa continued, “I just wish that I could have been there for you, Mom. So many times I wanted to come over and spend time with you; but every time I did, Dad was there and you seemed so happy that I left and went home.”

	Daisy answered, “Well… Dad didn’t know everything and sometimes it was easier to stay in denial. But… now that we know everything, we can prepare ourselves for the treatments and make sure that we are there for each other.”

	Lisa said smiling, “I still can’t believe that this is happening to you and that I could have lost you so soon! I guess Dad and Maggie were right when they said that you are always with me… even if I don’t realize it.”

	With tears in her eyes, Daisy asked, “What do you mean?”

	Lisa got up and walked over to her closet and opened the door. She grabbed abox from the back and sat back down on the bed next to her mother.

	Daisy took the box from Lisa’s hands and looked at it for a moment, wondering what she could be hiding from her. She then turned it so that she could read what was on top of the box. It read, “Mama’s Keepsakes for Lisa.”

	Lisa looked at her mother with a smile on her face and said, “It is time to pull Mama out of denial and help her to see all of the strength that she really has. Let’s open this box, together!”

	Daisy took a deep breath and wiped away the tears from her eyes. Together they slowly opened the clasp on the box and carefully removed the lid. They then reached inside of the box and pulled out one item at a time.

	The first thing that they pulled out was Daisy’s favorite picture of their family taken years ago when Lisa was still a little girl. It was an eight by ten photo of them all together on the beach in front of their home. They were all smiling and laughing, with the exception of Maggie who was being held tightly by her mother, Daisy. Mr. Simpson was taking the picture and he had caught them all unaware of his presence behind them, but it had turned out to be a very funny photo. This was the only photo that they had that had been taken professionally, and it was by far the best and most precious one that they had ever owned.

	Next they pulled out another album containing photographs that depicted all of the best moments in their lives together as a family. The pictures were also taken professionally and they depicted all of the happy moments that Daisy wished she could return to… but hadn’t been able to. There were pictures from birthdays, holidays, vacations, sporting events and school functions. There were even some candid shots of Mr. Simpson when he wasn’t paying attention to what the camera was doing as it captured his picture.

	It kept getting harder for Daisy to open up each new item that they removed from the box, but she knew that she had to do this if she wanted to see any happiness in her future. The next items that they took out were some books. Lisa handed them to Daisy first and then took them back from her again as they opened each cover hoping to see a story that did not have an ending of death and sorrow.

	The first book was an old photo album that had pictures of Daisy and her family in it when she was younger.",0
"Shannon's father, Mike, dies unexpectedly, leaving her determined to follow in his footsteps and become a successful journalist.","The sun was shining brightly through the windows of Shannon Doyle’s apartment. It was only a little after 7:00 in the morning, but she had already been awake for hours. Today was a big day for Shannon. She had just landed her first major assignment and was anxious to begin writing. She hadn’t slept well the night before, and she spent a great deal of time thinking about what she wanted to write.
     Graduating journalism school and landing her first job in a major newspaper had been Shannon’s greatest accomplishment to date. Ever since she was a child, Shannon had dreamed of becoming a successful journalist just like her father. She would spend hours staring at his framed diploma and reading the articles he had written. She wanted to be just like him.
     Her father, Mike Doyle, had been an excellent writer and reporter. Through the years, he had received many awards for his work in newspapers and magazines throughout the country. He started out at a small-town newspaper before moving on to larger cities and eventually landing a job as a reporter for The Washington Post. Mike was well respected in his field and often traveled all over the world to cover stories. He wrote about countries suchas South Africa, Russia and Egypt. He had interviewed such celebrities as Nelson Mandela, Mikhail Gorbachev and President Hosni Mubarak. Many would agree that he was one of the best journalists in his field.
     As an adult, Shannon followed in her father’s footsteps and enrolled in the School of Journalism at The University of Maryland. She felt certain that she would be able to secure a good job soon after graduation. Shannon had always considered herself a very hard worker, and she knew that her dedication would pay off in the long run. Although she hadn’t landed a job right away, Shannon remained patient and confident that her dream would come true. At last, after months of submitting her resume and applying for numerous jobs, she received a phone call from The Washington Post offering her an internship position at their paper.
     Today was Shannon’s first day as a full-time intern for The Washington Post, and she was anxious to begin reporting on her first assignment. She quickly got dressed and headed down to the kitchen where she made herself a cup of tea. She knew that it was bad for her teeth, but she just couldn’t start her day without a cup of hot Earl Grey in hand.Shannon was born to a middle class family in Rockville, Maryland. Her mother, Lena, owned and ran her own business; she had a knack for interior design and had a successful career in that field for many years. The two of them lived together in a modest home on the outskirts of the city with their two children, Gary and Shannon. Her parents’ marriage wasn’t the happiest one, but they managed to stay together until his death three years ago. Mike Doyle was diagnosed with colon cancer at 49 and passed away only three months later.
Upon graduating from the University of Maryland, Shannon moved into her first apartment in College Park. She quickly became accustomed to living alone and spent many evenings with friends at local bars. Although she had grown up in a somewhat religious household, Shannon decided that she no longer believed in God or an after life and became very promiscuous. She had slept with over 20 different men during her first year of college and continued to sleep around even when she began her internship at the Washington Post.
As Shannon sat down at the kitchen table with her cup of tea, she glanced around at her family pictures hanging on the wall. She wanted to make a goodimpression on her editor and hoped that he would be impressed with the photos of her hanging out with world leaders, former presidents, and other important people. Shannon’s parents were both deceased, but she was especially close to her dad. She had always admired his passion for life and his strong ambition to be successful in everything he did. Even though he was only 49 when he passed away, Shannon knew that her father was extremely talented and well respected in the journalism world. He had worked as a reporter for The Post for 23 years before succumbing to cancer. Shannon’s job was extremely competitive, and she knew that she would have to work very hard in order to succeed. Her greatest fear was not being able to live up to what was expected of her, and she also feared that her new editor might be disappointed by her work. The last thing that Shannon wanted was for anyone to be disappointed by her. She loved being a journalist; it had always been her dream career, and she worked hard at honing her craft. After finishing her tea and taking one last look at the framed photographs on the wall, Shannon grabbed her bag from the counter and headed out the door. As she walked into the office building where The Washington Post was located,Shannon looked around and took in the sights. She noticed how beautiful everything was; it was a vast difference from the way that she imagined it to be. Her first thought after entering the building was that she had no idea what to expect. She wasn’t sure how many people she would meet or what her workspace would look like. All she knew was that she wanted people to think highly of her, and that meant having great ideas and being able to write well so that her editor would be impressed by her work.
The walk to the newsroom took approximately 10 minutes. Once inside, Shannon realized how big the building actually was. There were tons of hallways with doors that opened into countless offices, and it was hard for Shannon to find hers. After walking down a couple of hallways and turning a few corners, she finally found her work space tucked away in a corner of the newsroom. It took Shannon some time to get organized before she could start working on her assignment. It felt like each time she turned around, someone else had created some sort of problem that she had to solve. All of the other interns seemed to have their assignments ready, but none of them seemed to be having any problems; they all looked like seasoned professionals who had already learned",1
Anna Cooper must find a way to stop the darkness from taking over the school and protect the innocent students.,"come here expecting to be killed by a monster.

Anna Cooper and Karen Miller are still in the boiler room. The evil spirits of the school have come with them, and they are attacking Anna Cooper and Karen Miller as well. They attack Anna Cooper with punches and kicks, and they try to strangle her. They also try to choke Karen Miller to death. Anna Cooper does not have any superpowers, so she is unable to fight these evil spirits on her own. She is trapped in the boiler room, and she does not know what to do. She calls for help, but nobody comes to rescue her. The boiler room is cold and dark. There is a huge furnace that is burning with deadly fire, and there are large pipes that release steam from the furnace into the air. The temperature in this boiler room is very high, and it feels like all of the moisture has been sucked out of the air. It feels like a furnace.

The boiler room reminds Anna Cooper of certain places in which she has done her laundry. She likes to do her laundry at laundromats, because the machines in her apartment do not work very well. She has to use the laundromat machines if she wants to wash her clothes, because she does not have any hot water.

The boiler room has a strong fire smell, and there is a steamy sound coming from the pipes in the walls. There are no lights in the boiler room, which means that it is very dark. The darkness does not bother Anna Cooper much, because she can still see pretty clearly. Her pupils move back and forth to adjust to the changing levels of light. She moves her eyes back and forth as she hears the steam flowing through the pipes in the boiler room.

She moves her eyes to look at the furnace. It is very hot, and steam is coming out of it in a steamy white-colored plume. The boiler room sounds like a factory. It sounds like the sound of a factory where steel is made in a blast furnace, and big machines operate with loud banging sounds. The banging sounds are similar to the sound that metal things make when they are dropped on the floor or when a heavy metal tool is moved around.

The boiler room looks like an industrial place. It looks like a factory or an office. It is very dirty in there. There are dust and dirt all over the floor, and there are cobwebs in the corners of the room. There is also a smell of  old dust and dirt.

There are some large round pipes that seem to be made of steel, along with some thick metal tubes. There is a big steel gate near the furnace at the far end of the boiler room.

The boiler room is filled with pipes and pipes, tubes and tubes, pumps and  valves, all kinds of valves and switches, some giant round iron pipes that are connected to the furnace. The place looks like a junkyard. Everything is rusty and dirty.

She moves her eyes from here to there in the boiler room. She walks around looking at different things. Her brain is thinking about what happened to Lily Washington. She is not feeling very happy, and she wants to get out of the boiler room.

A door opens at the back of the boiler room behind her, and Karen steps through it. She closes the door behind her.

Karen does not look happy either. Her eyes are red, and her face is pale. It looks like she has been crying.

Karen Miller’s footsteps echo loudly as she walks toward her. The boiler room gets dark slowly, and there is a small glimmer of light on the floor near Karen.

“Well, well. You really did it this time, didn’t you?” she says angrily.

Karen moves her hands quickly through the air as if trying to calm herself. Anna is confused, because “do what” doesn’t make any sense.  She is looking at Karen with bewildered eyes, but she does not say anything.

Karen is still moving her hands through the air in front of her face, and she is talking too fast for Anna to understand. “It’s all your fault, Cooper! It’s all your fault that Lily Washington got hurt.”

Karen stops moving her hands in the air and turns around to look at Anna. She is looking directly into her eyes, but she is not saying anything now. Anna looks away from Karen’s eyes because it makes her nervous. Anna Cooper is getting closer to Karen, and she sees that there are tears on her cheeks now. Karen has never cried before, so this makes Anna curious.

Karen looks at Lily and then back at Anna. “I guess you know that if you rescue Lily now, we’re all going to be rescued, Cooper. Right?” she says.

Anna Cooper is shaking her head. “Yeah, I know that! But what do you want me to rescue Lily from?” she asks.

Karen shakes her head and holds out her hands as if she is trying to  grab Anna’s arms. “What are you talking about, Cooper? You know exactly what I’m talking about,” she says.

Anna takes a step backwards with her arms folded across her chest. “I don’t know what you want, Karen! You need to tell me what you want me to do!” she insists.

Karen looks down at the floor, then she looks back up at Anna. “No! I have to show you, Cooper! I have to show you everything that is going on here,” she says.

Anna Cooper looks over at the door and then down at the floor. She does not like what she is seeing, and she has a bad feeling about what Karen wants her to do. She thinks that Karen is not telling her the truth, and she does not believe her anymore. “Okay! Whatever you think you have to do! But I’m afraid I can’t wait much longer. The others will come looking for me soon, and I know that you won’t be able to keep them out of here for much longer than –” Anna is interrupted by a sudden sound – the sound of footsteps coming from outside the door.

“Cooper! Cooper, are you in there?” Karen calls out. She places her hand onto the doorknob and tries to open it.

But it is no use. The door is locked from the outside. Out of desperation, she bangs on the door with her fist, screaming: “Cooper! Cooper!”

Daniel Cooper has finally arrived. Anna hears his footsteps coming down the hallway as he approaches the boiler room .

Anna sighs in relief and picks up the mop once more, looking down at the floor and at the puddle of water that she just cleaned up. She wonders how she is ever going to get out of this mess.

"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.",". “You are not a bad girl!” he barked in an excited voice.

Then the little dog suddenly stopped wagging his tail and looked at Kitty very seriously. He stared at her for a moment, then said “I don’t understand why somebody would yell at you for being a bad girl when you’re not—can I help you? Can I be of any assistance to you in any way?”

Kitty did not know what to say. She began staring at the ground, not sure what to do next.

Lulu Laverne stared at Kitty for a long moment. Then he nodded his head and smiled again. “I see that you have a problem,” he said in an understanding voice. “In fact, I think I can help you solve it!”

Kitty stared at the little dog. He was so kind and friendly that she almost forgot about the other men shouting at her.

“What is your name?” Kitty finally asked, still staring at the ground.

Lulu Laverne’s tail started wagging again, and his little ears perked up. “My name is Lulu Laverne,” he said in a friendly voice. Kitty looked up at him and smiled. It was nice to see that a dog could be so friendly, especially when some people were being so cruel to her. “And what is your name?”

Kitty hesitated a moment before answering. She still did not know if Sergei was still watching her and listening, but she realized that the kind little dog seemed to genuinely care about her. She began looking up at him again and said, “My name is Kitty Pawsky. I’m a private detective who moved here from the city because I like country life. But now there are some big problems here in the park, and I think it would be good if we all worked together on it. Do you think we can do that?”

Lulu Laverne stopped moving for a moment, and his happy face slowly began to turn a little more serious. “I see you moving your tail,” Kitty said gently. “Is there something wrong? Do you not want to talk about it?” 

Lulu Laverne turned his head away from her. “It’s okay,” he muttered in a quiet voice. “I just have one friend here in the park who likes to tease me sometimes. He leaves catnip mice and feathers all over my house so that I’ll get into trouble when the other dogs see them. Sometimes he even comes inside on of the houses and scares me while I’m sleeping, but then he always leaves a treat for me by my bed, so it’s okay.”

Kitty thought for a moment. “So your friend is the one who does these bad things?” she said.

Lulu Laverne shook his head. “No, he doesn’t do it! He just likes to watch me get into trouble.”

Kitty thought for a moment. “Then it sounds like he’s the one who is doing these bad things, since you keep getting into trouble,” she said.

Lulu Laverne sighed. “I told him to stop a long time ago, but he won’t listen,” he said. “And now I have to go in this house and do my homework…”

Kitty frowned. She knew that this was a bad thing that this friend was doing to Lulu Laverne, but she wasn’t exactly sure how to help him.

“Why doesn’t your friend listen to you?” she asked.

Lulu Laverne sighed again and shook his head. “I don’t know, he just doesn’t like to be told what to do, I guess.”

Kitty thought for a moment. “But you are his friend, and he must care about you a lot, right?” she said.

Lulu Laverne smiled. “Yeah, he does care about me a lot,” he said. “You know, I’m starting to think that maybe I’ll just go into the house and tell my parents about it so they can help me.”

Kitty smiled as well. “That sounds like a good idea,” she said. Then, after a moment, she continued . “Do your homework first though, okay?”

Lulu Laverne laughed. “All right, I’ll do that first!” he said. He started walking off through the park as Kitty called after him.

“Lulu, stay safe, okay?” she said.

Lulu Laverne stopped and turned around to look at her. She smiled again. “I will, Kitty, I will!” he said. He continued walking towards his house as Kitty watched him go. She turned her gaze back to the park.

She saw that Sergei was heading for the swing set. The dogs were looking at him as he approached them. Kitty didn’t understand it, but she was glad that the dogs had someone to play with besides just each other and her; it’s much better when there are more people around to make everything a little more fun.

Kitty moved towards the swing set, ready to go off on another adventure into the dog park and try to figure out what was going on. She had followed Sergei to where he always seemed to go, and now she would work her way through the park and see what sort of clues she could discover.

There was something going on here, Kitty was sure of it. She moved closer to the swing set. The park was quiet. Nothing moved except for the trees and the leaves on them. Kitty moved towards the slide near the swings and moved in a position where she could see both of the swings.

She was moving closer to the swing set when she saw it – a catnip mouse. On the ground next to one of the swings sat a fluffy little gray catnip mouse with black ears and green eyes. It was moving from side to side as if trying to get the attention of the dogs at the park. Kitty moved over to where that was, and then reached out and picked up the toy.

She moved over to where she had last seen Sergei, moving slowly and carefully so that she didn’t step in anything in the park. She moved carefully, because there was a lot of stuff on the ground in the park. There were food scraps, leaves, pine cones and other stuff on the ground all over the place. She moved carefully so that she wouldn’t step in any of this stuff. She could see where some of it came  from – a lot of it had fallen from the trees overhanging the park. But some of it was just there for no reason.

As she moved ahead, she saw that Sergei wasn’t at the swing set anymore. He was near the slide, just moving back and forth like he had been before. He was looking at her as she walked towards him.

“You’re coming to play with me, aren’t you?” said Sergei while wagging his tail at Kitty. “You found my mouse! Now we can chase each other around – it will be so much fun!”

Kitty stared at him, not sure what to say. She didn’t know why he had this mouse with him, or where he was keeping the rest of them. And then she thought about what he had said about killing the dogs. She didn’t want to be around him if he was going to kill more dogs. She backed away from him, and then ran back towards the entrance of the park.

Sergei started chasing after her again, but this time Kitty didn’t stop. She just kept running until she could get out of the park – she didn’t know if the other dogs were here because they wanted to play, or if they thought the same thing she did. But she couldn’t stay and find out.

As soon as Kitty was out of the park, she saw that Jose Cuervo was nearby to her, and called out to him.

“Hey, Jose Cuervo! I need your help!”

She waited for him to come over and talk to her, but he just ran past her, and then she saw him enter the park. She started walking towards the entrance again, but didn’t go in – there were two other dogs there, and she wasn’t sure if they wanted to play with the other dogs or not.

“Hey, hey! Stay there! What’s your problem? Come back here so we can talk.”

Kitty walked towards where the two dogs were. When she got close enough, she shouted, “What’s going on here? Why are all of you in the park – did you get lost or something? I thought this was a place for dogs to come and play, not for them to",0
"Mary Smith, George Smith, Jessica Doe, and John Doe all give testimony in court and John Doe is ultimately convicted and sent to prison.","Wilkinson. Jessica Doe repeated what her husband had said to her about the mugging that night. The only differences between their accounts was that Jessica said George Smith used a gun while John Doe said he used a knife; and that George Smith punched John in the face while John said he just hit him with his fist. Karen Wilkinson thanked her for her time and left her house.

Karen Wilkinson next went to the police station to get Louise Spencer’s notes on George Smith’s previous interview. She found that Louise had done extensive research on George Smith and had discovered many of his financial troubles. She also found out that he had moved a lot in his life, having moved at least five times in the past ten years.

Louise Spencer was waiting for her in the interrogation room. She was a tall, dark-haired woman who was very attractive. She had a stern look but she was very polite and professional when they moved into the room. The only furnishings in the room were two plastic chairs placed in front of a small table.

“Thank you for coming by, Miss Wilkinson. I had hoped to question you earlier, but the interrogation ran longer than expected.”

“No problem,” said Karen. It was obvious that Louise Spencer was trying hard to make her comfortable during this interrogation.

“Let us begin then, shall we?” said Louise. “Where were you coming from the night of the mugging?”

“I was coming from my job at the grocery store. They close the doors at 9 o’clock and I usually try to leave a little early so that I can get there before they lock up the doors. On this particular night, it was hard to leave on time because Mr. Smith and I were having an argument when we got home about his moving to another state. We have been trying to move to another state for the last couple of years but always end up staying here for some reason or another.”

“Moving to another state seems like a big step. Why do you want to move?” asked Louise.

“I have a good job here and I don’t want to move away, but my husband wants to move and so we have discussed it over and over again. But he wouldn’t listen to what I had to say this time either, so I  left the house without telling him and decided to walk home because I needed some air.”

“What did Mr. Smith say when you told him that you were leaving?” asked Louise.

“He started shouting that I was being disrespectful and then he called me a damn fool!”

“And what did you do when he said that?” asked Louise.

“I shouted back at him, but before I knew it he had his gun pointed at me and was demanding my money.”

Louise looked at George for a long time before she continued.

“I have a lot of questions about this, Mr. Smith, but before we carry on I need to know whether or not you think Mr. Doe will be convicted for this crime?”

“I don’t think so, no! He has done this sort of thing before and they let him go,” said George.

“Why do you think that he will be convicted this time?” asked Louise.

“I mean, it isn’t like I would really know anything about these things, is it? Do you think he’ll be convicted?” said George.

Louise was silent for a few seconds.

“From what I can gather, Mr. Doe has been in trouble before and is often brought in for questioning, but he has never been convicted of anything before now. From what I can tell he’s a drug addict and is involved with some kind of gang or something, and that is what the police have been focusing on so far. We have evidence to suggest that he has an arrest record for stealing money from other people. I don’t know if you have read the news lately, but this has been going on for quite a while and we have proof that this is not the first time that he has stolen from someone,” said Louise.

George was silent for a while before speaking again.

“This is ridiculous! He isn’t going to be convicted for taking some money from a woman who was walking down the street! This is a joke, right?” said George.

Louise paused again before responding.

“I mean, it isn’t a joke, I will be prosecuting him in court on Monday. There is evidence that he committed the  crime and we have you as a witness who saw it happen, so I don’t see how we can lose. We just need to make sure that John Doe has no opportunity to sway the jury to think otherwise,” said Louise.

“Seriously though, he wasn’t even trying to kill her or anything. If he had wanted to hurt her, he would have done it much more quickly, wouldn’t he? I don’t see how this is going to result in a conviction. What is the worst case scenario for him? I mean, if we were able to come up with some kind of arrangement with the judge or something, couldn’t we make this all go away? I’d be willing to pay a little bit of money to make sure this doesn’t go any further,” said George.

Louise Spencer paused again before responding. She moved her fingers across the table, drumming them on its surface as she thought about what to say.

“I appreciate that you are concerned for John Doe’s well-being here, but we can’t let payment dictate who we prosecute and how seriously we do it. This office has a responsibility to the entire community. We aren’t here to serve the interests of private individuals or corporations—we are here to uphold the law and ensure justice for all,” she said.

“Okay, I understand that this office has an obligation to the community or whatever, but if you think about it, sending him to jail will only make things worse for him. You have to understand—I wasn’t there when they moved him to this office from the precinct, but a lot of his friends were. They said that he was pretty out of it when they put him in this room. They said they had to strap him down in a chair and he was drooling and foaming at the mouth. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that moving him from the cell to this office probably didn’t do him any good. Right? I mean, if you’re going to move him here, at least move him to a room where he can lie down. Or give him something to drink or something. Don’t just leave him here to rot, you know?”

Louise Spencer considered this statement for a moment before responding, “I don’t know what  happened when they moved him here, but this office can’t be responsible for the care of criminals. He was apprehended and brought here based on the evidence collected by police officers. The law says he should be prosecuted and that is exactly what we are going to do. There is no excuse for what he did, and the court will rule accordingly. And if you really care about this man, you’ll do your best to help him in court.”

Tony Wagner stared solemnly at his client for a few seconds before speaking. “You know, not once did you mention that John Doe has been charged with a crime. You didn’t even acknowledge that he’s in this room because of what happened on the street. I think you might want to say something about that.”

Louise raised her eyebrows and walked over to the window separating them from the courtroom. “Forget it. We all know why John Doe is here. He’s being charged with attempted murder, and if they don’t convict him, the court system has gone to hell in a handbasket, that’s all I have to say.”

They moved back into the office and sat down. Their conversation was interrupted by Judge Spencer, who burst through the door, leaving a trail of papers behind him. He looked like he was ready to tear someone apart at the seams for stepping on his paper trail. “Court is starting in five minutes and everybody  needs to be there!”

Tony nodded his head, acknowledging the papers and then said, “Louise, you should probably go.”

She stood up and looked out the window. “I’m not going to that trial. I’m not prosecuting John Doe. I’m not calling any of the witnesses. But this case isn’t just about John Doe. It’s about Mary Smith, too. It’s about all of us, and how we treat each other in this city—and I didn’t see you doing anything to help Mary Smith when she was walking home last night.”

Tony was surprised. “What—what are you talking about? What are you talking about, Louise? This is a trial, don’t get crazy.”

She turned back to face him. “I want to tell Mary Smith’s story. I want to get up there and talk about how she lives with her husband in a tiny apartment that’s falling down around them, and she has to walk home at night by herself because they can’t afford a taxi or a car or even a good pair of shoes—is that crazy enough for you?”

Tony didn’t know what to say. He said, “I don’t think so. It sounds like you are going off on a tangent here, and I don’t think this is the right way to go about this.”

Louise was quiet for a moment, then said, “I’ve talked to Jessica Doe. She needs to be heard in all this too. You know she can’t speak English. She barely speaks at all, in fact—and now she’s in the jury room waiting for this verdict to come down and it doesn’t even seem to have occurred to any of you that she might hear what we say here today. Well it occurred to Jessica, and I thought you should know that. She heard everything you said yesterday. She heard everything Mary Smith said today . And she’s expecting us to give it her straight—not like a bunch of lawyers in a bar playing parlor games.”

Tony said nothing but stood there looking at Louise, his mouth hanging open. “Are you saying that you think she can understand English?”

Louise shook her head. “No. I’m saying that she is listening to everything very carefully and she has a right to an accounting of everything we do here today. She is your client’s wife, Tony, and this isn’t just about protecting John Doe from her influence, trust me. John Doe is not the only one in this room who needs protection from the people he loves.”

Tony Wagner had no response to that and turned toward the jury box. “Your Honor, will you please instruct them to wait outside for a few minutes while I talk to counsel?” John Doe looked confused by this request.

Louise shook Tony Wagner’s arm and tried to drag him the last few steps back to her bench, but he resisted her efforts and turned on his heels toward the jury box instead.

John Doe was confused by this request.  “Your Honor, may I ask the witness some questions?”

Tony Wagner ignored John Doe and continued to stare at Louise as his mouth twisted into a sneer. “Louise, as one of the brightest young lawyers I know, you know full well that Mr. Doe is not allowed to cross-examine Mrs. Smith. Our rules are perfectly clear on this point: neither the defendant nor anyone in his family is allowed to question any of the witnesses against him.” He paused and looked pointedly at John Doe for a moment before adding, “That would include a spouse.”

Louise did not respond, but her eyes narrowed behind the lenses of her glasses as she tried to keep herself under control.

The judge looked over his glasses in irritation. “Defense counsel, let’s make this simple: you know the rules just as well as I do; there will be no more interruptions.”

Tony Wagner nodded his agreement and turned back to face the jury with a look of contempt on his face. “George Smith, do you remember your testimony from yesterday?”

“Yes, I remember it very well.” George Smith shifted nervously in his seat, but spoke in a clear voice.

George Smith testified that he saw the entire incident and that he was certain that the person who had tried to mug his wife was John Doe. He testified that he had seen it all clearly due to the fact that it had happened right in front of his face .

The prosecutor rested his case, and John Doe’s lawyer made a last-minute effort to convince the judge that there was one more witness they wanted to call. It was only after a moment’s hesitation that the judge reluctantly agreed.

George Smith sat down as a young man entered the courtroom and walked up to the witness stand. He was someone Tony Wagner had mentioned in his opening statement, but Mary and Jessica had never seen him before.

The young man cleared his throat and took off his glasses as he began to speak. “My name is Jeffrey Black, and I used to be the prison guard who was assigned to supervise John Doe before he was moved from our cellblock to solitary confinement.”

“What did you do with John Doe?” The judge asked.

“At first, we moved him to a holding cell near the entrance of the prison so that his case could be investigated. After that, he was transferred to a cellblock in solitary confinement and kept there until we received orders to transfer him elsewhere, which we did a few months back.”

“Did you ever speak with John Doe?” Tony Wagner asked.

“Yes, I did. He was a model prisoner, always following the rules and maintaining a positive attitude.",1
The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"After that, I just need you to focus on getting better now.”

Lisa stood up at this point and walked into the other room to collect Daisy’s notebook. She returned to her chair and opened up the notebook. The first few pages were dedicated to instructions on how their family was going to take care of things while she was away, and the last few pages contained some words of wisdom that she wanted her children to read after they got over the initial shock of her passing.

Just before she started reading, Lisa stopped and held the notebook up for a moment, considering her words. “You know, maybe I shouldn’t read this part of the notebook to them.”

“Oh? Why not?”

“It might be too much to handle at one time. It might be too much for them to process all at once.”

Lisa stopped to consider that point for a moment, then looked up at Daisy. “Can I just tell them some things right now, and read the rest of the words later?”

“Of course. Whatever you think is best for your children. But there are some things that I have written down that I would like them to hear before I pass on.”

Lisa nodded her head and settled back into her chair. “Okay, well first, they should know that you wrote about how proud you were of them. Both the way they have dealt with this so far, and the way they have taken care of everything at home while I’m at the hospital with you. You talked a lot about how much confidence you had in them to do the job, even when I wasn’t here. You said that you thought Lisa was ready to handle almost everything, and that she was ready to take over the business if she ever had to. And you were also very proud of both of them for all their hard work in school. You said that you had a good feeling about the direction they were headed.” Lisa paused at this point, but she could see in Daisy’s eyes that she was still fully awake and listening. “I’m not sure when they should know about the other parts, though,” she continued. “You talked about some important things that will affect them when I’m gone. There were things that we need to talk about as a family. ”

At this point, Daisy’s eyelids began to flutter a little bit and she gasped for air. Lisa looked over at the nurse at the desk and made some hand gestures, which got her attention. The nurse came over and checked Daisy’s vital signs before looking back at Lisa and nodding. “It’s probably just a side effect from these injections,” she explained. “She might need some oxygen for a few minutes, but she should be fine. Give her a second to rest and then try to talk again.”

Lisa nodded and put the side of her hand on Daisy’s forehead to check her temperature. “I should have brought your hat,” she said as she thought about what else might be troubling Daisy.

“Is it going to be all right?” Daisy asked in a groggy voice. “Are you going to be there when everything happens?”

Lisa tried to speak through her own nervousness. “Of course I will be there,” she assured Daisy and then moved closer to listen as the nurse explained what was happening. “I think you might be getting a little bit of a fever,” she said as she took Daisy’s pulse. “They just need to give you some oxygen and we should be on our way again soon. You have been such a trooper,” the nurse continued before turning to Lisa and adding, “You’ve been doing a terrific job of taking care of her. She’s got a great family. I know she will be fine.”

Lisa tried to control her breathing and nodded in response. “As soon as they give you the okay, I’ll go sit with my mom in the waiting room. She’s already told me all the things she wanted me to know if something happened,” she said before the nurse could interrupt.

Daisy opened her eyes and slowly turned her head toward Lisa. “Thank you for being there for all of us today,” she said. “I know it hasn’t been easy for you, but if there is any way I can repay you someday, just let me know.”

Lisa reached out a hand and brought it to her lips in response. “I don’t want to talk  about that just yet. I just want to get through today and see how things look in the morning. After we talk to the doctor tomorrow, I’ll have a better idea of what we need to do after you leave here.”

When Lisa turned back toward Daisy, her eyes were filled with tears. The nurse stepped up beside them and wiped her hand on a tissue before reaching out to touch Daisy’s arm.

“Mrs. Mayberry, I think your daughter is worn out and needs to go home for a little while before coming back this evening. She has been such a help today and really been an inspiration to many of the other patients. I know she is a special person, but her strength today has been so uplifting to everyone here.”

Daisy nodded in agreement as the nurse spoke. “I think she should go home too. She gets up early every day, comes to take care of me, and then gets back here before dark to do whatever I need her to do. If you don’t mind, I would like her to stay here with me tonight. I want us to talk for a while before she goes home.”

Lisa glanced over at her and smiled weakly, but it was obvious that the emotional strain from the day was now starting to show. As they stood up and started walking toward the door, Lisa reached out and squeezed her mom’s hand. “I know you are tired, but I’m glad you are staying here tonight. I really want to talk about this afternoon and what happened in my office.”

“Me too,” Daisy said as she squeezed her hand back. “I think you should get some rest though because I want to tell you all about it while it is still fresh in my mind.”

They both smiled at one another as they walked out of the room and started down the hall toward Lisa’s office. There was a sudden explosion of activity around them as nurses and doctors scurried to and fro with charts, medicine carts, equipment, and other assorted paraphernalia. However, the commotion abruptly ended as they entered the hallway and walked by without a glance at them.

In the quiet of the hallway, they made their way down to Lisa’s office and took seats across from each other on her sofa. “Okay,  tell me everything you know about this trial,” Lisa said as she picked up her laptop and began turning it on.

Daisy sighed heavily as she sat back in the love seat and pulled her feet up underneath her. She pulled both hands through her hair in frustration, and then started talking. “I really don’t know much about it except that the doctor said it is an experimental treatment for people with the particular type of lung cancer I have. He told me that he was sending me to Memorial Hospital in St. Louis for an evaluation before I could be enrolled in the trial. He said he had been contacted by a research committee at the hospital and that they would meet me and evaluate me. I’m supposed to leave tomorrow at noon,” she said as she leaned back and covered her eyes with her hand.

Lisa sat behind her desk and folded her hands in front of her. “That’s great news! It will be such a relief to have you out of the house and somewhere where I can drop by whenever I need to. You’ve become too difficult to deal with lately,” she said. She quickly added, “I don’t mean that as an insult.”

Daisy looked at Lisa and smiled. “I know you didn’t mean it as an insult. I have been difficult to deal with lately, but maybe now that I am leaving for a while it will give you some rest and you won’t feel so overwhelmed. Maybe it will also relieve Bill of some of the stress he’s been under,” she said. They both sat silently for a moment before Daisy continued, “I think this could be the answer to our problems. I could come through this and we wouldn’t have to worry so much about where the money is going to come from. We could be financially secure again. And, as we used to say in school…it will be like having found the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.”

“I agree,” said Lisa. She then added, “But what about me? How do I know that you’re going to come through this and be fine? What if it doesn’t work out and you die anyway? How can I go on living without you? You’re all I have. Who is going to take care of me",1
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.",". “You are not a bad girl!” he barked in an excited voice.

Then the little dog suddenly stopped wagging his tail and looked at Kitty very seriously. He stared at her for a moment, then said “I don’t understand why somebody would yell at you for being a bad girl when you’re not—can I help you? Can I be of any assistance to you in any way?”

Kitty did not know what to say. She began staring at the ground, not sure what to do next.

Lulu Laverne stared at Kitty for a long moment. Then he nodded his head and smiled again. “I see that you have a problem,” he said in an understanding voice. “In fact, I think I can help you solve it!”

Kitty stared at the little dog. He was so kind and friendly that she almost forgot about the other men shouting at her.

“What is your name?” Kitty finally asked, still staring at the ground.

Lulu Laverne’s tail started wagging again, and his little ears perked up. “My name is Lulu Laverne,” he said in a friendly voice. Kitty looked up at him and smiled. It was nice to see that a dog could be so friendly, especially when some people were being so cruel to her. “And what is your name?”

Kitty hesitated a moment before answering. She still did not know if Sergei was still watching her and listening, but she realized that the kind little dog seemed to genuinely care about her. She began looking up at him again and said, “My name is Kitty Pawsky. I’m a private detective who moved here from the city because I like country life. But now there are some big problems here in the park, and I think it would be good if we all worked together on it. Do you think we can do that?”

Lulu Laverne stopped moving for a moment, and his happy face slowly began to turn a little more serious. “I see you moving your tail,” Kitty said gently. “Is there something wrong? Do you not want to talk about it?” 

Lulu Laverne turned his head away from her. “It’s okay,” he muttered in a quiet voice. “I just have one friend here in the park who likes to tease me sometimes. He leaves catnip mice and feathers all over my house so that I’ll get into trouble when the other dogs see them. Sometimes he even comes inside on of the houses and scares me while I’m sleeping, but then he always leaves a treat for me by my bed, so it’s okay.”

Kitty thought for a moment. “So your friend is the one who does these bad things?” she said.

Lulu Laverne shook his head. “No, he doesn’t do it! He just likes to watch me get into trouble.”

Kitty thought for a moment. “Then it sounds like he’s the one who is doing these bad things, since you keep getting into trouble,” she said.

Lulu Laverne sighed. “I told him to stop a long time ago, but he won’t listen,” he said. “And now I have to go in this house and do my homework…”

Kitty frowned. She knew that this was a bad thing that this friend was doing to Lulu Laverne, but she wasn’t exactly sure how to help him.

“Why doesn’t your friend listen to you?” she asked.

Lulu Laverne sighed again and shook his head. “I don’t know, he just doesn’t like to be told what to do, I guess.”

Kitty thought for a moment. “But you are his friend, and he must care about you a lot, right?” she said.

Lulu Laverne smiled. “Yeah, he does care about me a lot,” he said. “You know, I’m starting to think that maybe I’ll just go into the house and tell my parents about it so they can help me.”

Kitty smiled as well. “That sounds like a good idea,” she said. Then, after a moment, she continued . “Do your homework first though, okay?”

Lulu Laverne laughed. “All right, I’ll do that first!” he said. He started walking off through the park as Kitty called after him.

“Lulu, stay safe, okay?” she said.

Lulu Laverne stopped and turned around to look at her. She smiled again. “I will, Kitty, I will!” he said. He continued walking towards his house as Kitty watched him go. She turned her gaze back to the park.

She saw that Sergei was heading for the swing set. The dogs were looking at him as he approached them. Kitty didn’t understand it, but she was glad that the dogs had someone to play with besides just each other and her; it’s much better when there are more people around to make everything a little more fun.

Kitty moved towards the swing set, ready to go off on another adventure into the dog park and try to figure out what was going on. She had followed Sergei to where he always seemed to go, and now she would work her way through the park and see what sort of clues she could discover.

There was something going on here, Kitty was sure of it. She moved closer to the swing set. The park was quiet. Nothing moved except for the trees and the leaves on them. Kitty moved towards the slide near the swings and moved in a position where she could see both of the swings.

She was moving closer to the swing set when she saw it – a catnip mouse. On the ground next to one of the swings sat a fluffy little gray catnip mouse with black ears and green eyes. It was moving from side to side as if trying to get the attention of the dogs at the park. Kitty moved over to where that was, and then reached out and picked up the toy.

She moved over to where she had last seen Sergei, moving slowly and carefully so that she didn’t step in anything in the park. She moved carefully, because there was a lot of stuff on the ground in the park. There were food scraps, leaves, pine cones and other stuff on the ground all over the place. She moved carefully so that she wouldn’t step in any of this stuff. She could see where some of it came  from – a lot of it had fallen from the trees overhanging the park. But some of it was just there for no reason.

As she moved ahead, she saw that Sergei wasn’t at the swing set anymore. He was near the slide, just moving back and forth like he had been before. He was looking at her as she walked towards him.

“You’re coming to play with me, aren’t you?” said Sergei while wagging his tail at Kitty. “You found my mouse! Now we can chase each other around – it will be so much fun!”

Kitty stared at him, not sure what to say. She didn’t know why he had this mouse with him, or where he was keeping the rest of them. And then she thought about what he had said about killing the dogs. She didn’t want to be around him if he was going to kill more dogs. She backed away from him, and then ran back towards the entrance of the park.

Sergei started chasing after her again, but this time Kitty didn’t stop. She just kept running until she could get out of the park – she didn’t know if the other dogs were here because they wanted to play, or if they thought the same thing she did. But she couldn’t stay and find out.

As soon as Kitty was out of the park, she saw that Jose Cuervo was nearby to her, and called out to him.

“Hey, Jose Cuervo! I need your help!”

She waited for him to come over and talk to her, but he just ran past her, and then she saw him enter the park. She started walking towards the entrance again, but didn’t go in – there were two other dogs there, and she wasn’t sure if they wanted to play with the other dogs or not.

“Hey, hey! Stay there! What’s your problem? Come back here so we can talk.”

Kitty walked towards where the two dogs were. When she got close enough, she shouted, “What’s going on here? Why are all of you in the park – did you get lost or something? I thought this was a place for dogs to come and play, not for them to",0
Paula meets Sally in college and the two become best friends.,"Paula Taylor knew something was missing in her life, but she couldn’t quite name it. She had a good job, nice house, and two beautiful kids. She had wonderful friends and her family was great too. Her marriage to Jack was solid but she thought that it might be better if he didn’t expect her to be the perfect wife.
	She looked at Lily, her daughter who was playing on the floor with a plastic toy phone when she realized something that could fill the void. She spent hours teaching Lily how to talk and potty train her, but there was one thing she wasn’t taught: what kind of man to choose as her husband. That was something only Paula knew how to teach.
	It wouldn’t be hard to find someone, she knew plenty. They were all around her, just waiting for a chance to get close to her and have their way with her body. But Sally was the one woman who had been by her side since college and she would have to be the first. The only question was how to approach this delicate subject.
	She took off her glasses and placed them on the table next to her half-empty glass of wine. She watched as Lily crawled over tothem and picked up her glasses. She was careful to not let Lily accidentally press any buttons with her sticky fingers. Paula smiled at the thought of how much she loved raising Lily and seeing her grow up to be such an adorable child. There is nothing better than spending time with your family, she thought.
	Paula was in her early 30s, but would never admit it in public. No matter what age she was, the years seemed to fly by and each day she woke up more and more exhausted. It wasn’t just from staying up late too many nights or the lack of sleep that accompanies raising a kid, but something else was wrong. She had developed restless leg syndrome for the last couple years which made it nearly impossible for her to sleep at night or relax during the day.
	Paula took a deep breath and slowly exhaled, trying to calm herself down so she could make an important decision. If only she could get some sleep, then maybe everything would fall into place. That’s all she needed was a good night’s rest. How long has it been since I’ve had one of those? She thought to herself.
	Jack came home from work and kissed Paula on the forehead as he enteredthe room. As tired as Paula felt, there was no way she could sleep with him around. She needed to sneak away while he was off doing whatever it was that men did at night.
	“How are you feeling?” Jack asked.
	“Great! Everything is going really well at work,” Paula lied.
	Paula had spent the last couple hours researching restless leg syndrome on the Internet and knew everything she needed to know about it. Her symptoms were pretty classic, but she wasn’t ready to tell Jack the truth yet. Or anyone else for that matter.
	Jack rubbed her shoulders and kissed her on the cheek before heading off to bed. “Sleep tight sweetie,” he said.
	Paula smiled to herself and grabbed Lily by the hand as she began her nightly walk around the house and out onto the back patio where they both sat down in lawn chairs. Lily usually fell asleep within five minutes, but tonight she seemed unusually alert for some reason. As Paula looked down at her daughter, it reminded her of the way Sally used to look when they were in college. They had met their freshman year at a frat party while Jack was still married to his first wife.Sally was young and beautiful, but she was also the most down-to-earth, wonderful friend Paula had ever met. 	Soon after meeting Sally, Paula began spending more time at her apartment than at her own place. When Sally’s parents would go out of town, Paula would even stay over for a few nights. Sometimes they would just go out to dinner and talk about what their future would look like once they were done with school. The more time Paula spent with Sally, the more she admired her.
	It took them until their senior year to admit that they really wanted something more than just friendship between them, but when they did it was clear that being together was right. There were no questions asked and no regrets made as they made love for the first time. And although it didn’t happen all that often, Paula sometimes wished that she could go back and relive those years with Sally all over again.
	Paula still hadn’t told Lily about how she met Sally in college – especially since Lily’s father was so adamant about keeping the truth from her – but as she sat there staring at her sleeping daughter, Paula wished that she could talk to Sally about what was going on in their lives right then. She wanted Sally’s advice on what she should do about Lily’s father having another baby with another woman. She wanted to see if Sally had any experience with this sort of situation, or if she even knew a little bit about what was going through Paula’s head.
	She shook her head and tried to snap herself out of it, but when she turned back around to look at Lily all she could see was that the girl was a carbon copy of Sally. She had a head full of brown hair, just like her mother and sister did, and the same green eyes – just like Sally and Joel. Even though Paula had only ever seen one picture of her biological father, it was clear that Lily looked just like him as well.
	Paula turned back around and continued to stare at the blank screen on the laptop sitting next to her on a small round table near the bed. She had no idea how long she had been contemplating Lily’s future when a noise in the hallway caused her to jump up off of the bed and rush into the living room. Paula flipped on the lights and spun around to see Jack walking into the house with a look of relief plastered across his face.",1
"Shannon's father dies and her first book fails, leading her to doubt her talent.","Shannon took a drag from her cigarette and exhaled her smoke into the cold night air. Her house was quiet now; she had finished unpacking everything and had spent the evening hours reading in her room. It was only ten o’clock, but Shannon knew she would be unable to fall asleep tonight. She knew this because this wasn’t the first time she had lost someone close to her.

Shannon was twenty-two years old but already had experienced more heartbreak than most people do in their entire lives. First, her mother left when she was two years old and later on it was her biological father who decided that he didn’t want anything to do with her anymore. Then, when Shannon was nineteen, her adoptive father had died of a heart attack at the age of forty-four. Three months later, Shannon found out that she had been rejected from Columbia and instead was accepted into NYU.

Although Shannon didn’t want to admit it, being rejected from Columbia had made her feel like a failure. Her father’s death just compounded the problem. She felt like people would always expect her to fail at everything she tried to do. Shannon knew that eventually she would get over the rejection, but she didn’t know how long it would take.

She had been forced to find a job in order to provide her own support, so that meant she hadn’t been able to spend all of her time writing. After trying for several weeks to write and coming up empty-handed, Shannon wasn’t sure if she would ever be able to write again. Her agent, Samantha Shaw, had warned her to give herself some time and suggested that Shannon start working on another book. Although it hadn’t been too long since she finished her first one, she figured it was worth a shot.

For the past couple of months, all Shannon had done was read other people’s books and pretend that they were stories about herself. This was hard for her because it made her feel as if she couldn’t think up new ideas of her own – which was something that she did all the time when she wrote short stories as a kid. Shannon doubted whether or not she would be able to write anything again, but luckily it wasn’t long before something started happening.

One morning, while Shannon was flipping through a magazine, an idea popped into her head and wouldn’t leave her alone untilshe began writing it down. This time, the ideas were coming to her more quickly than ever before. The more she thought about them, the easier it got for her to put words on paper. Writing the book took much less time than she was expecting, and soon she had finished the first draft of what would become her second novel. Shannon was happy with how it turned out, but she wasn’t sure if she should show it to anyone yet.

The only people who had read her first book were friends and family members, though Samantha Shaw had helped her get it published. Samantha had also been helping Shannon secure movie rights to the book, but so far there hadn’t been any interest in it by anyone in Hollywood. Recently, Shannon had spoken to one of her professors about selling movie rights, and he told her that unless your first book is a best-seller, it will be difficult to get movie rights for subsequent books. She was pretty pissed off with him for telling her that because he didn’t know anything about the movie business.

Shannon knew she had to show someone her second novel right away, but she wasn’t sure who. Samantha Shaw was the only other person who had read both of her novels, and Shannon didn’t want to pressure her into giving an opinion about it. She didn’t know if she could handle hearing negative feedback after all of the struggles she had gone through getting people to read her first book. Besides, Sam was a busy woman and she might find it very difficult to actually give Shannon any feedback on her work.

Shannon was also thinking about Luke Saunders. He had told Shannon that he would help her get movie rights for her book, but he had yet to do anything about it. In fact, Shannon hadn’t heard from Luke in almost a month. She was feeling a little bitter about that because he had promised to help her and he hadn’t followed through. However, Shannon didn’t want to be rude and just stop taking his calls completely because he was still a nice guy, even if he wasn’t being very helpful at the moment.

Shannon eventually decided that the best person to read her new novel was Abby Fuller. She knew that Abby would give her an honest opinion and there were likely to be no hard feelings if she didn’t like it. Abby had been one of Shannon’s best friends for almost ten years now, so she knewthat Abby wouldn’t hold back just because she didn’t want to hurt Shannon’s feelings.

Shannon sent Abby an email inviting her to lunch at a little café near NYU, and she waited outside of the café for a few minutes until Abby showed up. When Abby arrived, Shannon pointed out that they had been friends for a long time so they should be honest with each other. However, Shannon also wanted Abby to know that no matter what might happen, they would still both be her friends.

They got into the café and ordered some sandwiches. Shannon told Abby about what had happened in the past few months and she seemed genuinely sympathetic toward her struggles. For most of their lunch, the two women talked about normal things such as what was going on in their lives and any plans that they had for the weekend. But then Shannon changed the subject slightly by telling Abby about her new novel.

Shannon explained that she was really happy with it and she thought it might be her best work yet. However, she also said that she didn’t feel ready to share it with anyone else yet because she wasn’t sure how they would react. She was worried that they wouldn’t like it or that they",1
Jennifer comes home from work to find her husband in bed with another woman.,"An Unpleasant Surprise

Jennifer Leighton was driving home from work. It had been a particularly long and trying day at her office, and she looked forward to getting home. Her husband, Scott, was a successful architect. For nearly ten years, they lived in an apartment in New York City while Scott worked on designing a large corporate headquarters and Jennifer served as his secretary. When the project was completed, they moved to Boston. Jennifer resumed work as a secretary, but now Scott managed his own firm.

Jennifer arrived home after nine o’clock, the time when she would normally be preparing dinner. But tonight was different. Jennifer parked her car in front of their suburban home and went inside. She walked through the living room and into the kitchen. She was surprised to see that their kitchen table was completely clean; there were no dirty dishes in sight. She then realized that this was not her home, and she wondered where she was .

She heard faint voices coming from the next room. She cautiously walked into the dining room and saw her husband at the table, having dinner with another woman. The woman turned around. It was Rachel Saunders. Jennifer’s eyes widened as she stared at Rachel, stunned by the realization that her husband was having an affair.

“Scott!” Jennifer said breathlessly. “What a pleasant surprise!” Scott did not answer. He just looked at her, his eyes full of guilt and remorse, his face ashen white.

“What are you doing here?” Rachel said. “I thought you were in Boston for the day.”

“No, I just came home early,” Scott said quietly. “By the way, do you mind if I join you for dinner?”

Jennifer was still standing in the doorway when she heard Rachel say, “Of course not.” She entered the room and sat down next to him at the table.

They both just stared at each other for several seconds before Jennifer finally spoke up. “How long have you been seeing each other?”

Scott frowned and said, “It doesn’t matter. We have to break off the affair.”

“What? Why? What happened? Is something wrong between us? Have we grown apart so much that we don’t love each other anymore or what? We can work this out, Scott. We just need to sit down and talk about it.”

“We can’t ‘work this out,’” he said firmly. “I know you think this is an easy decision to make, but I assure you that it isn’t. This has been going on for several weeks now. Rachel and I have fallen in love with each other and we cannot ignore our feelings any longer. You are a wonderful woman, Jenny, but we both know that something isn’t right between us. It might take me a long time to figure out what exactly that is, but I know for certain that we can’t go on together the way we have been. We need to separate and live our own lives.”

Jennifer thought about all he had said, then replied, “Do you know how many relationships I’ve seen  come apart because one partner was unfaithful? I love you, Scott. I thought everything between us was fine. You’ve told me that we have a happy marriage and how much you love me and how much I mean to you. How can you say this is for the best?”

He sighed and reached over to hold her hand. “I know that this is terribly unfair, Jenny, but I can’t live a lie any longer. I don’t want to hurt you, but we both need to move on and let each other find happiness elsewhere.” 

Jennifer looked down at her lap, then up at her husband. “What about the kids? Who do they live with?”

He felt like his heart was being ripped out. “I suggest joint custody, or perhaps we could switch off every other week or so.”

Jennifer fought back tears. “What about our finances?” she asked, trying to sound detached. “We have a mortgage to pay and kids to raise. How much money do you think I can get from you for the divorce?”

Jennifer’s husband shrugged again. “I dunno, maybe a couple of thousand dollars? I don’t want to fight over this. I want it all settled quickly and fairly.” He turned away and stared out the window. “I want a divorce, Jennifer. Let me",1
"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.","and we might be able to meet up more frequently. Do you want to go to NYC?”

Jenna shook her head in response as she replied, “If I go to Italy, I’ll have to talk with Antonia and Damian at some point. Why can’t I just go there and talk with them now?”

Liam shrugged his shoulders as he said, “I don’t know. She did say that you shouldn’t come back to the US for a while. This might have something to do with it. But if we don’t go, you won’t be able to help me in any way, because I can’t tell Antonia and Damian about being bitten by Dracula. Who knows what they are capable of doing?”

Jenna understood the danger that could be in store for Liam if he told anyone about his bite. She also knew that he was right – she wouldn’t be able to help him if she didn’t go to Italy. Getting back to her attacker was her only priority at this moment, and she had to do whatever it took. “Ok, I’ll go to NYC with you, but first we will have to talk with Randolph Howe. Once we are done, I’ll head off to Italy.”

Liam nodded in agreement as he said, “Deal!” Jenna was feeling happy that they were going to see Randolph Howe again; she liked him, and she trusted his knowledge of vampires.

They found the vampire community easily. It was still quite early when they arrived, so only a handful of people were walking about. Everybody seemed to be going about their business quietly and respectfully, which made for a very peaceful first impression. As they walked towards the community, Jenna felt a bit uneasy. It seemed like everyone had heard of her – there were many people looking at them as if they were some kind of celebrities.

It also seemed like everyone knew that she was missing, and had returned; most vampires around here looked surprised to see her. Some didn ’t seem as surprised, and Jenna recognized the looks on their faces. They were the faces of people who knew that she had been hurt, because they had been there when it happened.

Randolph was already sitting at his desk when they arrived at the community building, but he did stand up and greet Jenna. “Jenna, good to see you again!” He then reached out his hand to Liam. “And you must be Liam Cross?”

“Yes, sir, I am. I think we have met before?” Jenna noticed that Gregory Maldonado was sitting in the corner of the office, listening in.

“I don’t think so. But I do recognize you from pictures and stuff. You are Gregory Maldonado’s son, right?”

Gregory nodded quietly. “That is correct.”

Liam smiled at Gregory. It was a stiff smile, but he was trying to be polite. “Nice to meet you, sir.”

Gregory nodded back to him. “Likewise, Mr. Cross. Now, let us move into a private room; we can talk there.” Gregory Maldonado then stood up and gestured for them to follow him.

They moved into the next room, which was a rather large office with a large desk.

Gregory sat down behind the desk, and then gestured for them to sit across from him. “Now, let us move on to the reason why you are here. Jenna, I have heard through channels that you are trying to track down Gregory Maldonado’s son?”

“Yes sir, I am. He is guilty of several crimes that he has committed in Seattle and now in my  town. I want to know where he is so I can bring him to justice.”

Gregory Maldonado laughed quietly at her words. “Really? Do you truly think he will be brought to justice if you do find him?”

Liam was starting to get nervous at this conversation. It sounded like something was being set up here, but he didn’t know what it was.

Jenna gave Gregory an annoyed look. “I do, actually. I just need to find him first so that I can give the evidence I have to the FBI.”

“You are working for them now, and yet you want to turn your back on them? There is no need to do that. I have people that can help you track down his son, and then they will turn their attention to Antonia Rossi. She has a few people keeping an eye on the club tonight, but I am sure we can move it somewhere else for a night or two. But if we do that, then it would be better if we did it now, as opposed to later. If we wait too long, we will have a lot more eyes on us.

Liam was starting to get really nervous at this point. He moved a little closer to Jenna just in case he needed to shield her or something.

Jenna took a couple of seconds to think about this before speaking again. “Moving the club is okay with me, but moving it tonight might be a bad idea.”

“Moving it to somewhere safe is not a problem. Moving it to somewhere that our enemies can attack without fear of getting hurt would probably be a poor decision. Moving the club now might be an even worse idea though.”

This was starting to sound like moving the club was a bad idea no matter what.

Jenna looked over at Antonia. “Moving the club tonight is completely out of the question. We have a huge event tonight at Club Red, and everyone is looking forward to it. Why not move it to another club tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow night might be a better choice, anyway. If you move the club now, no one would know what or where the change was, and that could make matters even worse for you. You would then have to deal with the people who knew you might move the  club, as well as those who guessed right and chose to follow you there.”

Jenna looked at Antonia for a little while. This made sense, so she said, “I guess I could postpone the move until tomorrow. Yes, I will be sure that everyone knows what’s happening by the end of tonight.”

Antonia Rossi nodded a few times, and then said, “I would be happy to help with whatever you need when it comes to your attacker. I do not have much experience with that sort of thing, but I know others who may be able to help  me.”

Jenna sighed and said, “Okay. I appreciate that. But I have a feeling that the person who did this is going to be killed tonight, if they aren’t already.”

Antonia Rossi looked at Jenna for a long time and said, “What makes you think that? It seems that only Damian was seen leaving your alley, and he was arrested shortly thereafter.”

“I saw him leave my alleyway, but not after he assaulted me. He had a knife in his hand. I even got a good look at it, and I know that there’s no way that he could have killed me if he was holding it. He may have moved to the alleyway after he stabbed me, but did so much later. I’m not sure of the exact time frame, but it was definitely after the attack. And if he moved to my alleyway after the attack, then maybe he ran into Damian Henchman there, which is why he was arrested.”

Damian Henchman said, “Jenna, that is a possibility. Damian has already been questioned by the police about what happened to you. It is possible that they talked about moving to your alleyway. But why would you think that only one person was responsible for your attack?”

“Because I didn’t see anyone else that night. I didn’t hear anyone else, either. And I definitely didn’t feel anyone moving around me in the dark.”

Antonia piped up, “Jenna is right. She was moving around a lot with her superhuman speed and agility, and she would have noticed if someone was anywhere near her.”

“Well, I can tell you that someone was moving around, because I did feel something,” said Jenna. “But it was only one thing moving around me. For the most part, that thing just held still and waited for the right time to pounce. So I moved around a little bit myself to figure out what was going on, but then it moved in the same minute that I did. And then it just held still while I tried to fight back, and then it jumped on me, picked me up, and carried me away from wherever I was walking. Then it carried me over to the alleyway between your club and my apartment building. And then it  stabbed me, and I don’t really remember anything after that.”

Dread filled Jenna’s heart as she thought about everything she had been through. This was certainly the worst thing that had ever happened to her in her entire life, and yet it wasn’t even close to the worst attack that had been made against her.

All around them, everyone watched and listened intently.

“This is a very serious accusation you are making, Miss Riley,” said Judge White. “There is no proof that Damian Henchman is your attacker at all. You were found covered with blood in a back alley, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he attacked you there. In fact, it doesn’t even necessarily mean that he attacked you at all. The evidence will be presented tomorrow morning. Until then, Mr. Henchman will remain in custody here at the courthouse.”

Jenna nodded, and they exited the courtroom together. They moved to a separate room in the basement of the courthouse, a holding cell where they could speak privately and still be guarded by both security personnel and police officers. Judge White ordered security to escort both Jenna and Henchman into this room. They moved to the room, accompanied by four security guards and a detective who had worked on the case.

The courtroom was large and imposing. The holding cell was small and cramped. Jasper moved to one corner of it, opposite the door, while Damian moved to another corner opposite him. Jenna took up a position in the middle of the room, facing both men.

Jenna was standing very still, staring intently at Damian Henchman. It was clear that she had moved past being just angry to being downright furious with him now. She had stopped herself from attacking him, but only barely—she could feel that she was holding herself back by a thread of willpower alone.

Damian moved to the center of the room as well, facing Jenna. His face was clean-shaven now, and he did not look like himself at all. He looked smaller, more vulnerable than before. He moved to the center of the room, moving past a metal divider that separated Jenna from him.

Jenna moved to one side of the divider, away from Damian Henchman.

Damian looked at Jasper, then to one of the security officers in the room, gesturing with his head for them to leave. The security officer nodded and moved to the door, opening it and gesturing for the other three men to leave as well.

The detective lingered for a moment, looking first at Jenna, then at Damian. He hesitated, then moved to leave as well.

Jenna watched the men leave, then turned her attention back to Damian.

""You attacked me,"" she said, her voice low and dangerous. It was not a question.

Damian swallowed, but did not say anything. He looked away from Jenna's gaze.

""Why?"" Jenna asked. ""What did I ever do to you?""

Damian shook his head. ""You didn't do anything,"" he said. ""It wasn't personal.""

""Not personal?"" Jenna repeated, her voice incredulous. ""You nearly killed me, and you say it wasn't personal?""",1

Jennifer’s husband shrugged again. “I dunno, maybe a couple of thousand dollars? I don’t want to fight over this. I want it all settled quickly and fairly.” He turned away and stared out the window. “I want a divorce, Jennifer. Let me",1
"Shannon's father dies and her first book fails, leading her to doubt her talent.","Shannon took a drag from her cigarette and exhaled her smoke into the cold night air. Her house was quiet now; she had finished unpacking everything and had spent the evening hours reading in her room. It was only ten o’clock, but Shannon knew she would be unable to fall asleep tonight. She knew this because this wasn’t the first time she had lost someone close to her.

Shannon was twenty-two years old but already had experienced more heartbreak than most people do in their entire lives. First, her mother left when she was two years old and later on it was her biological father who decided that he didn’t want anything to do with her anymore. Then, when Shannon was nineteen, her adoptive father had died of a heart attack at the age of forty-four. Three months later, Shannon found out that she had been rejected from Columbia and instead was accepted into NYU.

Although Shannon didn’t want to admit it, being rejected from Columbia had made her feel like a failure. Her father’s death just compounded the problem. She felt like people would always expect her to fail at everything she tried to do. Shannon knew that eventually she would get over the rejection, but she didn’t know how long it would take.

She had been forced to find a job in order to provide her own support, so that meant she hadn’t been able to spend all of her time writing. After trying for several weeks to write and coming up empty-handed, Shannon wasn’t sure if she would ever be able to write again. Her agent, Samantha Shaw, had warned her to give herself some time and suggested that Shannon start working on another book. Although it hadn’t been too long since she finished her first one, she figured it was worth a shot.

For the past couple of months, all Shannon had done was read other people’s books and pretend that they were stories about herself. This was hard for her because it made her feel as if she couldn’t think up new ideas of her own – which was something that she did all the time when she wrote short stories as a kid. Shannon doubted whether or not she would be able to write anything again, but luckily it wasn’t long before something started happening.

One morning, while Shannon was flipping through a magazine, an idea popped into her head and wouldn’t leave her alone untilshe began writing it down. This time, the ideas were coming to her more quickly than ever before. The more she thought about them, the easier it got for her to put words on paper. Writing the book took much less time than she was expecting, and soon she had finished the first draft of what would become her second novel. Shannon was happy with how it turned out, but she wasn’t sure if she should show it to anyone yet.

The only people who had read her first book were friends and family members, though Samantha Shaw had helped her get it published. Samantha had also been helping Shannon secure movie rights to the book, but so far there hadn’t been any interest in it by anyone in Hollywood. Recently, Shannon had spoken to one of her professors about selling movie rights, and he told her that unless your first book is a best-seller, it will be difficult to get movie rights for subsequent books. She was pretty pissed off with him for telling her that because he didn’t know anything about the movie business.

Shannon knew she had to show someone her second novel right away, but she wasn’t sure who. Samantha Shaw was the only other person who had read both of her novels, and Shannon didn’t want to pressure her into giving an opinion about it. She didn’t know if she could handle hearing negative feedback after all of the struggles she had gone through getting people to read her first book. Besides, Sam was a busy woman and she might find it very difficult to actually give Shannon any feedback on her work.

Shannon was also thinking about Luke Saunders. He had told Shannon that he would help her get movie rights for her book, but he had yet to do anything about it. In fact, Shannon hadn’t heard from Luke in almost a month. She was feeling a little bitter about that because he had promised to help her and he hadn’t followed through. However, Shannon didn’t want to be rude and just stop taking his calls completely because he was still a nice guy, even if he wasn’t being very helpful at the moment.

Shannon eventually decided that the best person to read her new novel was Abby Fuller. She knew that Abby would give her an honest opinion and there were likely to be no hard feelings if she didn’t like it. Abby had been one of Shannon’s best friends for almost ten years now, so she knewthat Abby wouldn’t hold back just because she didn’t want to hurt Shannon’s feelings.

Shannon sent Abby an email inviting her to lunch at a little café near NYU, and she waited outside of the café for a few minutes until Abby showed up. When Abby arrived, Shannon pointed out that they had been friends for a long time so they should be honest with each other. However, Shannon also wanted Abby to know that no matter what might happen, they would still both be her friends.

They got into the café and ordered some sandwiches. Shannon told Abby about what had happened in the past few months and she seemed genuinely sympathetic toward her struggles. For most of their lunch, the two women talked about normal things such as what was going on in their lives and any plans that they had for the weekend. But then Shannon changed the subject slightly by telling Abby about her new novel.

Shannon explained that she was really happy with it and she thought it might be her best work yet. However, she also said that she didn’t feel ready to share it with anyone else yet because she wasn’t sure how they would react. She was worried that they wouldn’t like it or that they",1
Sally unexpectedly dies and Paula must deal with the guilt of her secret and the possibility of what could have been.,"hurt himself, worried that he wasn’t treating Sally right because of his job situation, and most of all, worried that he wasn’t going to be around when Sally died.

When Sally finally did die, it was too much for Paula to bear. She broke down and sobbed uncontrollably as Sally lay motionless on the bed. Paula felt guilty for all of the suffering she had caused—for David not being there when Sally passed away, for her affair with Sally’s husband and everything that had come along with it, and for caring so much about him that she forgot to care about her best friend Sally. Guilty. Guilt was the only word that described Paula’s feelings at that point. She thought about how she could have been a better person, how she could have loved Sally even more and made sure that she got better, and how her whole life would be different if only Sally hadn ’t died.

Paula stood up from the bed and walked over to the window overlooking the backyard. She tried controlling her sobbing, but gave up when she saw David and Sally’s daughter playing in the park across the street. She walked back over to the bed, where Sally lay. Sally was completely still with her mouth slightly open and a look of emptiness in her eyes.

“She looks so peaceful,” Paula thought as she gently reached down and rested her hand on Sally’s shoulder.

All of a sudden, there was a loud bang from the kitchen as the sound of dishes clattering and plates smashing against the cabinets filled the air. Paula jumped up from Sally’s side and rushed over to investigate.

When she moved into the kitchen, she saw David standing next to their old refrigerator, which had been moved over by the wall to make room for a new one. The refrigerator was completely open, and David appeared to be moving around inside of it as if he were looking for something.

“What are you doing?” Paula exclaimed as she moved further into the kitchen, and then stopped in her tracks when she saw what David was doing.

David was moving his arms up and down as if he were trying to break some sort of imaginary barrier between himself and … Sally.

Paula moved closer to David behind him, where he didn’t seem to realize she was there. She gently placed her hand on his shoulder and turned him around towards her. David seemed to jump a little when Paula moved up against him, causing him to look startled at first. Then he moved his arms behind his back in an apparent attempt to loosen them up before looking down at the floor and muttering, “This isn’t good.”

“What isn’t?” Paula asked, moving a little closer to him.

David kept moving his arms in front of him for a brief moment before finally looking up at Paula and saying through clenched teeth, “The reason I moved my arm in front of me is because I moved a couple of things out of the way so I could get to the bottom shelf.”

Paula moved a little closer to him, almost crowding him as she gently put her hand on his face and turned it towards hers. “Oh,” she said softly.  “You were trying to break down the barrier between you and your wife?”

David turned his head away from Paula for a moment before looking back at her. He then looked down at the floor again as he shifted his weight from foot to foot, saying, “We have an agreement here. We agreed I would keep this a secret in order to let her family grieve in peace and not cause them any more pain, at least for now, and in exchange they agreed to not say anything if I ever came home.”

Paula quietly nodded her head, agreeing with David and saying,  “That was very considerate of you, David. I know how hard it must be for you to stay away from her now that she’s gone.” Paula then moved even closer to him, putting her arm around his shoulder and hugging him in the process as she said with tears in her eyes, “I’m sorry, David. I didn’t mean to upset you like this. I just thought you might want me to leave and let you be alone for a while …”

David looked back into Paula’s eyes, now fully crying himself, as he saw his wife’s death reflected in her face. David said in a shaky voice, “I really wish you would leave. I promised to give her family some time to grieve and that’s what I’m going to do. Please go and let me be alone for now …”

Paula saw the truth of David’s words as she also felt the guilt of what she had done to him. She then slowly moved away from him, and as she stepped out the door she nodded her head in agreement, saying nothing in response to his request. As soon as she was out the door, she ran down the steps of their home with tears streaming down her face and, once outside, fell on the ground sobbing uncontrollably.

She cried so hard that she completely forgot about the baby in her arms as Lily began crying herself when she heard her mother sobbing. Lily then began crying loudly herself, which made Paula even more upset. She didn’t want to go back inside, yet she couldn’t face the neighbors anymore as they might see her crying and know what had happened.

So, with Lily still in her arms, she made her way across the back deck, entered the garage and then closed the garage door behind her. When she entered the garage, she turned to close the door that led into their house, but stopped when she saw a car parked next to David’s car. She wondered whose car it was as she hadn’t seen it there before. After a few seconds of staring at the car, she walked over to it and peered inside. It was Josh’s car; he wasn’t supposed to be home until tomorrow night.

She stood there for a minute watching Josh move around inside the garage as he opened and closed various cabinets and drawers.  He stopped what he was doing and turned around when he heard the door shut behind her.

“I wasn’t expecting you until tomorrow,” Paula said as she entered the garage and walked over to Josh.

Josh stared at her for a few moments before replying, “I got an early break in my schedule and decided to come home early.”

Paula nodded and stared at the floor before adding, “I guess I didn’t see your car because….”

Josh interrupted her by saying, “David and I went to the airport to get Lily.",1
Julia Martin starts to experience terrifying visions.,"Julia Martin lay in her bed. She was trying to calm down and slow her breathing. The images in her head were becoming clearer and clearer. She could see the townspeople as they walked about in their normal routine, going about their business. They looked pretty normal, but they were missing something that Julia couldn’t put her finger on, but she knew that she would know it when she saw.

She could see people walking by the grocery store, and suddenly a strange aura appeared around the door of the store. The aura was a very bright white light, and Julia found herself feeling afraid for no apparent reason. Julia started to feel a sense of dread, and she didn’t understand why. Her eyes started to tear up, and a lump formed in her throat. She felt scared, and she felt like she had to run away. She ran as fast as she could away from the grocery store, but  still she felt like something was coming after her.

The light from the grocery store seemed to follow Julia wherever she ran, always remaining just out of reach. The townspeople now seemed to be changing in Julia’s vision. She could see that they had begun a process of degeneration. The people around her were becoming more and more strange.

They were losing their bodies, and now they were nothing but gray masses, moving about the streets in a ghostly fashion. No longer did they have any discernible faces or bodies; all that she could see was a mass of moving gray clouds. They moved among the stores like a cloud of smoke, occasionally forming into a face or an animal and then dissipating again.

They seemed to be looking straight at Julia, but she couldn’t quite tell if they were even aware of her. They were moving in a very strange manner, with no apparent destination in mind. They glided from the streets into people’s homes and back again, making no sense whatsoever. Now the townspeople were trying to enter her own home.

As soon as they entered, they vanished, leaving behind only gray ash on the floor. She tried to close her eyes so that she might not be forced to look upon these bizarre ghosts, but she found that she was unable to.

She opened them again, and found herself staring at the entrance to her own home. In front of her was a young man with no face or body, who seemed to be holding an arm outstretched towards her. It was as if he were beckoning her to follow him, but there was nothing she could do. She had no legs with which to move, only a cloud of moving gray ash. Still, it appeared that whatever he was beckoning her to follow him into had a definite destination in mind; it wasn’t just wandering aimlessly through people’s homes.

More and more of these silhouettes started to appear before her. For some reason she did not question this occurrence; it was as if she had come to accept the fact that these ghosts would be coming into her house. They entered from every  side, and though they had no feet they were able to make their way through the floor as if it were water. They seemed to want not only to enter her house, but also to remain inside.

She could see them clearly now, because they had all taken on the gray color of her home. She saw that they were all people she knew in one form or another, and many of them had faces that had been torn apart or sliced off, a terrible sight. They didn’t seem to be aware of that, though; they simply stood there waiting for her to follow them into her home. She knew that she had to do it.

She was led into the living room, and saw that her house had been invaded by these gray silhouettes. At first she thought that they were looking at her, but then realized that they were all looking past her towards a house at the end of the street where a woman lived with her two children. The silhouettes were coming forward in a line, and they began to move towards the woman’s house.

Thelma Bates was now standing in front of Julia, and she was pointing to the house down the street. She could see the silhouette of Thelma become more distinct in the gray cloud that surrounded them both.

“That’s where it all starts to go awry. That’s where it begins, and then before you know it, the visions are everywhere. Each one more terrible than the last.” 

Thelma began to walk down the street towards the woman with her two children. Julia wanted to go and warn her, but she was unable to move from where she was standing. She tried to call out, but could not force any sounds out of her mouth. She could see Thelma walking slowly down the street with the other silhouettes in her wake. When Thelma reached the woman’s house, she gestured for Julia to follow her. This time, Julia was able to make sounds, and she began to yell at Thelma, “What are you doing?”

“We have to show them what’s going on. We can’t let them enter that house without knowing what they are getting into,” Thelma said as she turned to Julia.

Julia continued to yell, “But they will get hurt! And so will you!”

As much as Julia wanted to stop what was happening, she could not muster up the strength to move. She tried again to yell and move her body, but both were still impossible. She heard a door open and then the sound of footsteps on the floor of the house. The figure of the woman appeared at the window and began to stare at Julia and Thelma. She stared with such fright that it frightened Julia even more.

The figure of the woman slowly turned away from the window, but she did not enter the room. Instead, she raised her hand and began to hit herself in the face over and over again.

Julia tried to yell louder, but she was still entirely incapable of moving. She was glad that Tim was in the house with them, but he was too far away for her to call out loud enough for him to hear. She wanted to scream so that he would help her, but she was mute. Thelma had jumped back and was waving to get Tim’s attention, but he did not seem to notice.

Finally, Julia made the effort to step forward even though it hurt and pulled Thelma with her. She called out to Tim and finally he turned around. It looked like Thelma was holding his left arm and Julia was holding his right. He stopped and stared at them, unable to believe what they were doing.

“Don’t come in here!” Thelma yelled at him",1
"With supplies running low and tensions high, the group must work together to find a way out before it's too late.","she knew it was
  for the best. They would all need to work together and leave these god-forsaken
  streets behind them.

 Later that day, Johnathan Hill arrived at the house with two men who were carrying
  bags full of food and medicine for him. He told them to give it all away to the
  others that were still trapped in this area. As a reward, he gave each of them a
  hundred dollars and said that if any of them needed anything else, they could
  come back.

 Johnathan’s generosity made Jennifer feel bad, like she was taking something from
  him and not giving him anything in return. There were many times while living in
  the streets where he had helped her out with food or medicine. He was a good
  man and he didn’t deserve to be stuck in this hell hole with them.

 That night, Jennifer lay awake thinking about what she was going to say to
  Johnathan when it came time for her to leave. She wanted to tell him how much
  she appreciated everything he had done for her, but he probably already knew.
  No matter what though, he was going to be upset that sheleft. It was best to
  just let the words come out naturally and hopefully her actions would speak loud
  enough for him to understand.

 Meanwhile, the others watched as Johnathan continued to bring in more and more
  people from out of town who needed help. The place had become a makeshift
  hospital and the people that were being brought in were getting better.

 As the days went by, Jennifer started to think less about leaving and more about
  how long they were going to stay here. The food and medicine were still coming
  in, but there would eventually be an end to it. Once it stops, there won’t be
  anyone left alive out there who can help them out anymore.

 She didn’t know what was going to happen after that, or what their plans were
  for escaping the city. It all depended on Johnathan and the others who were
  still out there fighting.

 There was only a few of them left that actually came back from Johnathan’s last
  mission to raid an army base camp. They were all good men and if anyone could
  get them out of this city alive, it would be them. The problem was theydidn’t
  have a plan and they didn’t know exactly where they were going to go.

 Everyone in the house was starting to get agitated because they knew that
  there wasn’t enough room for all of them. They had been staying in the house for
  almost two weeks and it was starting to feel cramped in there. They wanted to
  get out of the city and into a more open area where they could start building
  things up and making new lives for themselves.

 After another day of food and medicine coming in, Jennifer finally decided that
  she had to go back out there and meet Johnathan again. It was hard enough doing
  what she did before, but now she had to leave her home behind as well.

 She walked into the living room and found Willow sitting on the couch with her
  head down in her hands. Jennifer was about to walk past him without saying
  anything when he looked up at her. His eyes were red from the tears he had been
  crying and his face looked like he had been beaten up really bad.

 She waited patiently for him to get his composure back together before she
  asked him what was going on. He wiped awaythe tears that were falling down
  his face and stood up as he told her what happened. One of the kids from
  Johnathan’s group had cornered him in the alley one night and beat him up
  just because he was black. He said that every time he looked at Johnathan it made
  him sick to his stomach because he knew that Johnathan wasn’t helping all of
  them out of charity, but because he was a part of the same group as the people
  who did that to him.

 Jennifer didn’t know what to say or do after hearing what Willow said. She just
  put her hand on his shoulder and let him cry it out before she told him that
  things would get better.

 Willow sat in Jennifer’s lap for a while, holding onto her tighter than he had ever
  held anyone before. When he finally got up, Jennifer let out a big sigh of relief
  and told him that it was okay to cry sometimes. It was just the last thing that she
  expected to hear. Willow never let anyone see him cry before; he always kept his
  emotions locked up inside of him where no one could see them.“I’ll be fine,” he mumbled as he walked back over to the other side of the room
  to spend the rest of the night by himself.

 Jennifer knew that there was nothing she could do for Willow right now so she just
  went back to talking with Johnathan about their plans to leave. She was so excited
  about having a real life again that she had completely forgotten about Willow for
  now.

 Unfortunately, Johnathan had bad news for her. He told her that it was going to take a
  little longer than they originally thought because the supplies were too low and some
  of the people weren’t as willing to join their cause as he was hoping.

 “We’ll be alright,” Jennifer insisted while she looked at Johnathan with a look
  that said that she didn’t believe him.

 Johnathan could see the doubt in her eyes and he knew that there was no way
  they were going to make it in time to leave the city before another shipment of
  food came through the door. He told Jennifer that he had an idea and that it was
  going to take a lot of faith on her part",1
"Kyle Johnson, a man Aimee met at work, comes over to visit and the two quickly become friends.","the way she wanted them. It was a little strange since she had only moved in yesterday morning, but as she started to rummage through her suitcase in search of some clothes to change into while she was here, Aimee managed to convince herself that it wasn’t that odd after all and convinced herself that her new life in the city would be much better than the one she’d left behind.

	She closed the suitcase shut and threw it on the floor before looking around for something else to occupy her time while she waited for Kyle. She went through the closet first and pulled out a few outfits before hanging them up on the hangers. She decided to go with a simple pair of jeans and a light-blue blouse for now, but when Kyle arrived she would change into something sexier so that he would know he was wanted.

	There was no doubt in Aimee’s mind that Kyle Johnson could make her love him if he wanted to, but she wasn’t sure if he did want to or not. In any case, she would need to wait until after they had spent some time together before she made any sort of move on him because that would be too forward. For now though, it looked likeshe would have to entertain herself and get ready for work all at the same time.

	She went into the bathroom and brushed her teeth with a mouthwash that she had picked up from the drugstore earlier that day, and then she washed her face with some makeup remover wipes. She put on a little lip-gloss and some deodorant after that, but her hair was still wet from her shower so she decided to forgo putting anything else in it.

	It wasn’t too strange of an idea after all; there was something very relaxing about getting all dressed up in front of a full-length mirror while waiting for someone to arrive. If Kyle hadn’t been coming over, she might even have considered going out somewhere and having a night on the town by herself, but as it was she would just settle for doing things in front of her own one-way mirror.

	She smiled as she looked at herself and wondered what Kyle would think when he saw her, but the smile faded from her face when she realized that the chances of Kyle Johnson wanting anything to do with her were slim at best. She wasn’t his type; he probably liked his women more mature than Aimee was.Even though the couple of times they had been out together, he had seemed very interested in getting to know her better, Kyle was just being nice. He probably knew that she didn’t have many friends and wanted her to have a chance to get out on the weekends, where she could also be exposed to new people. He was that kind of a guy; the kind that was always looking out for other people even if it meant sacrificing his own personal life in the process.

	She had met him about two months ago now and, as far as anyone else in their circle of friends knew, they had been dating ever since. That hadn’t been a deliberate lie on either one of their parts; it had just simply happened like that; they always seemed to be hanging around together, even though they were never alone when everyone else was there, and so the word spread just by accident. It had only been a few times that they had even gone out on their own, once to see a movie at the theatre and then once for dinner afterwards. His behaviour had been completely appropriate and there had been no cause to think that he was interested in her in any way other than professionally.

	Aimee looked at her watch again and felt a rush of excitement as the hands ticked past the point that she had told Kyle to come over; he would be there any second now. She had been waiting for this moment all day and had been in a state of nervous excitement ever since lunchtime, but she was also a little bit disappointed at the thought that it might just be a one-night-stand this time. What else could it be?

	She had asked him to come over late tonight because she knew that they would both have had quite busy days at work, so they wouldn’t be able to stay up very late and might not even have much time together at all, but she also knew that once they were alone together, no matter how short their time might be, she would get exactly what she wanted. She had been hoping for something more permanent and more loving, of course, but circumstances had never seemed quite right until now; and so she was just going to have to appreciate what little time they did have together.

	She finished brushing her teeth, put on a dark blue blouse with thin straps over her shoulders and a white mini skirt, and then straightened the collar on her short-sleeved shirt before looking in the mirror. Slipping into a pair of sensible flat pumps, she made sure that everything was perfect before picking up her handbag and heading for the door. She stepped out intothe hallway and inhaled deeply, welcoming the fresh air and trying to steady her nerves.

	As she climbed out of the elevator and walked down the hallway towards her building’s main entrance, she felt a mild nagging sensation in the pit of her stomach indicating that there was something slightly wrong with this situation, but she dismissed it as a sign that it was just nerves on her part.

	She stopped at the front desk and pressed the call button on the phone there to ask for a visitor’s parking pass, but no one seemed to hear or came to help within a reasonable amount of time – at least not enough time for her to justify waiting any longer – so she walked past the desk and out into the lobby.

	She stood just outside the main entrance for several seconds, debating whether she should go inside or not to see if someone would answer. She had never had any problems with getting help at this building before, but then again it was late and she was clearly not at her most charming or graceful tonight. At last she decided to go inside and try one more time.

	She put her bag down on the ground by the main doors and looked around to make sure no one would notice, then quickly slipped in through a",0
"Kitty confronts Sergei and eventually solves the case, bringing the murderer to justice.","your help too!”

	Sergei nodded and said, “Of course! You know that I have solved many other mysteries in the past. I don’t mind helping!”

	Kitty nodded and turned her attention back to Betty who said, “Great! I will tell you everything my dog and I know about the other dog murders. It is very important that you catch the killer so this doesn’t happen again!”

	Sergei said, “Wait a minute – there are other dog murders? You never told us that before!”

	Betty said, “Yes! Not only do we have all these people killed here in our park, but there are also many other dogs killed all over town! There have been three other dogs murdered in the last few days! The first killing was right outside the pet store downtown! The second one was a few days after that – right outside the hardware store on Main Street. And now this one in our park!”

	Sergei nodded and said, “Well, I think we are getting somewhere with your case – it is always a good idea to try and solve any other mysteries in town while you aretrying to solve your own case. That way if you don’t find the killer, at least you will have helped our friends in other places!”

	Kitty said, “Well, I have an idea – why don’t we meet at the pet store tomorrow morning at ten o’clock? That way we can talk about all of these murders and see if we can find a connection between them all or something that will help us catch the killer!”

	Betty said, “Yes! I will be there to talk! Sergei – will you come too?”

	Sergei said, “Of course! I have much experience solving mysteries of this nature. I can be very helpful as well!”

	Harry Houndstooth and Lulu Laverne were listening in on this conversation, and Harry said to Kitty’s dog, “So now we have a chance to find out who has been killing all of the dogs! This is going to be fun!” Lulu Laverne was accompanied by her best friend Jose Cuervo, who was eager to help as well.

	Lulu Laverne said, “Yeah – this could be very interesting! Maybe I will get some more acting work to do if we can catch the killer!”Harry Houndstooth said, “Yes – this is going to be great! We’ll finally get some answers! And who knows what other mysteries we can solve while we are at it?”

	Kitty said, “Wonderful! I’ll see you all tomorrow morning at ten o’clock then. Oh – by the way – no dogs are allowed at this meeting. We need to keep it a secret from Sergei Snipe because he may be our suspect. This way he won’t try and kill any of us before we can figure out who the real killer is! Oh – and don’t tell my dad about this meeting either, Betty. He may get mad that I am working on this case with you guys and not him.”

	Betty said, “That is a good idea! See ya tomorrow, Kitty! And thanks for helping us solve this problem.”

	Kitty said, “No problem! I can sense that all of you are good people and I want to help as long as my dad doesn’t get mad about it. Good bye everyone, and see ya tomorrow at ten o’clock!”Sasha said, “Bye Kitty!”

	Betty said, “Bye Kitty!”

	Sasha said, “See ya tomorrow, Daddy! I love you!”

	Sergei Snipe said, “Ha – I will see you all tomorrow at ten o’clock sharp. And don’t be late or you will be a dead dog – hahaha!! Gotta go now. See ya later!”

	Kitty goes home and gets ready for bed. She turns on her TV to watch some news while she is getting ready for bed. She puts on her nightgown and lays in front of the TV with her blanket, pillow, and favorite teddy bear. She is watching the news when all of a sudden she sees her dad being arrested for murdering people. The news quickly cuts to Kitty doing a live report about how her dad killed the victims at the dog park!!

	Kitty said, “Good evening everyone! I am Kitty Pawsky and this is my live report on the arrest of my father, Sergei Snipe. This has got to be one of the hardest reports I have ever had to do in mylife. My father has been accused of killing five dogs at the park. I am so shocked right now because this is not like my dad at all!! My dad is very protective and loving towards all animals no matter what – even the ones he doesn’t know like me!! Could he really be guilty? I don’t know. But it is hard not to believe it because the police have evidence that incriminates Sergei!! It is too much for me to handle right now so I am going to end this report here and show you what we have on the footage. Goodbye everyone and good night!”

	The camera turns off. Kitty quickly gets up and grabs her iPad to search up any information on the murder of her father as well as any information on the dog park murders that she can find. She didn’t get far because her mom came into her room with a snack for Kitty after she finished watching news.

	Kitty said, “Hey mom! What are you doing home so late?”

	Her mom replied, “Oh, I guess you didn’t hear. Your dad has been accused of killing people at the dog park and he is being locked up in jail now.”

	Kitty gasped and said, “No way! That can’t be true! There is no way my dad could do something like that!”

	Her mom sadly said, “I’m afraid it is true Kitty. The police have evidence that incriminates your father. I’m so sorry.”

	Kitty couldn’t believe it. She didn’t want to believe it. But it was all too real. Her dad was a murderer.",0
Julia Martin starts to experience terrifying visions.,"Julia Martin lay in her bed. She was trying to calm down and slow her breathing. The images in her head were becoming clearer and clearer. She could see the townspeople as they walked about in their normal routine, going about their business. They looked pretty normal, but they were missing something that Julia couldn’t put her finger on, but she knew that she would know it when she saw.

She could see people walking by the grocery store, and suddenly a strange aura appeared around the door of the store. The aura was a very bright white light, and Julia found herself feeling afraid for no apparent reason. Julia started to feel a sense of dread, and she didn’t understand why. Her eyes started to tear up, and a lump formed in her throat. She felt scared, and she felt like she had to run away. She ran as fast as she could away from the grocery store, but  still she felt like something was coming after her.

The light from the grocery store seemed to follow Julia wherever she ran, always remaining just out of reach. The townspeople now seemed to be changing in Julia’s vision. She could see that they had begun a process of degeneration. The people around her were becoming more and more strange.

They were losing their bodies, and now they were nothing but gray masses, moving about the streets in a ghostly fashion. No longer did they have any discernible faces or bodies; all that she could see was a mass of moving gray clouds. They moved among the stores like a cloud of smoke, occasionally forming into a face or an animal and then dissipating again.

They seemed to be looking straight at Julia, but she couldn’t quite tell if they were even aware of her. They were moving in a very strange manner, with no apparent destination in mind. They glided from the streets into people’s homes and back again, making no sense whatsoever. Now the townspeople were trying to enter her own home.

As soon as they entered, they vanished, leaving behind only gray ash on the floor. She tried to close her eyes so that she might not be forced to look upon these bizarre ghosts, but she found that she was unable to.

She opened them again, and found herself staring at the entrance to her own home. In front of her was a young man with no face or body, who seemed to be holding an arm outstretched towards her. It was as if he were beckoning her to follow him, but there was nothing she could do. She had no legs with which to move, only a cloud of moving gray ash. Still, it appeared that whatever he was beckoning her to follow him into had a definite destination in mind; it wasn’t just wandering aimlessly through people’s homes.

More and more of these silhouettes started to appear before her. For some reason she did not question this occurrence; it was as if she had come to accept the fact that these ghosts would be coming into her house. They entered from every  side, and though they had no feet they were able to make their way through the floor as if it were water. They seemed to want not only to enter her house, but also to remain inside.

She could see them clearly now, because they had all taken on the gray color of her home. She saw that they were all people she knew in one form or another, and many of them had faces that had been torn apart or sliced off, a terrible sight. They didn’t seem to be aware of that, though; they simply stood there waiting for her to follow them into her home. She knew that she had to do it.

She was led into the living room, and saw that her house had been invaded by these gray silhouettes. At first she thought that they were looking at her, but then realized that they were all looking past her towards a house at the end of the street where a woman lived with her two children. The silhouettes were coming forward in a line, and they began to move towards the woman’s house.

Thelma Bates was now standing in front of Julia, and she was pointing to the house down the street. She could see the silhouette of Thelma become more distinct in the gray cloud that surrounded them both.

“That’s where it all starts to go awry. That’s where it begins, and then before you know it, the visions are everywhere. Each one more terrible than the last.” 

Thelma began to walk down the street towards the woman with her two children. Julia wanted to go and warn her, but she was unable to move from where she was standing. She tried to call out, but could not force any sounds out of her mouth. She could see Thelma walking slowly down the street with the other silhouettes in her wake. When Thelma reached the woman’s house, she gestured for Julia to follow her. This time, Julia was able to make sounds, and she began to yell at Thelma, “What are you doing?”

“We have to show them what’s going on. We can’t let them enter that house without knowing what they are getting into,” Thelma said as she turned to Julia.

Julia continued to yell, “But they will get hurt! And so will you!”

As much as Julia wanted to stop what was happening, she could not muster up the strength to move. She tried again to yell and move her body, but both were still impossible. She heard a door open and then the sound of footsteps on the floor of the house. The figure of the woman appeared at the window and began to stare at Julia and Thelma. She stared with such fright that it frightened Julia even more.

The figure of the woman slowly turned away from the window, but she did not enter the room. Instead, she raised her hand and began to hit herself in the face over and over again.

Julia tried to yell louder, but she was still entirely incapable of moving. She was glad that Tim was in the house with them, but he was too far away for her to call out loud enough for him to hear. She wanted to scream so that he would help her, but she was mute. Thelma had jumped back and was waving to get Tim’s attention, but he did not seem to notice.

Finally, Julia made the effort to step forward even though it hurt and pulled Thelma with her. She called out to Tim and finally he turned around. It looked like Thelma was holding his left arm and Julia was holding his right. He stopped and stared at them, unable to believe what they were doing.

“Don’t come in here!” Thelma yelled at him",1
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,"authors and musicians.

Aimee’s eyes lit up at being able to talk about books and movies with someone else who loved them as much as she did, but Kyle was having a hard time getting into it. He wanted to be listening and watching a movie at the same time, and he was finding it hard to do both at the same time.

Kyle Johnson took out a packet of candy from his jacket pocket and offered Aimee some. They sat in silence for a few moments while munching on their treats, each lost in their own thoughts. Aimee finally spoke. “I struggle with connecting to people,” she said. “There’s a lot of things I want to share about myself, but I don’t know who I can talk to about them. And sometimes I worry that no one will understand what I have to say.” 

Kyle was silent for a moment. “I know how that feels,” he said softly.

“It must be really difficult being in advertising,” Aimee said. “You have to deal with a lot of people all the time, and if you can’t connect with them… I just couldn’t do that. I would be terrible at it.”

“Like you said, it is a struggle,” Kyle said slowly. “And sometimes I wonder if it’s worth it. But then I feel selfish for  feeling that way because I do enjoy the job.” He paused and looked at Aimee, who was studying the TV intently. “But as you said, when it comes to life in general, I have a hard time connecting with people.”

Aimee glanced up at Kyle. She felt grateful to him for listening and not interrupting her. “I don’t mean this in a bad way, Kyle, but you seem like the kind of guy who doesn’t care about what people think of him. You never seem to  worry about what other people are thinking of you.”

Kyle nodded slowly. “I suppose that’s true, but I can sense when I’m being judged by other people, even if it’s not obvious. And it makes me feel alone in the world. It drives me nuts and sometimes I feel like I want to run away.”

Aimee felt a pang in her chest. She had never shared this feeling with anyone before, and she was startled to hear Kyle admit he felt the same way. Kyle seemed so calm and confident when he talked about his feelings. He really understood what Aimee was saying, which made her feel even more isolated from the world than before. She was still clutching her old teddy bear in her hands. “Sometimes I wish I could be like you, Kyle. Sometimes I feel like I’m stuck inside my own head and the world is a big scary place and I just want to hide under my bed or something. Sometimes I feel like when I’m alone, that no one really cares about me and it makes me sad.”",1
"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.","and we might be able to meet up more frequently. Do you want to go to NYC?”

Jenna shook her head in response as she replied, “If I go to Italy, I’ll have to talk with Antonia and Damian at some point. Why can’t I just go there and talk with them now?”

Liam shrugged his shoulders as he said, “I don’t know. She did say that you shouldn’t come back to the US for a while. This might have something to do with it. But if we don’t go, you won’t be able to help me in any way, because I can’t tell Antonia and Damian about being bitten by Dracula. Who knows what they are capable of doing?”

Jenna understood the danger that could be in store for Liam if he told anyone about his bite. She also knew that he was right – she wouldn’t be able to help him if she didn’t go to Italy. Getting back to her attacker was her only priority at this moment, and she had to do whatever it took. “Ok, I’ll go to NYC with you, but first we will have to talk with Randolph Howe. Once we are done, I’ll head off to Italy.”

Liam nodded in agreement as he said, “Deal!” Jenna was feeling happy that they were going to see Randolph Howe again; she liked him, and she trusted his knowledge of vampires.

They found the vampire community easily. It was still quite early when they arrived, so only a handful of people were walking about. Everybody seemed to be going about their business quietly and respectfully, which made for a very peaceful first impression. As they walked towards the community, Jenna felt a bit uneasy. It seemed like everyone had heard of her – there were many people looking at them as if they were some kind of celebrities.

It also seemed like everyone knew that she was missing, and had returned; most vampires around here looked surprised to see her. Some didn ’t seem as surprised, and Jenna recognized the looks on their faces. They were the faces of people who knew that she had been hurt, because they had been there when it happened.

Randolph was already sitting at his desk when they arrived at the community building, but he did stand up and greet Jenna. “Jenna, good to see you again!” He then reached out his hand to Liam. “And you must be Liam Cross?”

“Yes, sir, I am. I think we have met before?” Jenna noticed that Gregory Maldonado was sitting in the corner of the office, listening in.

“I don’t think so. But I do recognize you from pictures and stuff. You are Gregory Maldonado’s son, right?”

Gregory nodded quietly. “That is correct.”

Liam smiled at Gregory. It was a stiff smile, but he was trying to be polite. “Nice to meet you, sir.”

Gregory nodded back to him. “Likewise, Mr. Cross. Now, let us move into a private room; we can talk there.” Gregory Maldonado then stood up and gestured for them to follow him.

They moved into the next room, which was a rather large office with a large desk.

Gregory sat down behind the desk, and then gestured for them to sit across from him. “Now, let us move on to the reason why you are here. Jenna, I have heard through channels that you are trying to track down Gregory Maldonado’s son?”

“Yes sir, I am. He is guilty of several crimes that he has committed in Seattle and now in my  town. I want to know where he is so I can bring him to justice.”

Gregory Maldonado laughed quietly at her words. “Really? Do you truly think he will be brought to justice if you do find him?”

Liam was starting to get nervous at this conversation. It sounded like something was being set up here, but he didn’t know what it was.

Jenna gave Gregory an annoyed look. “I do, actually. I just need to find him first so that I can give the evidence I have to the FBI.”

“You are working for them now, and yet you want to turn your back on them? There is no need to do that. I have people that can help you track down his son, and then they will turn their attention to Antonia Rossi. She has a few people keeping an eye on the club tonight, but I am sure we can move it somewhere else for a night or two. But if we do that, then it would be better if we did it now, as opposed to later. If we wait too long, we will have a lot more eyes on us.

Liam was starting to get really nervous at this point. He moved a little closer to Jenna just in case he needed to shield her or something.

Jenna took a couple of seconds to think about this before speaking again. “Moving the club is okay with me, but moving it tonight might be a bad idea.”

“Moving it to somewhere safe is not a problem. Moving it to somewhere that our enemies can attack without fear of getting hurt would probably be a poor decision. Moving the club now might be an even worse idea though.”

This was starting to sound like moving the club was a bad idea no matter what.

Jenna looked over at Antonia. “Moving the club tonight is completely out of the question. We have a huge event tonight at Club Red, and everyone is looking forward to it. Why not move it to another club tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow night might be a better choice, anyway. If you move the club now, no one would know what or where the change was, and that could make matters even worse for you. You would then have to deal with the people who knew you might move the  club, as well as those who guessed right and chose to follow you there.”

Jenna looked at Antonia for a little while. This made sense, so she said, “I guess I could postpone the move until tomorrow. Yes, I will be sure that everyone knows what’s happening by the end of tonight.”

Antonia Rossi nodded a few times, and then said, “I would be happy to help with whatever you need when it comes to your attacker. I do not have much experience with that sort of thing, but I know others who may be able to help  me.”

Jenna sighed and said, “Okay. I appreciate that. But I have a feeling that the person who did this is going to be killed tonight, if they aren’t already.”

Antonia Rossi looked at Jenna for a long time and said, “What makes you think that? It seems that only Damian was seen leaving your alley, and he was arrested shortly thereafter.”

“I saw him leave my alleyway, but not after he assaulted me. He had a knife in his hand. I even got a good look at it, and I know that there’s no way that he could have killed me if he was holding it. He may have moved to the alleyway after he stabbed me, but did so much later. I’m not sure of the exact time frame, but it was definitely after the attack. And if he moved to my alleyway after the attack, then maybe he ran into Damian Henchman there, which is why he was arrested.”

Damian Henchman said, “Jenna, that is a possibility. Damian has already been questioned by the police about what happened to you. It is possible that they talked about moving to your alleyway. But why would you think that only one person was responsible for your attack?”

“Because I didn’t see anyone else that night. I didn’t hear anyone else, either. And I definitely didn’t feel anyone moving around me in the dark.”

Antonia piped up, “Jenna is right. She was moving around a lot with her superhuman speed and agility, and she would have noticed if someone was anywhere near her.”

“Well, I can tell you that someone was moving around, because I did feel something,” said Jenna. “But it was only one thing moving around me. For the most part, that thing just held still and waited for the right time to pounce. So I moved around a little bit myself to figure out what was going on, but then it moved in the same minute that I did. And then it just held still while I tried to fight back, and then it jumped on me, picked me up, and carried me away from wherever I was walking. Then it carried me over to the alleyway between your club and my apartment building. And then it  stabbed me, and I don’t really remember anything after that.”

Dread filled Jenna’s heart as she thought about everything she had been through. This was certainly the worst thing that had ever happened to her in her entire life, and yet it wasn’t even close to the worst attack that had been made against her.

All around them, everyone watched and listened intently.

“This is a very serious accusation you are making, Miss Riley,” said Judge White. “There is no proof that Damian Henchman is your attacker at all. You were found covered with blood in a back alley, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he attacked you there. In fact, it doesn’t even necessarily mean that he attacked you at all. The evidence will be presented tomorrow morning. Until then, Mr. Henchman will remain in custody here at the courthouse.”

Jenna nodded, and they exited the courtroom together. They moved to a separate room in the basement of the courthouse, a holding cell where they could speak privately and still be guarded by both security personnel and police officers. Judge White ordered security to escort both Jenna and Henchman into this room. They moved to the room, accompanied by four security guards and a detective who had worked on the case.

The courtroom was large and imposing. The holding cell was small and cramped. Jasper moved to one corner of it, opposite the door, while Damian moved to another corner opposite him. Jenna took up a position in the middle of the room, facing both men.

Jenna was standing very still, staring intently at Damian Henchman. It was clear that she had moved past being just angry to being downright furious with him now. She had stopped herself from attacking him, but only barely—she could feel that she was holding herself back by a thread of willpower alone.

Damian moved to the center of the room as well, facing Jenna. His face was clean-shaven now, and he did not look like himself at all. He looked smaller, more vulnerable than before. He moved to the center of the room, moving past a metal divider that separated Jenna from him.

Jenna moved to one side of the divider, away from Damian Henchman.

Damian looked at Jasper, then to one of the security officers in the room, gesturing with his head for them to leave. The security officer nodded and moved to the door, opening it and gesturing for the other three men to leave as well.

The detective lingered for a moment, looking first at Jenna, then at Damian. He hesitated, then moved to leave as well.

Jenna watched the men leave, then turned her attention back to Damian.

""You attacked me,"" she said, her voice low and dangerous. It was not a question.

Damian swallowed, but did not say anything. He looked away from Jenna's gaze.

""Why?"" Jenna asked. ""What did I ever do to you?""

Damian shook his head. ""You didn't do anything,"" he said. ""It wasn't personal.""

""Not personal?"" Jenna repeated, her voice incredulous. ""You nearly killed me, and you say it wasn't personal?""",1
The group of survivors must face the enemy and defeat him in order to survive in this new world.,"there was a small bullet hole in his pants and blood seeping out. The man tried to stand back up again, but he collapsed to his knees in agony as blood poured out of him onto the floor.

The man tried to turn himself over so he could see where the bullet had come from, but when he turned his head he saw that it was too late; there was the woman from before standing right in front of him with a gun pointed directly at him. As soon as she saw that he had seen her, she aimed the gun at him and pulled the trigger.

With a loud bang, the gun fired and the bullet hit the man in his chest. The man felt as though he had been punched in the chest by an angry giant, but this time he was able to fall over backwards onto the ground as he gasped for air. To make matters worse, it seemed that this time he wasn’t able to scream because there was a man standing over him with a large knife. He must have been hiding under one of those pieces of meat for awhile because he seemed to have just appeared out of nowhere, and now the man was standing above him with a very large knife that looked like it would be able to cut him in half atany moment.

The man tried to scream at the man with the knife, but he couldn’t get himself to move so his throat wouldn’t stop trying to scream. The blood from his chest wound kept pouring out as the knife slowly came down closer and closer to him.

As the second man stepped over his body, he could see that there were two other men standing in front of the woman; one was dressed like a priest and another was dressed in a pair of black leather pants and a white undershirt. The priest was holding something that looked like a large knife in one hand, but it was covered by some kind of thick cloth. The man could see that the other man had something in his hand too; he didn’t know what it was from this distance but he could tell that it was very dark colored.

The man had heard the stories about the priest being a saint before the end of the world, but this was not what he had pictured. He had always thought that the stories were meant to inspire hope and trust in people, but this definitely wasn’t either of those things. The man felt his heart start beating faster as he realized what was about to happen.The man with the knife slowly approached a still bleeding Johnathan and stopped right next to him. The man with the other weapon jumped over to the priest and pulled off the cloth from his weapon which turned out to be a very large machete.

The light from the fire made it easier for the man with the knife to see. The man was relieved by this because he didn’t know how much longer he could keep his eyes open; he only hoped that it wouldn’t be long before he finally died.

The woman watched as Johnathan tried to stand up and fight off the man with the machete but it was obvious that he was barely able to stand on his own two feet. She could see him putting up a good fight, but it also looked like someone had already stabbed him in the leg; there was too much blood for it to just be his chest wound.

The woman didn’t understand why this man had so much animosity towards Johnathan or why he felt that it was necessary for him to kill him. If she had learned one thing from traveling and living with different groups of people, it was that they all had their different rules and ways of doing things; she just hoped that thisman’s way of doing things wasn’t the same as those people.

For the most part, she liked being with this big group of people. It was nice knowing that there were so many people around her who were willing to protect her in case something happened to her and also be patient with her when she struggled learning a new skill or concept that was foreign to her.

There was one other thing that she liked being around so many people for, and that was because no matter what happened, someone would always be able to get her food or water when she needed it the most. All in all, as much as there were many things about them that were strange and different, she was glad that they had taken her into their group and allowed her to help protect them from other people who wanted to do them harm.

Johnathan tried harder than he ever had before, but it just wasn’t enough. The man came closer and swung his machete at Johnathan’s head. He didn’t miss and the machete went right through Johnathan’s skull killing him instantly. Johnathan slumped over onto the ground with blood pouring out of his head and onto the ground.As Johnathan fell to the ground, Jack came up behind him and pulled out his axe. There was a loud scream and then blood shot up into the air as the man stumbled backward from Jack’s axe which had gone through his chest. As soon as Jack saw what he had done, he ran to the unconscious Maria and knelt down next to her. Maria looked up at him and smiled weakly.

As Jack was tending to Maria, Jake pounced on the other man who was still standing there with his machete in his hand. This time, Jake sunk his teeth into the man’s stomach and ripped out a piece of flesh which caused him to scream in agony as he fell to the ground clutching his stomach. He then slowly got back up on his feet as he looked around frantically for help or something that might help him stop the pain.

He glanced over at Jack who was holding a bloody towel on Maria’s wound, and then looked at Jake who was growling and drooling with saliva coming out of his mouth. The man then turned around to face the priest who was still praying for forgiveness for the people that had been killed by Jack and Jake. He raised his machete up in Jack the air and then brought it down on the priest’s head, killing him instantly.

And with that, the group of survivors had finally defeated their enemy. They had fought and killed Ratzinger Kugelman and his men, and now they were the only ones left alive in this new world. They had won the battle, but the war was far from over. There would be other enemies to face and other challenges to overcome, but they would do it together. They were a team, and they would stick together no matter what happened.",1
"Kitty confronts Sergei and eventually solves the case, bringing the murderer to justice.","your help too!”

	Sergei nodded and said, “Of course! You know that I have solved many other mysteries in the past. I don’t mind helping!”

	Kitty nodded and turned her attention back to Betty who said, “Great! I will tell you everything my dog and I know about the other dog murders. It is very important that you catch the killer so this doesn’t happen again!”

	Sergei said, “Wait a minute – there are other dog murders? You never told us that before!”

	Betty said, “Yes! Not only do we have all these people killed here in our park, but there are also many other dogs killed all over town! There have been three other dogs murdered in the last few days! The first killing was right outside the pet store downtown! The second one was a few days after that – right outside the hardware store on Main Street. And now this one in our park!”

	Sergei nodded and said, “Well, I think we are getting somewhere with your case – it is always a good idea to try and solve any other mysteries in town while you aretrying to solve your own case. That way if you don’t find the killer, at least you will have helped our friends in other places!”

	Kitty said, “Well, I have an idea – why don’t we meet at the pet store tomorrow morning at ten o’clock? That way we can talk about all of these murders and see if we can find a connection between them all or something that will help us catch the killer!”

	Betty said, “Yes! I will be there to talk! Sergei – will you come too?”

	Sergei said, “Of course! I have much experience solving mysteries of this nature. I can be very helpful as well!”

	Harry Houndstooth and Lulu Laverne were listening in on this conversation, and Harry said to Kitty’s dog, “So now we have a chance to find out who has been killing all of the dogs! This is going to be fun!” Lulu Laverne was accompanied by her best friend Jose Cuervo, who was eager to help as well.

	Lulu Laverne said, “Yeah – this could be very interesting! Maybe I will get some more acting work to do if we can catch the killer!”Harry Houndstooth said, “Yes – this is going to be great! We’ll finally get some answers! And who knows what other mysteries we can solve while we are at it?”

	Kitty said, “Wonderful! I’ll see you all tomorrow morning at ten o’clock then. Oh – by the way – no dogs are allowed at this meeting. We need to keep it a secret from Sergei Snipe because he may be our suspect. This way he won’t try and kill any of us before we can figure out who the real killer is! Oh – and don’t tell my dad about this meeting either, Betty. He may get mad that I am working on this case with you guys and not him.”

	Betty said, “That is a good idea! See ya tomorrow, Kitty! And thanks for helping us solve this problem.”

	Kitty said, “No problem! I can sense that all of you are good people and I want to help as long as my dad doesn’t get mad about it. Good bye everyone, and see ya tomorrow at ten o’clock!”Sasha said, “Bye Kitty!”

	Betty said, “Bye Kitty!”

	Sasha said, “See ya tomorrow, Daddy! I love you!”

	Sergei Snipe said, “Ha – I will see you all tomorrow at ten o’clock sharp. And don’t be late or you will be a dead dog – hahaha!! Gotta go now. See ya later!”

	Kitty goes home and gets ready for bed. She turns on her TV to watch some news while she is getting ready for bed. She puts on her nightgown and lays in front of the TV with her blanket, pillow, and favorite teddy bear. She is watching the news when all of a sudden she sees her dad being arrested for murdering people. The news quickly cuts to Kitty doing a live report about how her dad killed the victims at the dog park!!

	Kitty said, “Good evening everyone! I am Kitty Pawsky and this is my live report on the arrest of my father, Sergei Snipe. This has got to be one of the hardest reports I have ever had to do in mylife. My father has been accused of killing five dogs at the park. I am so shocked right now because this is not like my dad at all!! My dad is very protective and loving towards all animals no matter what – even the ones he doesn’t know like me!! Could he really be guilty? I don’t know. But it is hard not to believe it because the police have evidence that incriminates Sergei!! It is too much for me to handle right now so I am going to end this report here and show you what we have on the footage. Goodbye everyone and good night!”

	The camera turns off. Kitty quickly gets up and grabs her iPad to search up any information on the murder of her father as well as any information on the dog park murders that she can find. She didn’t get far because her mom came into her room with a snack for Kitty after she finished watching news.

	Kitty said, “Hey mom! What are you doing home so late?”

	Her mom replied, “Oh, I guess you didn’t hear. Your dad has been accused of killing people at the dog park and he is being locked up in jail now.”

	Kitty gasped and said, “No way! That can’t be true! There is no way my dad could do something like that!”

	Her mom sadly said, “I’m afraid it is true Kitty. The police have evidence that incriminates your father. I’m so sorry.”

	Kitty couldn’t believe it. She didn’t want to believe it. But it was all too real. Her dad was a murderer.",0
"Shannon's father dies and her first book fails, leading her to doubt her talent.","Shannon took a drag from her cigarette and exhaled her smoke into the cold night air. Her house was quiet now; she had finished unpacking everything and had spent the evening hours reading in her room. It was only ten o’clock, but Shannon knew she would be unable to fall asleep tonight. She knew this because this wasn’t the first time she had lost someone close to her.

Shannon was twenty-two years old but already had experienced more heartbreak than most people do in their entire lives. First, her mother left when she was two years old and later on it was her biological father who decided that he didn’t want anything to do with her anymore. Then, when Shannon was nineteen, her adoptive father had died of a heart attack at the age of forty-four. Three months later, Shannon found out that she had been rejected from Columbia and instead was accepted into NYU.

Although Shannon didn’t want to admit it, being rejected from Columbia had made her feel like a failure. Her father’s death just compounded the problem. She felt like people would always expect her to fail at everything she tried to do. Shannon knew that eventually she would get over the rejection, but she didn’t know how long it would take.

She had been forced to find a job in order to provide her own support, so that meant she hadn’t been able to spend all of her time writing. After trying for several weeks to write and coming up empty-handed, Shannon wasn’t sure if she would ever be able to write again. Her agent, Samantha Shaw, had warned her to give herself some time and suggested that Shannon start working on another book. Although it hadn’t been too long since she finished her first one, she figured it was worth a shot.

For the past couple of months, all Shannon had done was read other people’s books and pretend that they were stories about herself. This was hard for her because it made her feel as if she couldn’t think up new ideas of her own – which was something that she did all the time when she wrote short stories as a kid. Shannon doubted whether or not she would be able to write anything again, but luckily it wasn’t long before something started happening.

One morning, while Shannon was flipping through a magazine, an idea popped into her head and wouldn’t leave her alone untilshe began writing it down. This time, the ideas were coming to her more quickly than ever before. The more she thought about them, the easier it got for her to put words on paper. Writing the book took much less time than she was expecting, and soon she had finished the first draft of what would become her second novel. Shannon was happy with how it turned out, but she wasn’t sure if she should show it to anyone yet.

The only people who had read her first book were friends and family members, though Samantha Shaw had helped her get it published. Samantha had also been helping Shannon secure movie rights to the book, but so far there hadn’t been any interest in it by anyone in Hollywood. Recently, Shannon had spoken to one of her professors about selling movie rights, and he told her that unless your first book is a best-seller, it will be difficult to get movie rights for subsequent books. She was pretty pissed off with him for telling her that because he didn’t know anything about the movie business.

Shannon knew she had to show someone her second novel right away, but she wasn’t sure who. Samantha Shaw was the only other person who had read both of her novels, and Shannon didn’t want to pressure her into giving an opinion about it. She didn’t know if she could handle hearing negative feedback after all of the struggles she had gone through getting people to read her first book. Besides, Sam was a busy woman and she might find it very difficult to actually give Shannon any feedback on her work.

Shannon was also thinking about Luke Saunders. He had told Shannon that he would help her get movie rights for her book, but he had yet to do anything about it. In fact, Shannon hadn’t heard from Luke in almost a month. She was feeling a little bitter about that because he had promised to help her and he hadn’t followed through. However, Shannon didn’t want to be rude and just stop taking his calls completely because he was still a nice guy, even if he wasn’t being very helpful at the moment.

Shannon eventually decided that the best person to read her new novel was Abby Fuller. She knew that Abby would give her an honest opinion and there were likely to be no hard feelings if she didn’t like it. Abby had been one of Shannon’s best friends for almost ten years now, so she knewthat Abby wouldn’t hold back just because she didn’t want to hurt Shannon’s feelings.

Shannon sent Abby an email inviting her to lunch at a little café near NYU, and she waited outside of the café for a few minutes until Abby showed up. When Abby arrived, Shannon pointed out that they had been friends for a long time so they should be honest with each other. However, Shannon also wanted Abby to know that no matter what might happen, they would still both be her friends.

They got into the café and ordered some sandwiches. Shannon told Abby about what had happened in the past few months and she seemed genuinely sympathetic toward her struggles. For most of their lunch, the two women talked about normal things such as what was going on in their lives and any plans that they had for the weekend. But then Shannon changed the subject slightly by telling Abby about her new novel.

Shannon explained that she was really happy with it and she thought it might be her best work yet. However, she also said that she didn’t feel ready to share it with anyone else yet because she wasn’t sure how they would react. She was worried that they wouldn’t like it or that they",1
"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","Three weeks ago

Jenna Riley woke up in a cold sweat, her face damp with tears. Her heart was racing and her body shaking uncontrollably. She groaned and rolled over onto her side, cradling a pillow against her chest as she tried to calm down. Jenna had been having these nightmares for weeks now. Sometimes they were about the accident, but more often than not they were about being murdered. At first she thought that it was just an overactive imagination brought on by the accident, but the dreams kept getting worse and more detailed every time she had one. She wished that she could remember what they all meant.

Her cell phone, sitting on the bedside table, began to ring. When she saw the number flash up on the screen, her heart skipped a beat. It was her mom calling to check on her progress after Jenna had called in sick again from work. She didn’t want to get out of bed and talk to her mom, but it would be too embarrassing when she found out that she hadn’t called in sick.

Jenna groaned and put the pillow over her head as she picked up the phone. “Hi Mom,” Jenna said with a groggy voice.

“Hey honey, how are you feeling today?” Her mother asked.

“I don’t know what I have, but I feel like crap. Did you call work?” Jenna asked.

Her mother sighed. “No honey, I told them that you must have caught the worst cold in history. This place will fall apart without you there to run it,” her mother said lovingly.

Jenna laughed dryly and sighed loudly into the phone. “Mom, I can’t go to work today and I probably won’t be able to go tomorrow either. I just need to rest, that’s all. You can do everything at home just as good as I can,” Jenna said quietly.

Her mother sounded disappointed but understanding when she asked, “Are you really sick or are you just hung over from last night?”

Jenna rolled her eyes. “Mom, I don’t drink anymore. Look, I have to go now okay? Love you too.” Jenna hung up the phone and threw the covers off her body. Her head throbbed loudly and she felt nauseous whenshe stood up. She decided to take a shower, hoping that maybe it would help her headache to subside a little.

Jenna stepped into the shower and turned on the water, letting it run over her body slowly as she tried not to think about anything painful. The water was nice and warm on her body; it relieved some of the pain in her head. She closed her eyes and let the warm water run over her face; she felt so frustrated that she couldn’t remember what happened last night. She knew that a lot of bad things had happened, but all she could think about was what caused them.

“Gregory!” she screamed at the top of her lungs. She couldn’t understand why he had done it again; why he had almost killed her. He looked at her with a slight amount of concern, but there was also a glint in his eye that warned Jenna to not test him. She realized that he was going to punish her one way or another for disobeying him, so silently she stepped out of the shower and dried off. She then walked into the bedroom where Gregory stood waiting for her.

When he saw her, his smile widened and he said, “I’m glad that you were able to wake up so soon.”

Jenna looked down at the floor and answered timidly, “I-it wasn’t easy. My head hurts a lot.”

Gregory nodded in approval of her response. He walked over to the nightstand and picked up a bottle of pills. He turned around and walked back toward Jenna, holding out the pills he had taken out while he said in a gentle voice, “They should make you feel better.”

Jenna stared at the pills that were being held out to her, but she didn’t want them. She knew that they would make her forget what had happened last night. Then she would have no way of protecting herself from him if he attacked her again in the future.

“No, thank you,” she said firmly as she turned away from Gregory and put on her clothes.

Gregory turned back to the nightstand as if he hadn’t heard her response and popped another pill into his mouth. He then took a drink of water before turning back to Jenna and asking politely, “Breakfast?”Gregory hoped that food might provide her with the energy she would need to deal with him. He knew that he could no longer keep her locked away in their bedroom all day. She needed to spend some time outside of the bedroom so that her memory wouldn’t be as clear of what had happened to her. Gregory could see it in her eyes—the fear and the pain were now starting to fade from them. She was starting to accept what had happened as if it were her fault for having disobeyed him in the first place.

To keep her mind off of everything that had happened, Gregory wanted to take Jenna out and buy her a new outfit. He wanted her to go out into the world like normal people so that she would be able to remember how it felt again. The problem was that he didn’t have any money to do anything like that, not without telling Antonia where he got it from.

Gregory knew that his wife wouldn’t approve of what he was doing, but he didn’t care. He was worried that Jenna would start remembering what had happened to her and would end up telling someone else about it. It was better for Gregory if Jenna forgot every detail of what had happened,",0
The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,". “Just stay in the hall!”

Tim was frozen with fear and confusion. “What are you doing?” he asked quietly.

Julia took a deep breath and turned to Thelma. “Please get me out of here,” she said with difficulty, her voice barely audible. “I think that I’m going to be sick.”

Thelma nodded and reached for the door, but a loud crashing noise made her freeze in her tracks. Julia had turned around and saw the large dark figures moving towards them. It did not quite look like they were moving, but more like they were flowing. Then the other door opened and the little girl came walking slowly into the room.

“I am here with your doctor,” she said calmly and smiled at Julia. “He says that he will be able to help you relax and get your thoughts and feelings in order.”

Thelma moved quickly to the girl’s side and forced her back out of the door. She turned around to face the doctor.

“What are you doing here? Why are you treating my daughter this way? Why can’t I come in there with her?”

The doctor looked around the room, as if searching for an answer. He found none and started to move towards the door. “I need to talk to the patient alone, Mrs. Bates. Please wait in the hallway and out of sight until I call you back in.”

The doctor moved to the door and held it open, but Thelma had moved out of his way. She stood calmly in front of him, blocking his exit.

“No sir. You will not move from this office until you explain your intentions to this young lady and me and our doctor.”

The doctor seemed to stare at her for a full minute before he spoke again. “Are you the patient’s mother?”

She nodded.

“Do you believe your daughter needs medical or psychiatric treatment?”

Thelma moved her head slowly in a nod and waited for the doctor to speak. His voice was very calm and monotone as he replied, “I believe your daughter may need medical treatment, but not psychiatric therapy at this time. I recommend that she be seen at the local hospital , where we can give her medical attention and keep her under sedation until the medication starts to take effect.”

Thelma pulled her body straighter and showed no emotion on her face. “We will provide those services here, Doctor.”

The doctor shook his head slowly. “I cannot recommend that course of action. I believe it would be in the best interest of your daughter for her to be seen by a specialist at the hospital in Raleigh.”

Thelma nodded slowly and lowered her head.  “You will cooperate with us, Doctor. If you don’t, I will have you dismissed from this hospital and never allow you to practice medicine again in this county. I am an officer of the law and know how these matters are handled.”

Timothy Jenks stood and walked swiftly to the door. He opened it and stepped out into the hall. Thelma followed quickly. “Come with me, young lady,” she said as she led Julia out the door.

Thelma walked silently down the corridor and stopped in front of a closed door. They turned to look at Julia. She was trembling on the verge of panic. “Don’t worry, honey. It will be okay,” Thelma said as she entered the room and closed the door behind her. She walked to the bed and sat on the edge beside Julia.

Julia looked up at Thelma and started to cry. “What are they going to do with me, Mama?”

Thelma’s expression changed from one of seething anger to that of a loving mother. She walked slowly to Julia, put her arms around her, and held her close. “Oh, honey. I’m sorry. They are not going to do anything except listen to you and help you get well.”

“They? What do you mean? You mean they will just listen to me talk about this stuff? That’s all? ”

As she spoke, Thelma realized that Julia was thinking of going to a psychiatrist. She was relieved that the town doctor refused to heed Thelma’s request. Now, looking into her daughter’s face, she could see the fear and uncertainty that Julia was facing. “Yes, honey. They will listen to you and—“

Suddenly there was a sound at the door. Thelma turned and saw Karen Jones standing in the doorway of the bedroom. “The doctor wants to talk to you, Dr. Martin. They moved up your appointment.”

Thelma turned back around to face Julia and continued, “They moved up your appointment because I insisted they do so.” She smiled reassuringly at her daughter and then added, “They are going to  help you get well and I am sure everything will be fine.”

Julia hesitated, then asked, “So why are you crying?” Thelma turned away as the tears streamed down her face. Julia looked at Karen for understanding, but she had already gone back into the kitchen.

In the next few minutes, it became clear to Julia that more than one person in town was disturbed by the recent events. First, Julia’s friends avoided her, and when she spoke to them on the telephone they had little to say about anything. Then, one day a group of high school girls came by Julia’s house and began screaming at her.

“You are possessed by the devil! Get out of town! Go away! We don’t want you here anymore! Get out of town or we will kill you!” Julia was taken completely by surprise her and did not know how to react. She began crying uncontrollably.

Thelma came running out of the house with a pan in her hand, screaming at the girls to leave her daughter alone. Thelma then turned her attention back to Julia and said, “Julia, I’m so sorry. Please don’t cry. Just leave when you can and never come back here again. Please stop crying Julia, for my sake if not your own.”

Julia stood outside her house, crying and listening to the screams of the girls moving up the street. Finally, Julia left her house and ran as fast as she could into town. She ran until she could no longer run. She found herself at the town square, collapsed on the grass crying and gasping for air. She was breathing so heavily that it was difficult for her to speak, but Julia managed to say, “I don’t know what’s happening to me. I don’t think I can stay here anymore. Please help me! Please do something! Please make this stop!”

Julia did not know what else to say. She was exhausted and out of breath. Julia felt alone and scared. Julia sat in the town square, surrounded by trees and empty benches, and cried. Julia cried because she was scared, because she felt alone, because she did not know how to fix what was happening to her, and because she just did not want to feel this way",1
"Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.","sat next to her in the darkroom and she stroked his hair and kissed him until he fell asleep.

    	Jack woke up in the early morning hours and tiptoed back to bed. Eliza was still sleeping, so he dressed quietly and walked out into the rain to get some fresh air. The street lights shone brightly through the misty rain as he made his way down the street towards town.

As Jack walked, he thought about his grandfather’s death and how it had affected him, especially now that Eliza was dead, too. His father had told him that his grandfather had been sick for a while before he died. Even though he knew this, Jack couldn’t help thinking of all the things they might have done together if his grandfather hadn’t gotten sick- the walks in the woods, fishing trips, and all the other things they used to do together.

Jack reached town just as it started to get light out. The streets were empty except for a few people hurrying into shops and restaurants, getting ready for another day at work or school. From this distance, he could see that all of the restaurants on Main Street were closed up for good. He could see a smallgroup of men gathered on the corner, drinking coffee together while they waited for their chance to head out to the ocean and start their fishing day.

Jack turned around and walked back home. When he reached the house, he saw that everything was dark. It was still raining outside, too hard for anyone to be outside. He couldn’t see Eliza in the living room or the bedroom, so he went upstairs to look in on her. He slowly opened her bedroom door and tiptoed inside.

Eliza’s side of the bedroom was painted blue while his side was pink. The walls were covered with pictures of her family and friends, most of them smiling but some of them with tears running down their faces. Jack looked at all of these pictures, remembering them as if they were his own memories.

The room smelled strongly of Eliza’s perfume. When he opened the closet door, it smelled even stronger. He leaned over Eliza’s dresses and gently touched her wedding dress, which hung on the back wall of the closet. It still had her name on it in white embroidery thread.

He glanced around one more time and then left the room. He walked down the stairs andwent into the living room, where he saw Eliza sitting cross-legged on the floor with her knees drawn up to her chest. She was rocking back and forth.

Jack sat down next to her on the floor, leaned over, and held her hands in his. He gently shook them. “Eliza?” he said softly. Still, she didn’t answer him. Jack sat there for a long time rocking back and forth with Eliza, not really knowing what to do or what to say. Everything he said felt wrong- it was almost as if she would answer him back if he spoke loud enough or long enough. Jack began to notice that there was a smell of alcohol in the room, and he wondered where Adam Wilson got it from.

Adam came in through the front door with a bottle of liquor in his hand, sloshing it as he walked. When he saw Jack on the floor holding Eliza’s hands, he frowned and walked across the room to them. He looked at both of them for a moment and then sighed before taking another swig from the bottle.

 “How is she doing?” Adam asked finally.

Jack didn’t reply at first, soAdam looked over at Eliza. She was rocking back and forth in the same pattern that Jack had been doing.

“Okay, I guess,” Jack said finally.

Adam nodded, but then suddenly asked out of nowhere, “Do you want me to stop seeing her?”

Jack felt his jaw drop as he struggled to find the words. “I- I don’t know what to say. It isn’t my business anymore. It was never really my business, but it was my wife.”

Adam laughed bitterly and shook his head before taking another drink of the liquor. “Never your wife, Jack. She never loved you like you thought she did.”

Jack felt anger rise up in his throat, but he swallowed it down and nodded. He had heard this a million times already and he didn’t know what to say about it anymore. Jack stood up and walked out of the room so that Adam could talk to Eliza alone- this was their business now, not his. Adam had been crying, but when he saw Jack going out of the room, they stopped. He said something about watching over her while Jack was gone.Jack nodded and left.

    The next day, people came to see him to give their condolences. They talked for a while about how much Eliza had meant to them. Jack started drinking heavily after they left because he couldn’t be bothered with conversations like that. The only person who didn’t leave was Abbie, and she asked if she could tell him a story. Jack nodded and listened with half an ear as she talked about her life with her wife before she died- how they met, how they fell in love, etc… She told him that it hadn’t been easy for them at all and that there had been times when they thought about calling it quits. She said that the pain and sorrow never fully left them until she passed away.

  Eventually, Abbie finished and asked Jack if he wanted to hear another story or if there was anything else she could do for him. Jack said that he would like another story, but the only thing that Jack really wanted was to forget everything that had happened.

Eliza sat on the ground rocking back and forth. She would still talk sometimes, but it was in a mumble when she did. Her eyes would flicker open and close slowly as if she was trying to stay awake but couldn’t.",0
Julia finally learns the truth about the visions.,"guilty?”

Julia sobbed as she stumbled back towards her bedroom. She could no longer hold back her tears as she cried, “I know that I was right to stay at home, but now I am scared to go out again! It doesn’t matter how many times you tell me I am safe, I don’t know if you are telling the truth!”

Julia sobbed again as she fell onto the bed and wept loudly into her pillow. She tried to block out all of the negative thoughts that were going through her head and shouted aloud, “I have to get these things out of my mind! I can’t sleep with them in there anymore!”

She lay on the bed sobbing as she thought about her dreams. Then, she gradually started to calm herself down and fell into a restless sleep. In her dream, she saw a man who appeared to be walking through the town square. She suddenly realized that it was in fact the same man that she had seen in her visions.

The man walked through the town square with a grim look on his face as he passed by the statue of Lord Byron on his way down to the river. He walked right past the town hall and into a small alleyway that led to the back of the shops.

At this point in the dream, Julia started moving towards the town square. She followed after the tall, dark-haired man. The man walked along a small wooden bridge that ran over the river and down into town. The path led right through the center of town and into what appeared to be an old, abandoned building. It was covered in ivy and moss and looked to be on the verge of collapse. The bricks were cracked and peeling away from the walls of it, but one could still see faint outlines of pictures on the wall.

The town square at night.

Julia moved to the edge of the town square and looked down into the alleyway below her. She could see dim lights dancing around in the dark and hear distant sounds of people talking and laughing. She moved to look around the town square, but there was no sign of the townspeople.

Just then a small, dark-haired girl walked out from one of the shops on the town square wearing a white nightgown and holding a lantern over her head to light her way. She carried herself with an air of confidence as she walked down the steps  into the darkened town square.

When Julia realized that she had been seen, she ran away from the dark-haired girl and into the dark building. She looked around for something to defend herself with. The only thing she could see before her was a hammer hanging on the wall in front of her. It was so dirty and worn that it looked like it had been there since the building had last been used.

As Julia turned to go back out into the town square, she heard footsteps behind her and turned around to see who was coming. When she did, something jabbed her in the back and knocked her to the ground. Before she could get up, someone was kneeling on top of her pinning her down. She wrapped her arms around the person’s legs and tried to kick them off of her, but she couldn’t free herself from the grip on her arms.

The figure on top of her was Timothy Jenks. Timothy looked down at Julia and smiled mockingly. “So, you decided to come back out after all?” he asked triumphantly. Julia stared at him blankly for a moment, but then suddenly a look of realization flashed across her face.

Julia was suddenly overcome with a feeling of rage, and she swung her fists around wildly while trying to kick Timothy at the same time. Suddenly, Tim let go of her and jumped away from her on the ground as if he had been burned. He sat on the ground for a second holding his hand to his cheek, looking into the air. When he looked back down at Julia, there was a look of cold fury in his eyes that she hadn’t seen before.

He took a step towards her and pointed his finger at her in accusation. “You think you can just come into my town and screw with everyone’s minds with these visions? You know they’ve almost killed Karen? And your little sister has been crying herself to sleep for weeks now? You think we’re just going to let you get away with that? You have no idea who you’re messing with. Julia!”

Julia suddenly snapped out of her rage and looked at him in surprise. “What do you mean, what do I mean? What do you think I mean? Do you assume that I am one of your little townspeople who can have its mind changed by some stupid vision?  I came here to tell you the truth about the visions and about what they are doing to my family and to Karen. But I was wrong, you don’t want to know the truth. You never wanted to know the truth, and you never will. You are just a puppet following orders like everyone else in your town.”

At this, she turned around to leave, but she stopped and turned back to face them all. “Let me tell you something about the visions. They are not real! I don’t even know what they mean. I have no idea who is generating them or why  they would want to. But you do not see the horrors that I see. You do not feel the horror as I feel it, and there is no way that I can explain what the visions mean to someone like you. Because someone like me can only understand through experiencing them myself.”

She paused for a moment, and then continued. “Do you know what they look like? Do you know what the pictures that I see look like?”

The townspeople stared at her in surprise, and some started to laugh nervously.

“Don’t worry, I don’t blame you for not knowing what they look like. They are so horrible and full of pain that no one should ever have to see them.”

At this point, Julia looked at Karen Jones and said “I am going to apologize to this woman.”

Julia left the townspeople and walked over to Karen.

“Karen?”

“Yes, Julia?” replied Karen with a stern frown.

“This is the first apology that I have ever given in my life, but I would like to apologize for the pain that I have caused you. I know that you blame me for the visions, and I am sorry.”

Karen was taken aback by Julia’s apology, and she hesitated for a moment before responding.

“Thank you, Julia. I appreciate your apology.”

Julia nodded and turned to walk back to the townspeople. As she did, she heard Timothy Jenks call out to her.

“Julia! Wait!”

Julia stopped and turned to face him.

“Yes, Timothy?”

“I wanted to apologize to you for what happened. I was part of the group that attacked you, and I am sorry. I hope that you can forgive me.”",1
"Kitty begins her investigation by speaking to the various dogs in the park, but none of them seem to be very helpful.","the murders and offered to investigate. Captain Kiddo agreed that Kitty might be able to help him solve the case, and asked her what she had in mind.
  “Why don’t you start by interviewing the other dogs?” he asked Kitty. “They might know more about it than we do.”
  “Good idea Captain Kiddo!” said Kitty.
  Kitty knew exactly where to start as she knew some of the dogs that had been murdered, so she went to speak with them.
  The first dog she went to see was Roger Regal, the small white Poodle who was usually near the park’s entrance. Kitty found him sitting in a corner and looking very forlorn. She sat down next to him and asked, “What’s the matter Roger?”
  “It’s dark,” he replied nervously. “I’m scared of the dark. Please move over there, it’s too close. Please, move over there further away from me.”
  Kitty moved further away from Roger and asked him again what the matter was.
  “I don’t know!” he wailed. “It’s dark and I just don’t like it! Move further away from me! I need to sit somewhere where the sun is shining, not where it’s so dark. Move further away, please move further away from me. Please move further away from me. Move, I said move!”
  Kitty moved as far away from Roger as she could, which was a bit of a problem because there were very few places for her to move to in the shade of the huge trees surrounding the park. She decided that moving further away was going to be important, so moved away from the fountain and toward the field that had signs saying “No Dogs Allowed” posted all over it.
  Moving away from Roger seemed to help him calm down a little bit, and he asked, “Is the park closed? Is that why you moved here? Are you moving to a new park? Oh, wait; there aren’t any other parks around here at all. No parks! No parks! No parks! Move, I said move! I want to sit in this nice sunny spot where the sun is shining and not in this dark place with no sun in it at  all.”
  Kitty had never seen Roger act like this before, and since he seemed to be afraid of the dark she moved further away from him. She didn’t really feel like sitting in the field where there wasn’t any grass and no trees, so she sat down on a bench near the entrance to the park, looking around for someone who might be able to tell her more about what was going on. She started talking to a large black dog who claimed to be named Simon Bones, but Simon seemed to think that he was actually a Skeleton Dog. He said that he lived in the park and told her that he was afraid of something. Roger Regal was still sitting at the spot where she had been before, barking things like “There is no sun! There isn’t any sun! There is no sun at all!” over and over again. 
“Do you know what is going on?” Kitty asked the Skeleton Dog.
Simon shook his head, “No, I was very young when I moved here, and I never really got to know anyone because I was always so frightened of everyone. You see, everyone here is afraid of a thing that lives in the park, but I don’t know what it is or what it looks like. I just know that it scares everyone, even me. That’s why I keep moving around. But for some reason no one has ever asked me about the thing that is in the park whenever they ask about the dark.”
“What does it look like?” Kitty asked, then immediately regretted it when Simon’s jaw dropped open and he started to shake. “I mean, does it have fur or scales or feathers or anything? What does it look like?” Kitty asked again, but Simon did not answer.
“What about the Skeleton Dog who is your brother? Does he know what the thing is?” Kitty asked, but Simon only shook his head once more. “Does he know anything at all? Has anyone ever talked to him about  it?” Kitty asked, but still Simon did not answer. Kitty decided she would have to ask Jose Cuervo about the thing that everyone was afraid of in the park.
As she walked up to Jose Cuervo, Kitty noticed that he was holding a bottle of tequila that looked like it was filled with Jose Cuervo. “Hey, Jose Cuervo! What is the thing that keeps all the dogs in this park hiding under their owners’ legs whenever they hear something rustling through the bushes? What is it?” Kitty asked as loudly as she could manage. She then held her ears and braced herself for Jose Cuervo to start barking at her, but instead he just grinned and said, “It’s a cat.”
Kitty gasped and stared at Jose Cuervo in disbelief. “But cats are my friends! We play together all the time! Jose Cuervo, you are making a terrible mistake! You are making false accusations about a cat who is my friend! You must apologize to me right now, or I will have to tell you what a bad dog you are and how scared of dogs you should be all the time! How scared of cats should you cats be? Cats fear dogs! Dogs fear cats! Cats hate dogs and dogs hate cats. Dogs are afraid of cats, and don’t tell me that they aren’t or I will—” Kitty started yelling at Jose Cuervo, but just then the man who was talking to the little  man in the green overalls and yellow hat ran up to them and started shouting at Kitty.
“You’re a troublemaker, Kitty Pawsky! There aren’t any cats around here! You have no proof that there are any cats in this park! Even if there were, which there aren’t, then it isn’t right to accuse the cats in this park of murder! What kind of detective are you anyway? Can’t you see that you are completely barking up the wrong tree? You don’t even belong in this park! I don’t understand why you are here! You must leave now before I have to call Animal Control!”

The man got so angry that Kitty was afraid that he might actually call Animal Control, and she began to slink away. This made the man even angrier. “You give me one good reason why you should stay here!” he yelled after her.

Kitty did not want to give the man a reason why she should stay in the park, so she meowed as loudly as she could and then ran into the tall grass. Just as she entered the tall grass, a skinny little white dog with big brown eyes who was wearing a pink collar came running up to her.

The slender little white puppy stopped right in front of Kitty and looked at her. “Somebody was yelling at you,” he said in an even voice.

“Yes they were,” replied Kitty. It turned out the little white puppy was Lulu Laverne, who had been in the park when Kitty first arrived.

Lulu Laverne’s tail wagged as he stared at Kitty. “But why were they yelling?” he asked in an innocent voice. “Are you a bad girl?”

Kitty looked confused; she had never been called a “bad girl,” but it sounded like a compliment to her. So she meowed and nodded her head.

They talked about their jobs, childhoods, and any other topic that came up. They liked the same bands and played the same video games. They traded stories about all the crazy things they had done in high school, and Shannon was surprised to find out that Luke had been part of the popular crowd. He didn’t seem like someone who would fit in there, but she wasn’t about to argue with him about it.

 
After they finished their food, Shannon suggested playing a board game. After Luke told her that he didn’t have any board games other than a Monopoly set and Scrabble, they decided on playing Scrabble even though Shannon had never actually played before. She was terrible at the game, but Luke was good enough to let her win after she lost every hand. It took them hours to finish the game, which gave Shannon plenty of time to wonder if they were ever going to do anything “normal” like have sex or sleep together. She stopped worrying about it after Luke passed out on the couch and she cuddled up next to him.

 
The next morning, Shannon woke up alone in the living room and she saw thatLuke was still on the couch sleeping in his clothes. She got dressed, called a cab, and left without waking him up.

 
She called Samantha from the cab and told her that she had spent the night at Luke’s apartment, but she hadn’t slept with him yet. Samantha laughed and told her that it was normal for couples to have sex before sleeping together. Shannon didn’t think either option was particularly appealing, but she told Samantha that she would probably call her later if anything happened between her and Luke.

 
Shannon made it back to her apartment without any major hitchhikers, but since she didn’t know where Luke lived in the city, she had no idea if he was going to show up at her apartment looking for her. The thought made her nervous so Shannon grabbed a baseball bat that had been sitting in the corner of her bedroom ever since she moved into the apartment and used it to break every mirror in the house. She didn’t believe any of those superstitions about breaking mirrors, but it made her feel better to take some sort of action, even if it was completely pointless.

 
Shannon’s friends from work were surprised to see her at work on Monday. She told them about her father’s death and the subsequent funeral, but she didn’t elaborate on the argument she had with him and all of the other reasons he could have had for leaving her mother. She didn’t want to talk about the details of her life with them because she knew that they didn’t really care all that much. They asked about Luke, and Shannon told them that he was a good guy, but not a great guy. They told her to go for it because this was their chance to finally have a real relationship with someone who wasn’t related to them. Shannon said that there was no way she was going to have sex with him right away, so they thought she should just call Samantha Shaw and ask her what she should do next.

 
Shannon didn’t call Samantha Shaw until Tuesday night, because she needed a little more time before she could muster up the courage to call. She knew that it would be an awkward conversation, but she hoped that Samantha would be able to put her in touch with an agent who could represent Shannon. She knew that she wasn’t going to be able ask Samantha for another job – not when the only reason Shannon was hired as an assistantin the first place was because of Samantha’s relationship with her. She needed Samantha’s help, and she didn’t want to ask for it.

 
Shannon called her at eight-thirty on Tuesday night and left a message with her secretary saying that she really needed to talk to her and that she would appreciate it if they could set aside some time in the next couple of days for them to meet. A few minutes later, Shannon got a call from Samantha saying that she was glad that Shannon had called her back, because she had been thinking about how they were going to get Shannon another job. She asked if this had anything to do with Shannon’s ability to write, and Shannon said yes. They set an appointment for the next afternoon at four o’clock at a coffee shop near Samantha’s office.

 
The weather was beautiful on Wednesday, and Shannon left her house early so she wouldn’t be late. She met Samantha at a coffee shop that was across the street from where Samantha worked and they sat down to talk. Shannon asked about how she could become a published writer, and Samantha said that the easiest way to do this was to start by sending her the manuscript of her firstbook. If Samantha liked it, then she would submit it to her publishing contacts and let Shannon know what happened. If the publishing houses did not like the book, then Shannon could consider writing another one. Samantha told her that she would be happy to help her with either one.

 
Samantha laughed and said that this sounded like a good plan, but that there was one thing that she should know before they started working together. She hesitated for a moment before she continued and said that Shannon may decide at some point in the future that she doesn’t want to write anymore. She might decide to leave New School or even quit writing altogether. If Shannon did this, there would be no hard feelings, but their relationship would end. Shannon knew what Samantha was talking about, and she told her that it wouldn’t be a problem. Shannon asked what Samantha meant by “relationship” and Samantha said that she didn’t want Shannon to get the wrong idea about their relationship. She explained that they were not in a sexual relationship, and then she moved on with her explanation of what she meant when she said relationship.

 
Shannon wasn’t comfortable with the way things were going, but she knew that they had to talk about the book first. Shannon told Samantha that she would send her the manuscript as soon as possible, and they said their goodbyes.",0
Anna Cooper must find a way to stop the darkness from taking over the school and protect the innocent students.,"come here expecting to be killed by a monster.

Anna Cooper and Karen Miller are still in the boiler room. The evil spirits of the school have come with them, and they are attacking Anna Cooper and Karen Miller as well. They attack Anna Cooper with punches and kicks, and they try to strangle her. They also try to choke Karen Miller to death. Anna Cooper does not have any superpowers, so she is unable to fight these evil spirits on her own. She is trapped in the boiler room, and she does not know what to do. She calls for help, but nobody comes to rescue her. The boiler room is cold and dark. There is a huge furnace that is burning with deadly fire, and there are large pipes that release steam from the furnace into the air. The temperature in this boiler room is very high, and it feels like all of the moisture has been sucked out of the air. It feels like a furnace.

The boiler room reminds Anna Cooper of certain places in which she has done her laundry. She likes to do her laundry at laundromats, because the machines in her apartment do not work very well. She has to use the laundromat machines if she wants to wash her clothes, because she does not have any hot water.

The boiler room has a strong fire smell, and there is a steamy sound coming from the pipes in the walls. There are no lights in the boiler room, which means that it is very dark. The darkness does not bother Anna Cooper much, because she can still see pretty clearly. Her pupils move back and forth to adjust to the changing levels of light. She moves her eyes back and forth as she hears the steam flowing through the pipes in the boiler room.

She moves her eyes to look at the furnace. It is very hot, and steam is coming out of it in a steamy white-colored plume. The boiler room sounds like a factory. It sounds like the sound of a factory where steel is made in a blast furnace, and big machines operate with loud banging sounds. The banging sounds are similar to the sound that metal things make when they are dropped on the floor or when a heavy metal tool is moved around.

The boiler room looks like an industrial place. It looks like a factory or an office. It is very dirty in there. There are dust and dirt all over the floor, and there are cobwebs in the corners of the room. There is also a smell of  old dust and dirt.

There are some large round pipes that seem to be made of steel, along with some thick metal tubes. There is a big steel gate near the furnace at the far end of the boiler room.

The boiler room is filled with pipes and pipes, tubes and tubes, pumps and  valves, all kinds of valves and switches, some giant round iron pipes that are connected to the furnace. The place looks like a junkyard. Everything is rusty and dirty.

She moves her eyes from here to there in the boiler room. She walks around looking at different things. Her brain is thinking about what happened to Lily Washington. She is not feeling very happy, and she wants to get out of the boiler room.

A door opens at the back of the boiler room behind her, and Karen steps through it. She closes the door behind her.

Karen does not look happy either. Her eyes are red, and her face is pale. It looks like she has been crying.

Karen Miller’s footsteps echo loudly as she walks toward her. The boiler room gets dark slowly, and there is a small glimmer of light on the floor near Karen.

“Well, well. You really did it this time, didn’t you?” she says angrily.

Karen moves her hands quickly through the air as if trying to calm herself. Anna is confused, because “do what” doesn’t make any sense.  She is looking at Karen with bewildered eyes, but she does not say anything.

Karen is still moving her hands through the air in front of her face, and she is talking too fast for Anna to understand. “It’s all your fault, Cooper! It’s all your fault that Lily Washington got hurt.”

Karen stops moving her hands in the air and turns around to look at Anna. She is looking directly into her eyes, but she is not saying anything now. Anna looks away from Karen’s eyes because it makes her nervous. Anna Cooper is getting closer to Karen, and she sees that there are tears on her cheeks now. Karen has never cried before, so this makes Anna curious.

Karen looks at Lily and then back at Anna. “I guess you know that if you rescue Lily now, we’re all going to be rescued, Cooper. Right?” she says.

Anna Cooper is shaking her head. “Yeah, I know that! But what do you want me to rescue Lily from?” she asks.

Karen shakes her head and holds out her hands as if she is trying to  grab Anna’s arms. “What are you talking about, Cooper? You know exactly what I’m talking about,” she says.

Anna takes a step backwards with her arms folded across her chest. “I don’t know what you want, Karen! You need to tell me what you want me to do!” she insists.

Karen looks down at the floor, then she looks back up at Anna. “No! I have to show you, Cooper! I have to show you everything that is going on here,” she says.

Anna Cooper looks over at the door and then down at the floor. She does not like what she is seeing, and she has a bad feeling about what Karen wants her to do. She thinks that Karen is not telling her the truth, and she does not believe her anymore. “Okay! Whatever you think you have to do! But I’m afraid I can’t wait much longer. The others will come looking for me soon, and I know that you won’t be able to keep them out of here for much longer than –” Anna is interrupted by a sudden sound – the sound of footsteps coming from outside the door.

“Cooper! Cooper, are you in there?” Karen calls out. She places her hand onto the doorknob and tries to open it.

But it is no use. The door is locked from the outside. Out of desperation, she bangs on the door with her fist, screaming: “Cooper! Cooper!”

Daniel Cooper has finally arrived. Anna hears his footsteps coming down the hallway as he approaches the boiler room .

Anna sighs in relief and picks up the mop once more, looking down at the floor and at the puddle of water that she just cleaned up. She wonders how she is ever going to get out of this mess.

"Kyle Johnson, a man Aimee met at work, comes over to visit and the two quickly become friends.","the way she wanted them. It was a little strange since she had only moved in yesterday morning, but as she started to rummage through her suitcase in search of some clothes to change into while she was here, Aimee managed to convince herself that it wasn’t that odd after all and convinced herself that her new life in the city would be much better than the one she’d left behind.

	She closed the suitcase shut and threw it on the floor before looking around for something else to occupy her time while she waited for Kyle. She went through the closet first and pulled out a few outfits before hanging them up on the hangers. She decided to go with a simple pair of jeans and a light-blue blouse for now, but when Kyle arrived she would change into something sexier so that he would know he was wanted.

	There was no doubt in Aimee’s mind that Kyle Johnson could make her love him if he wanted to, but she wasn’t sure if he did want to or not. In any case, she would need to wait until after they had spent some time together before she made any sort of move on him because that would be too forward. For now though, it looked likeshe would have to entertain herself and get ready for work all at the same time.

	She went into the bathroom and brushed her teeth with a mouthwash that she had picked up from the drugstore earlier that day, and then she washed her face with some makeup remover wipes. She put on a little lip-gloss and some deodorant after that, but her hair was still wet from her shower so she decided to forgo putting anything else in it.

	It wasn’t too strange of an idea after all; there was something very relaxing about getting all dressed up in front of a full-length mirror while waiting for someone to arrive. If Kyle hadn’t been coming over, she might even have considered going out somewhere and having a night on the town by herself, but as it was she would just settle for doing things in front of her own one-way mirror.

	She smiled as she looked at herself and wondered what Kyle would think when he saw her, but the smile faded from her face when she realized that the chances of Kyle Johnson wanting anything to do with her were slim at best. She wasn’t his type; he probably liked his women more mature than Aimee was.Even though the couple of times they had been out together, he had seemed very interested in getting to know her better, Kyle was just being nice. He probably knew that she didn’t have many friends and wanted her to have a chance to get out on the weekends, where she could also be exposed to new people. He was that kind of a guy; the kind that was always looking out for other people even if it meant sacrificing his own personal life in the process.

	She had met him about two months ago now and, as far as anyone else in their circle of friends knew, they had been dating ever since. That hadn’t been a deliberate lie on either one of their parts; it had just simply happened like that; they always seemed to be hanging around together, even though they were never alone when everyone else was there, and so the word spread just by accident. It had only been a few times that they had even gone out on their own, once to see a movie at the theatre and then once for dinner afterwards. His behaviour had been completely appropriate and there had been no cause to think that he was interested in her in any way other than professionally.

	Aimee looked at her watch again and felt a rush of excitement as the hands ticked past the point that she had told Kyle to come over; he would be there any second now. She had been waiting for this moment all day and had been in a state of nervous excitement ever since lunchtime, but she was also a little bit disappointed at the thought that it might just be a one-night-stand this time. What else could it be?

	She had asked him to come over late tonight because she knew that they would both have had quite busy days at work, so they wouldn’t be able to stay up very late and might not even have much time together at all, but she also knew that once they were alone together, no matter how short their time might be, she would get exactly what she wanted. She had been hoping for something more permanent and more loving, of course, but circumstances had never seemed quite right until now; and so she was just going to have to appreciate what little time they did have together.

	She finished brushing her teeth, put on a dark blue blouse with thin straps over her shoulders and a white mini skirt, and then straightened the collar on her short-sleeved shirt before looking in the mirror. Slipping into a pair of sensible flat pumps, she made sure that everything was perfect before picking up her handbag and heading for the door. She stepped out intothe hallway and inhaled deeply, welcoming the fresh air and trying to steady her nerves.

	As she climbed out of the elevator and walked down the hallway towards her building’s main entrance, she felt a mild nagging sensation in the pit of her stomach indicating that there was something slightly wrong with this situation, but she dismissed it as a sign that it was just nerves on her part.

	She stopped at the front desk and pressed the call button on the phone there to ask for a visitor’s parking pass, but no one seemed to hear or came to help within a reasonable amount of time – at least not enough time for her to justify waiting any longer – so she walked past the desk and out into the lobby.

	She stood just outside the main entrance for several seconds, debating whether she should go inside or not to see if someone would answer. She had never had any problems with getting help at this building before, but then again it was late and she was clearly not at her most charming or graceful tonight. At last she decided to go inside and try one more time.

	She put her bag down on the ground by the main doors and looked around to make sure no one would notice, then quickly slipped in through a",0

Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,".

Lina and Gabriel left Julio’s room with two bulging bags of clothes in each hand to make the trip over to Goodwill. Lina and Gabriel strolled down the sidewalk for a while in silence, before they walked into Goodwill and they approached the counter.

The line at the cash register was getting long as Gabriel watched Lina pay for their bags of clothes so that they could take them home and sort through them. Gabriel had never considered going to Goodwill before, but he was happy that he did now. They were able to purge some of the old unwanted items in their lives so that they could focus on everything else in their new apartment.

Gabriel left Goodwill with a smile on his face while he carried a large bag full of books back to his apartment. He did not think about the fact that if he needed more books, all he had to do was pay for them at the counter again. The only thing on his mind was his new life in his own place with someone who loved him as much as Lina did.

Once they were back in his apartment, it took Gabriel and Lina an entire afternoon to sort through Julio’s things. Gabriel discovered a few of Julio’sprized possessions hidden in the back of a closet. He found an old photo album that contained pictures from the days when Gabriel was a baby. There were also snapshots from their family vacations in Mexico, as well as photos from their move to America.

Gabriel did not want to open up the photo album in front of Lina, because there were some pictures that he knew she had yet to see. He placed the photo album on a shelf and sealed it with tape so that anyone else who might come across it would be unable to peek inside. Meanwhile, Lina found an old box of pictures that she thought Gabriel might want to see, so she took them out and placed them on the coffee table in front of him.

The first picture in the box was one that Gabriel had seen before, but he did not mind looking at it again. The photo was Gabriel’s favorite one out of all the ones featured in the photo album. The picture was taken at a beach resort in Tulum where Julio, Gabriel, and Lina stayed for a weekend getaway. The sun was shining brightly overhead and all three of them were shirtless in the photo. Julio was leaning against a palm tree while Gabriel grinned at the camera with his arms spread out to the side. Lina's hair blew in the wind. Although they werestanding about five feet away from each other, their smiles indicated that they wanted to express something for the picture.

Gabriel’s grin was wide in the picture; he looked like a completely different person from when Lina first met him. As Gabriel stared at his younger self, he couldn’t help but feel a little sad that things had not worked out between him and Lina. He could have been with her then, if only he had been more confident in himself. After all, they seemed like a cute couple: two skinny guys who were not afraid to show off their skin on the beach.

Gabriel took another look at the photo and chuckled out loud. He had a different view of things now that he knew how things turned out between them. He could say that he never liked watching himself smile, but he really did like looking at pictures of himself when he was younger. No matter how far he had fallen from his youthful state, those pictures were proof that it had once been possible for a guy like him to be happy-go-lucky and popular with almost everyone who knew him. But now he was nothing more than a guy who was constantly lonely, and an outsider among the rest of society.Gabriel took one last look at his old self before he closed the photo album and stood up. He made sure that Lina was not in the room before he opened up the photo album again, but this time he did not take any precautions. As soon as Gabriel pulled out the yellowed pages of his first childhood photos, he sat back down on his bed, got comfortable, and let Lina watch how much of a fickle human being he was.

Gabriel started right where Julio had left off; first there were more pictures from their move to America and Gabriel’s first day in school. Next came a couple of pictures before Gabriel had lost his virginity to Lina- when they were just thirteen and fourteen years old. There were also a couple of pictures where Gabriel was in his underwear while hugging one of Julio’s friends, and holding hands with another one of Julio’s friends in public.

Gabriel laughed out loud when he saw those old pictures but his laughter quickly turned to disapproval. He felt disgusted knowing that he had been so stupid back then, but it was not too late for him to do something about his current circumstances. He decided that he would be a better boyfriend this time, and Linawould not have to see any more of his past shame.

As Gabriel sat there reminiscing on how much of a jerk he had been in the past, he saw more pictures. It was a sequence of pictures depicting a young Gabriel shirtless and grinning while taking part in water sports while on vacation with his father and his family. Seeing those photos made Gabriel feel nostalgic, but also ashamed. As soon as Gabriel became aware of his reaction to the photos, he immediately started laughing at himself over his ridiculous behavior.

Gabriel grabbed the photo album from Lina’s hands and closed it again. He was not ready to revisit that part of his life just yet, but he knew that he would have to face it eventually. He was sure that if he had been able to overcome his insecurities before, there was no reason why he could not do it now.

Gabriel got up again and looked out the window at the street below. The day was getting darker as the sun started its decent, so Gabriel decided that it would be a great time to go out for some fresh air. He left Lina alone in the room with the photo album, shut off all of the lights, turned off his cell phone, and walked out into the night.",1
The world ends in a cataclysmic event.,"In a dark and grimy room, ten people huddled together on a dirty, old and worn-out mattress. The room was not much bigger than a prison cell. It was so small that it was hard to move around without bumping into the others.
	The ten people were dressed in rags and they all looked to be tired and hungry.  Their clothes were black or brown from the dirty marks that were all over them and their hair was dirt-covered and greasy.
	The people were all male, except for one woman. They were all middle-aged or older men. All of the men had tough and rugged faces that showed their years of hard work in the sun and wind. Most of their faces also showed cuts, scrapes, bruises, burns, cuts and scars from being beaten by other people.
	Two of the men had their right hands held tightly in a grip of iron from a wooden stick that was behind their backs.  These two men looked different than the others in the dirty room. They were clearly rich and important men before the apocalypse from what their clothes showed.
	Their clothes were expensive and well crafted. One of the men had on a full suit made out of black cloth with a darkbrown vest and a light gray tie. The other man had on a white coat that was torn at the shoulders, revealing his brown chest, which was covered in dirt and dirt-filled cuts.
	The ten people were huddled together in the small room to hide from the dangerous outside world. Their weapons were close by to protect them from any danger that would threaten their lives. The room was filled with several buckets that were used for collecting water leaks and one large barrel for storing water. The room also had several wooden crates that were used as beds. The group of survivors used the top of the barrels as a table where they ate and did their work from.
	The room was located deep underground in an old cave. The small door that they came in through was heavily guarded by iron bars and had a locked padlock on it to keep wild animals out.
	But worst of all, there was no sunlight in the room and it was dark and depressing.  There wasn’t even a single candle to give off some light for them to see by.
	The people didn’t know if they would ever be able to escape from the underground prison that they were trapped in.
	The world had changed but this group of survivors livedin harmony with nature. They depended on the forest to survive, and were completely oblivious to what was going on in the outside worl. They were happy and content with their lives, even though they didn’t have any idea what was happening in the outside world with all the chaos that was going on around them.
	It was a beautiful day outside and all the animals came out into the forest to enjoy it. The birds sang their merry song, bees buzzed around catching pollen from flowers, deer walked in the meadows eating flowers.  But this day of peace and joy was about to end as a man with red eyes showed up among the animals of nature. He grabbed a young fawn that was playing with its mother and ripped it open like a piece of paper. He swallowed its blood like it was a sweet delicacy to him.
	He went around looking for more food for himself, hunting every animal he could find that would get in his way. He ate their hearts, livers, kidneys and everything else that he could get his hands on. He killed young deer and ate their blood and entrails. He had no mercy for any creature that crossed his path; they were all in danger by the man with red eyes.The animals didn’t have a chance against him, they ran and squealed to their deaths; he killed them all without batting an eye. He was unstoppable. The end of the animals in the forest was near. The man with red eyes laughed as he watched each one of them die for him; he loved killing and torturing animals and this was his heaven on earth.
	However, there were some that had a chance of escaping him, but only if they acted quickly.
 	Once he was through with the forest, he marched into the woods. The leaves danced merrily as he walked across them; he didn’t disturb anything in his path because it was so perfect. Everything was exactly as it should be in this forest. He wanted to stay here forever and never have to leave it again, but he knew that wasn’t possible for him because a special day was coming soon.
 	He walked on until he reached a small cabin in the woods near a stream. It looked like a decent place to stay so he went inside and found what he needed for shelter from the elements, along with some food. He went outside and put up tarps to cover the windows of the cabin so no one couldsee him inside. Then he sat down beside the stream and ate his dinner. He noticed a deer in the distance; it was too far for him to shoot, but he didn’t need to worry about that because it was almost time.
	He looked at his watch and saw that a few minutes had passed since he had last checked; it was now time. He picked up his rifle and stood in front of the deer. It was staring at him with frightened eyes; he took aim and shot it in the head, killing it instantly. It fell onto its side as blood began to spill out. The man smiled as he watched the animal’s life leave its body; it was beautiful. Quickly, he went over and tore open the animal’s stomach with his bare hands. He scooped out its entrails and ate them before drinking its blood. The taste was fresh and sweet; he loved doing this because it gave him strength and power over other animals. He drank every drop of it until the animal was finished. Then he rested and waited for nightfall.
	The moon rose high into the sky as night approached; it was a beautiful sight to see every time he saw it, but this night was more special than In a dark and grimy room, ten people huddled together on a dirty, old and worn-out mattress. The room was not much bigger than a prison cell. It was so small that it was hard to move around without bumping into the others.
	The ten people were dressed in rags and they all looked to be tired and hungry.  Their clothes were black or brown from the dirty marks that were all over them and their hair was dirt-covered and greasy.
	The people were all male, except for one woman. They were all middle-aged or older men. All of the men had tough and rugged faces that showed their years of hard work in the sun and wind. Most of their faces also showed cuts, scrapes, bruises, burns, cuts and scars from being beaten by other people.
	Two of the men had their right hands held tightly in a grip of iron from a wooden stick that was behind their backs.  These two men looked different than the others in the dirty room. They were clearly rich and important men before the apocalypse from what their clothes showed.
	Their clothes were expensive and well crafted. One of the men had on a full suit made out of black cloth with a darkbrown vest and a light gray tie. The other man had on a white coat that was torn at the shoulders, revealing his brown chest, which was covered in dirt and dirt-filled cuts.
	The ten people were huddled together in the small room to hide from the dangerous outside world. Their weapons were close by to protect them from any danger that would threaten their lives. The room was filled with several buckets that were used for collecting water leaks and one large barrel for storing water. The room also had several wooden crates that were used as beds. The group of survivors used the top of the barrels as a table where they ate and did their work from.
	The room was located deep underground in an old cave. The small door that they came in through was heavily guarded by iron bars and had a locked padlock on it to keep wild animals out.
	But worst of all, there was no sunlight in the room and it was dark and depressing.  There wasn’t even a single candle to give off some light for them to see by.
	The people didn’t know if they would ever be able to escape from the underground prison that they were trapped in.
	The world had changed but this group of survivors livedin harmony with nature. They depended on the forest to survive, and were completely oblivious to what was going on in the outside worl. They were happy and content with their lives, even though they didn’t have any idea what was happening in the outside world with all the chaos that was going on around them.
	It was a beautiful day outside and all the animals came out into the forest to enjoy it. The birds sang their merry song, bees buzzed around catching pollen from flowers, deer walked in the meadows eating flowers.  But this day of peace and joy was about to end as a man with red eyes showed up among the animals of nature. He grabbed a young fawn that was playing with its mother and ripped it open like a piece of paper. He swallowed its blood like it was a sweet delicacy to him.
	He went around looking for more food for himself, hunting every animal he could find that would get in his way. He ate their hearts, livers, kidneys and everything else that he could get his hands on. He killed young deer and ate their blood and entrails. He had no mercy for any creature that crossed his path; they were all in danger by the man with red eyes.The animals didn’t have a chance against him, they ran and squealed to their deaths; he killed them all without batting an eye. He was unstoppable. The end of the animals in the forest was near. The man with red eyes laughed as he watched each one of them die for him; he loved killing and torturing animals and this was his heaven on earth.
	However, there were some that had a chance of escaping him, but only if they acted quickly.
 	Once he was through with the forest, he marched into the woods. The leaves danced merrily as he walked across them; he didn’t disturb anything in his path because it was so perfect. Everything was exactly as it should be in this forest. He wanted to stay here forever and never have to leave it again, but he knew that wasn’t possible for him because a special day was coming soon.
 	He walked on until he reached a small cabin in the woods near a stream. It looked like a decent place to stay so he went inside and found what he needed for shelter from the elements, along with some food. He went outside and put up tarps to cover the windows of the cabin so no one couldsee him inside. Then he sat down beside the stream and ate his dinner. He noticed a deer in the distance; it was too far for him to shoot, but he didn’t need to worry about that because it was almost time.
	He looked at his watch and saw that a few minutes had passed since he had last checked; it was now time. He picked up his rifle and stood in front of the deer. It was staring at him with frightened eyes; he took aim and shot it in the head, killing it instantly. It fell onto its side as blood began to spill out. The man smiled as he watched the animal’s life leave its body; it was beautiful. Quickly, he went over and tore open the animal’s stomach with his bare hands. He scooped out its entrails and ate them before drinking its blood. The taste was fresh and sweet; he loved doing this because it gave him strength and power over other animals. He drank every drop of it until the animal was finished. Then he rested and waited for nightfall.

"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.","and we might be able to meet up more frequently. Do you want to go to NYC?”

Jenna shook her head in response as she replied, “If I go to Italy, I’ll have to talk with Antonia and Damian at some point. Why can’t I just go there and talk with them now?”

Liam shrugged his shoulders as he said, “I don’t know. She did say that you shouldn’t come back to the US for a while. This might have something to do with it. But if we don’t go, you won’t be able to help me in any way, because I can’t tell Antonia and Damian about being bitten by Dracula. Who knows what they are capable of doing?”

Jenna understood the danger that could be in store for Liam if he told anyone about his bite. She also knew that he was right – she wouldn’t be able to help him if she didn’t go to Italy. Getting back to her attacker was her only priority at this moment, and she had to do whatever it took. “Ok, I’ll go to NYC with you, but first we will have to talk with Randolph Howe. Once we are done, I’ll head off to Italy.”

Liam nodded in agreement as he said, “Deal!” Jenna was feeling happy that they were going to see Randolph Howe again; she liked him, and she trusted his knowledge of vampires.

They found the vampire community easily. It was still quite early when they arrived, so only a handful of people were walking about. Everybody seemed to be going about their business quietly and respectfully, which made for a very peaceful first impression. As they walked towards the community, Jenna felt a bit uneasy. It seemed like everyone had heard of her – there were many people looking at them as if they were some kind of celebrities.

It also seemed like everyone knew that she was missing, and had returned; most vampires around here looked surprised to see her. Some didn ’t seem as surprised, and Jenna recognized the looks on their faces. They were the faces of people who knew that she had been hurt, because they had been there when it happened.

Randolph was already sitting at his desk when they arrived at the community building, but he did stand up and greet Jenna. “Jenna, good to see you again!” He then reached out his hand to Liam. “And you must be Liam Cross?”

“Yes, sir, I am. I think we have met before?” Jenna noticed that Gregory Maldonado was sitting in the corner of the office, listening in.

“I don’t think so. But I do recognize you from pictures and stuff. You are Gregory Maldonado’s son, right?”

Gregory nodded quietly. “That is correct.”

Liam smiled at Gregory. It was a stiff smile, but he was trying to be polite. “Nice to meet you, sir.”

Gregory nodded back to him. “Likewise, Mr. Cross. Now, let us move into a private room; we can talk there.” Gregory Maldonado then stood up and gestured for them to follow him.

They moved into the next room, which was a rather large office with a large desk.

Gregory sat down behind the desk, and then gestured for them to sit across from him. “Now, let us move on to the reason why you are here. Jenna, I have heard through channels that you are trying to track down Gregory Maldonado’s son?”

“Yes sir, I am. He is guilty of several crimes that he has committed in Seattle and now in my  town. I want to know where he is so I can bring him to justice.”

Gregory Maldonado laughed quietly at her words. “Really? Do you truly think he will be brought to justice if you do find him?”

Liam was starting to get nervous at this conversation. It sounded like something was being set up here, but he didn’t know what it was.

Jenna gave Gregory an annoyed look. “I do, actually. I just need to find him first so that I can give the evidence I have to the FBI.”

“You are working for them now, and yet you want to turn your back on them? There is no need to do that. I have people that can help you track down his son, and then they will turn their attention to Antonia Rossi. She has a few people keeping an eye on the club tonight, but I am sure we can move it somewhere else for a night or two. But if we do that, then it would be better if we did it now, as opposed to later. If we wait too long, we will have a lot more eyes on us.

Liam was starting to get really nervous at this point. He moved a little closer to Jenna just in case he needed to shield her or something.

Jenna took a couple of seconds to think about this before speaking again. “Moving the club is okay with me, but moving it tonight might be a bad idea.”

“Moving it to somewhere safe is not a problem. Moving it to somewhere that our enemies can attack without fear of getting hurt would probably be a poor decision. Moving the club now might be an even worse idea though.”

This was starting to sound like moving the club was a bad idea no matter what.

Jenna looked over at Antonia. “Moving the club tonight is completely out of the question. We have a huge event tonight at Club Red, and everyone is looking forward to it. Why not move it to another club tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow night might be a better choice, anyway. If you move the club now, no one would know what or where the change was, and that could make matters even worse for you. You would then have to deal with the people who knew you might move the  club, as well as those who guessed right and chose to follow you there.”

Jenna looked at Antonia for a little while. This made sense, so she said, “I guess I could postpone the move until tomorrow. Yes, I will be sure that everyone knows what’s happening by the end of tonight.”

Antonia Rossi nodded a few times, and then said, “I would be happy to help with whatever you need when it comes to your attacker. I do not have much experience with that sort of thing, but I know others who may be able to help  me.”

Jenna sighed and said, “Okay. I appreciate that. But I have a feeling that the person who did this is going to be killed tonight, if they aren’t already.”

Antonia Rossi looked at Jenna for a long time and said, “What makes you think that? It seems that only Damian was seen leaving your alley, and he was arrested shortly thereafter.”

“I saw him leave my alleyway, but not after he assaulted me. He had a knife in his hand. I even got a good look at it, and I know that there’s no way that he could have killed me if he was holding it. He may have moved to the alleyway after he stabbed me, but did so much later. I’m not sure of the exact time frame, but it was definitely after the attack. And if he moved to my alleyway after the attack, then maybe he ran into Damian Henchman there, which is why he was arrested.”

Damian Henchman said, “Jenna, that is a possibility. Damian has already been questioned by the police about what happened to you. It is possible that they talked about moving to your alleyway. But why would you think that only one person was responsible for your attack?”

“Because I didn’t see anyone else that night. I didn’t hear anyone else, either. And I definitely didn’t feel anyone moving around me in the dark.”

Antonia piped up, “Jenna is right. She was moving around a lot with her superhuman speed and agility, and she would have noticed if someone was anywhere near her.”

“Well, I can tell you that someone was moving around, because I did feel something,” said Jenna. “But it was only one thing moving around me. For the most part, that thing just held still and waited for the right time to pounce. So I moved around a little bit myself to figure out what was going on, but then it moved in the same minute that I did. And then it just held still while I tried to fight back, and then it jumped on me, picked me up, and carried me away from wherever I was walking. Then it carried me over to the alleyway between your club and my apartment building. And then it  stabbed me, and I don’t really remember anything after that.”

Dread filled Jenna’s heart as she thought about everything she had been through. This was certainly the worst thing that had ever happened to her in her entire life, and yet it wasn’t even close to the worst attack that had been made against her.

All around them, everyone watched and listened intently.

“This is a very serious accusation you are making, Miss Riley,” said Judge White. “There is no proof that Damian Henchman is your attacker at all. You were found covered with blood in a back alley, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he attacked you there. In fact, it doesn’t even necessarily mean that he attacked you at all. The evidence will be presented tomorrow morning. Until then, Mr. Henchman will remain in custody here at the courthouse.”

Jenna nodded, and they exited the courtroom together. They moved to a separate room in the basement of the courthouse, a holding cell where they could speak privately and still be guarded by both security personnel and police officers. Judge White ordered security to escort both Jenna and Henchman into this room. They moved to the room, accompanied by four security guards and a detective who had worked on the case.

The courtroom was large and imposing. The holding cell was small and cramped. Jasper moved to one corner of it, opposite the door, while Damian moved to another corner opposite him. Jenna took up a position in the middle of the room, facing both men.

Jenna was standing very still, staring intently at Damian Henchman. It was clear that she had moved past being just angry to being downright furious with him now. She had stopped herself from attacking him, but only barely—she could feel that she was holding herself back by a thread of willpower alone.

Damian moved to the center of the room as well, facing Jenna. His face was clean-shaven now, and he did not look like himself at all. He looked smaller, more vulnerable than before. He moved to the center of the room, moving past a metal divider that separated Jenna from him.

Jenna moved to one side of the divider, away from Damian Henchman.

Damian looked at Jasper, then to one of the security officers in the room, gesturing with his head for them to leave. The security officer nodded and moved to the door, opening it and gesturing for the other three men to leave as well.

The detective lingered for a moment, looking first at Jenna, then at Damian. He hesitated, then moved to leave as well.

Jenna watched the men leave, then turned her attention back to Damian.

""You attacked me,"" she said, her voice low and dangerous. It was not a question.

Damian swallowed, but did not say anything. He looked away from Jenna's gaze.

""Why?"" Jenna asked. ""What did I ever do to you?""

Damian shook his head. ""You didn't do anything,"" he said. ""It wasn't personal.""

""Not personal?"" Jenna repeated, her voice incredulous. ""You nearly killed me, and you say it wasn't personal?""",1
"Shannon meets Luke, a young man who helps her with her second book.","of Shannon.
Shannon thought that was sweet but wondered what he meant by it and hoped it wasn’t more pressure for them to get married. Charlie promised that even if they didn’t get married, Shannon wouldn’t be alone without him because he would always do what he could to care for her and make sure she was happy. She smiled and got out of the car to go inside.

 
When Shannon returned home, she found Luke watching one of her favorite movies. She thanked him for coming over and apologized again for not being able to meet with him. She explained that after everything that had happened with her father she needed time alone and she felt silly for getting upset about it. Luke told her not to apologize, especially since he only really wanted to watch the movie anyway. They both started watching the movie while Shannon explained that if people really knew how she struggled with writing every day, they would tell her that she was crazy to do it. He told her that he didn’t think she was crazy and everyone had struggles in life but most people didn’t talk about them because they thought it made them look weak. Shannon assured him that she wasn’t weak and told Luke how much she admired his work. He told her how he had been working on a play and was going to send it to one of the directors downtown when he was finished. She then told him about her novel and all of her hopes for it with Sam Shaw, who thought the novel was incredible, at a meeting that night. Luke thought that was cool and told her about his play again before asking her what she wanted to do after meeting with Sam Shaw in the city. Shannon responded by telling him about NYU.

 
As they talked more, Luke told her more about himself, including the fact that he wrote plays and screenplays. He explained that many of the stories he wanted to tell were too expensive for movies or TV but that didn’t stop him from trying to get a story out there because he believed in what he was doing. He said, “And I’m not going to stop fighting for it.” Shannon was inspired by his determination and asked him if he could help her with her second book. He said she could count on him and he looked forward to helping her reach her dreams.

 
Shannon felt closer to Luke as they talked and she wanted to see what he looked like when he was working, so she asked him if they coulddo it together. He said that he was working on something at his house and that he had two hours until his mom got home and asked her if she could give him a hand. Shannon said yes and told him that Abby had left a message saying she would be over in an hour. Luke said that they should get started on her book in the meantime, so Shannon got up to go to his house.

 
Shannon’s head was spinning for the rest of the day because of all she had done and now she was going to go hang out with someone who lived across town. She didn’t know how Luke found her, but she couldn’t deny that he felt familiar in a way that made her feel safe. Her mom had always told her to stay away from boys, but no one ever told her why or how it could hurt them when they were older. She was twenty-two years old, though, and she never thought that someone couldn’t be trusted. It was always up to the individual. Luke didn’t set off any alarms in Shannon because she believed that no matter what happened, it was going to be okay and everything would work out the way it should.Shannon got in a cab and tried to relax as the driver drove her to Luke’s house. She had never been to his neighborhood before and she felt a little nervous because he lived so far away. The cab pulled up outside of an apartment building where Luke said he lived, which was weird for a person in their early twenties to not own or rent a house yet.

 
He was waiting for her outside when she got out of the cab, and they walked up the stairs together. Shannon noticed that he seemed embarrassed by his living situation and he told her that his mother bought the apartment building to rent out so she could have some extra income. He didn’t live at home anymore because there wasn’t enough room, but he said that as long as he lived close by, it was fine with his mom because it would make him more responsible.

 
They walked into the apartment building and up a dark flight of stairs until Luke finally stopped in front of an apartment. He unlocked the door, and Shannon took off her shoes when they went inside. They were in a big studio apartment with one window that looked out onto a courtyard below it where there were some other apartments. Luke had one whole wall covered with bookshelves and he had a record player on his table in the corner, along with a few records.

 
Shannon thought that he was cute and she tried to imagine herself as a single woman living in the apartment above Luke. She imagined coming home every night to an apartment decorated like Luke’s except with flowers instead of books and records. She imagined cooking dinner for herself and her imaginary husband before they would go to bed and make love. Shannon wondered if it was normal for girls her age to fantasize about getting married and having kids.

 
She shook herself out of her fantasy as Luke opened his laptop and started working on Shannon’s novel for the next few hours while she did nothing but lie in bed. Shannon couldn’t help but feel a little jealous because she wanted to be the one sitting at the computer writing a bestselling novel, but instead she was just lying in bed.

 
Luke finally stopped working and they sat down at his table for dinner, which consisted of a takeout pizza and a bottle of wine that he bought from the corner store. Shannon wondered if he was trying to impress her or if he always ate pizza for dinner with his friends. She decided it was probably normal, because who wants to eat",1
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"Anna Cooper entered the office, a middle-aged black woman with a kind face. She wore a white uniform shirt and black pants that fit perfectly, even if her employer, Mrs. Miller, was not a size six. Mrs. Miller was sitting behind the principal’s desk, typing into her computer. A computer Anna Cooper had never seen before and would not have known how to use if it had been offered to her.

She stood at attention in front of the desk. She was a janitor and she wanted to show respect for her office, but mainly because there was no one else around. Her first day on job she had come early to get a feel for the place, and now she was waiting patiently.

Anna Cooper did not know if she would enjoy working for Mrs. Miller yet. But at least she had her looks going for her, and that was more than most of the other janitors at the school could say. Anna Cooper realized that she was being hard on herself. She was pretty, but she was also old. Not old in years, but certainly in looks. And she knew that Mrs. Miller thought she looked like a grandmother-type person, which wasn’t a compliment in Anna’s opinion.  But she was almost forty and did not want to look like she was twenty-five. She had been so young when her daughter died.

Anna Cooper felt that the principal did not even know her name yet, but Anna Cooper knew Mrs. Miller’s and had studied it carefully in case the principal expected to be called by her first name. It was a complicated one, Karen, but Anna was ready for it.

Finally the door opened and Karen walked into the room. Anna could tell at once that something was bothering her. “Mrs. Miller?” she said as she approached the desk, then  stopped briefly to give the principal more space. “I’m Anna Cooper.”

Mrs. Miller held out her hand and said quickly, “Please call me Karen. We need to be on first name terms, Anna. So I hear you are an excellent janitor and that you come highly recommended.”

Anna Cooper knew that the principal was trying to be friendly, but she was feeling off-put by the woman. And she didn’t like to be called Janitor instead of by her title. But she wanted it known that she didn’t take any nonsense from anyone. “I am not a janitor, Mrs. Miller. I have a title and I wish you would use it when addressing me.”

There was a brief silence after this statement, but then the principal said in an apologetic tone, “Of course you are, Anna. You are the head janitor and that’s what everyone calls you, right?”

“No! That is not correct. I am the Director of Facilities Management. Please call me by my title, Mrs. Miller. Or Ms Cooper if you prefer to be polite.”

Karen frowned at this and then said, “Well, I’ll just call you Janitor Cooper. It’s easier that way. Now, I need to know if you have any special talents in cleaning supplies? Do you use a certain kind of mop? How do you like to clean the floors?“

It was clear that Karen was trying to cover up for her earlier rudeness, but Anna Cooper wasn’t going to let her off the hook. She was offended by the term Janitor and it was also clear that Karen Miller had a problem with following orders. She was already starting to suspect that this would not be a good working relationship.

However, while this is something that she could work with, there were much more pressing issues. Anna Cooper needed to know what kind of writing was on the chalkboards and whether or not there were any more symbols that matched the one Daniel had shown her.

“I have no special talents in cleaning supplies,” Anna Cooper said directly. She figured this would get the discussion going again in the right direction.

“Well, that’s just great! We’re going to have a nice long talk about this ,” Karen Miller snapped.

“I think that is a bad idea,” Anna Cooper responded, “But it seems to me that you have an agenda and I don’t think it has anything to do with helping me out. So I suggest we end this conversation right here.”

The principal looked at the janitor for a second and then seemed to deflate. “Okay, but if that symbol shows up again, even on the back of a piece of paper in the trash can, I want to know about it first thing. Do you understand?”

One of the most obvious aspects of symbolism on the chalkboard is that it includes pictures of crucifixion.

Crucifixion is an old form of execution in which someone is nailed to a wooden cross. Crucifixion was originally meant as a form of punishment for those who were considered evil or heretics. Crucifixion was widely practiced by the Romans, but became increasingly unpopular in Western Europe.

Crucifixion was outlawed in some countries during the Middle Ages, but it was still practiced in England until 1853, and remained a legal method of execution in some of the world until very recently. Crucifixion is an extremely unusual method of execution for modern times, and it has been used mostly by people who are considered to be fringe groups or religious extremists.

Flailing crucifixions is a specific form of crucifixion where the victim is tied and whipped before being nailed to a cross. Flailing crucifixions refers to the violent whipping that usually accompanies crucifixion. Flailing is not an official part of the method of crucifixion, but it does occur often in countries that still practice it. Flailing is typically done with sharp metal rods or other implements, and often includes brutal beatings. The beating takes place while the cross is being raised off of the ground, and flailing is supposed to make the crucifixion more painful. Crucifixions are sometimes depicted in art, including famous works on the subject by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Flailing crucifixions are more common in modern times than flogging deaths, but depictions of both continue to appear in mainstream art.

Flailing crucifixions have been condemned by many religious leaders over the years. During the Middle Ages, flailing was condemned by Pope Gregory IX, who called it a sacrilegious act.

Crucifixion is an extreme form of torture,",0
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,"authors and musicians.

Aimee’s eyes lit up at being able to talk about books and movies with someone else who loved them as much as she did, but Kyle was having a hard time getting into it. He wanted to be listening and watching a movie at the same time, and he was finding it hard to do both at the same time.

Kyle Johnson took out a packet of candy from his jacket pocket and offered Aimee some. They sat in silence for a few moments while munching on their treats, each lost in their own thoughts. Aimee finally spoke. “I struggle with connecting to people,” she said. “There’s a lot of things I want to share about myself, but I don’t know who I can talk to about them. And sometimes I worry that no one will understand what I have to say.” 

Kyle was silent for a moment. “I know how that feels,” he said softly.

“It must be really difficult being in advertising,” Aimee said. “You have to deal with a lot of people all the time, and if you can’t connect with them… I just couldn’t do that. I would be terrible at it.”

“Like you said, it is a struggle,” Kyle said slowly. “And sometimes I wonder if it’s worth it. But then I feel selfish for  feeling that way because I do enjoy the job.” He paused and looked at Aimee, who was studying the TV intently. “But as you said, when it comes to life in general, I have a hard time connecting with people.”

Aimee glanced up at Kyle. She felt grateful to him for listening and not interrupting her. “I don’t mean this in a bad way, Kyle, but you seem like the kind of guy who doesn’t care about what people think of him. You never seem to  worry about what other people are thinking of you.”

Kyle nodded slowly. “I suppose that’s true, but I can sense when I’m being judged by other people, even if it’s not obvious. And it makes me feel alone in the world. It drives me nuts and sometimes I feel like I want to run away.”

Aimee felt a pang in her chest. She had never shared this feeling with anyone before, and she was startled to hear Kyle admit he felt the same way. Kyle seemed so calm and confident when he talked about his feelings. He really understood what Aimee was saying, which made her feel even more isolated from the world than before. She was still clutching her old teddy bear in her hands. “Sometimes I wish I could be like you, Kyle. Sometimes I feel like I’m stuck inside my own head and the world is a big scary place and I just want to hide under my bed or something. Sometimes I feel like when I’m alone, that no one really cares about me and it makes me sad.”",1
"Valerie Marx wakes up in a dark basement, bound and gagged.","Valerie Marx woke and found herself lying on the concrete floor of a dank basement.

The room stank of rotting things and mold. She smelled urine, feces, and other noisome bodily fluids. Valerie turned on her side to see how she was tied. Her wrists were fastened behind her back with a dirty twine and her ankles and knees were also fastened with twine, but she could not recognize the material. She tried to move, but the bindings were too tight. Valerie was in a small dark room, and there was no visible window, only a rectangular slit that appeared to be a basement door. She strained against her bindings, trying to get free.

Valerie felt a light touch on her left foot, above the ankle. The touch made her skin crawl. There was a bump on the sole of her foot and it seemed to be digging into Valerie’s flesh. She pulled back her foot quickly in revulsion and found herself in a sharp twist of darkness. She rolled over on her back, trying to reach her right foot, but the darkness was too thick. Valerie realized she was in a blindfold of some sort. She could see nothing except a dark blur at the periphery of her vision. Valerie began to feel faint and realized she was beginning to lose consciousness. She pulled herself up on all fours, determined not to fall unconscious. She found that she was beginning to run out of air; the basement stank with a particular pungency that made her throat burn. 

She felt along the wall, but hit something hard before her hand reached what she was searching for. There was a faint hum of electricity, and suddenly Valerie felt hot pain and prickling all over her body. She screamed at the top of her lungs, hoping someone would hear her. Valerie pushed herself along the ground, trying to escape the pain. She found that her hands were now free, but she still had her feet tied together.

Valerie pushed herself back along the ground as fast as she could, feeling around with her feet for anything that might be useful. She ran into something hard yet yielding. Valerie realized it was a door. She pushed the door open and stumbled out of the small room, into a larger one with cement walls. She tried to open her eyes and realized her hands were still bound.

Valerie tried to free herself frantically but found that she couldn’t break the  binds, even though her hands were numb from struggling so hard.

She heard a shuffling noise and then a quiet click upstairs. Valerie panicked and struggled harder, but all she could hear for a moment was the dull sound of her own desperate breathing. Then she heard shuffling downstairs again, and then a loud, heavy thump as something big dropped to the floor above Valerie. She could hear the footsteps of whoever it was run down stairs, and she realized that whoever it was had managed to find her and was hunting her in the basement. Valerie started to panic, trying desperately to escape from her binds. She began kicking at the basement walls, trying to find something useful.

Valerie suddenly felt a sharp pain on the back of her legs and realized she had found something useful. She had managed to find a box of tools, which included some wire cutters. She started to cut through her binds. 

As she struggled to free herself, Valerie heard a soft thud behind her and turned around. She saw two doors in the corner of the room, and as she stared at them they both snapped shut with a loud hiss. Valerie knew there was no way out of the room. She decided to smash a  window, hoping that it would allow her to escape. She reached for the closest brick and swung it with all her might at the glass, breaking a bit of it but not enough to make a hole. Valerie dropped the brick and looked around for another. She saw some cinder blocks stacked up against the wall, and she grabbed one before dropping it on the window. It shattered loudly, and Valerie could see the bright sky through it. Then she heard footsteps behind her again and knew that she needed to escape quickly before the killer caught her.

Valerie ran over to the window and took a look outside. The window was too high for her to reach, and she had no choice but to try the doors. She walked over to one of them and tried to open it, but it was locked. Valerie reached for the other door only to find it also locked tight. She opened her mouth to scream but found a long gag in her mouth. Valerie tried once again to open the door, but it would not budge. She found a small window in the upper corner and looked through it. It was too small for her to fit through.

Valerie found a small vent near the window, and she stuck her head inside of it just as someone started",1
"Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.","else where it is warm and has green fields?”

Jack shrugged his shoulders. “It’s just the first place that came to mind, Eliza. I don’t want to be here anymore. It reminds me of you too much, and I can’t stand the thought of that.”

Eliza moved closer to him again.

“It reminds you of me? You know, Jack, I may be dead, but I can still feel your touch on my skin. I can still feel our bodies pressing together and how strong you were when you made love to me.”

Jack moved closer to her again, as close as the grave would allow him, and looked into her eyes.

Jack stared at her for a long moment before saying anything to her. He could feel his heart beat faster as he looked into her beautiful blue eyes and listened to her soft voice.

“I moved to this place because of you, Eliza. I can’t be here anymore because it is where you died, and that is where I will always remember you. That is where everyone will remember you, and nothing could be more painful than that.”

Eliza moved her cheek to Jack’s hand while he was still speaking, and she moved her body so that they were pressed against each other.

“Moving to a new place won’t lessen the pain of losing me, Jack. It won’t make our memories fade away. Moving to a new place – anywhere – will only be a way for you to forget me.”

Jack moved his hand away from Eliza’s cheek and he placed it on the top of her gravestone. “Moving will be a way for me to get my life back,” he said as he moved his other hand to the gravestone on the other side of Eliza’s grave. “Moving is a way for us to be together again.”

Eliza could tell that Jack was getting upset with her and she moved her head away from his hand so that she could move to the other side of the gravestone. “It will never be like it used to be,” she said.

Jack moved closer to Eliza so that they were standing right next to each other once again. “Moving will make it better,” he said as  he reached out to hold her hand.

Eliza could feel the warmth coming from Jack’s body as his hand reached for hers and she pulled away from him before they touched. “I don’t want you to forget me, Jack,” she said. “I love you and I need you.”

Jack tried to talk to Eliza once again, but she didn’t say anything and he turned his head so that he could see her face as she looked at him coldly.

“You just need to get on with your life, Jack,” she said as she took a step away from him. “This is all I can do for you now.”

Jack tried to talk to her again but Eliza didn’t say anything and she disappeared before he could get a good look at her face. Jack tried to grasp for her hand but she was gone and he stared at the spot where she had stood, trying to understand what was going on.

Eliza’s ghost had been standing right next to Jack in the graveyard when she spoke to him, but there was no sign of her when he looked  around. He knew that she had gone somewhere because he could feel her presence, but he couldn’t see her any longer.

Jack walked around the gravestones and looked carefully amongst the grass as if Eliza would suddenly appear and tell him that none of this was real and that he had been dreaming all of it. He couldn’t find Eliza anywhere and she didn’t say anything as he searched, but she did nothing to stop him either.

It was clear to him that she couldn’t see him any more either. She looked like a ghost to everyone else, but her eyes were open and her ghostly appearance wasn’t accompanied by a translucent white glow like what he had seen in Halloween movies. She was just invisible to everyone except for Jack.

Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack walked around the graveyard, but he could tell that she was happy with how things had turned out. Eliza’s ghost had been one of the nicest ghosts that he ever knew, and it was wonderful to see her again. She deserved a happy ending and so did he. She didn’t say anything at all during their time in the graveyard. 

Jack watched her for a while longer and then he went over to his car. There was a lot that he wanted to do in the days ahead, but there was also a lot of unfinished business that had to be taken care of before that could happen. Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack got into his car, but she was looking at him again.

Jack wanted to tell her how much he appreciated what she had done for him after he had lost her. He wanted to thank her and ask her if there was any way that she could finish the job so that he wouldn’t have to let go. Jack wanted to tell her that she had done enough and that it was time for him to move on with the rest of his life. He wanted Eliza’s ghost to know that she didn’t have to be invisible any longer, and that she didn’t have to let go.

Jack said to her, “Eliza, please don’t leave me alone. Let go of me!”

Eliza said nothing at all.

Jack said to her, “Let go of me! Let me go! Let go! Please let me go!”

Jack tried to hold on to her, but she was gone.

Eliza’s ghost told him not to fight it and asked Jack to let go of what he was holding onto and then move on with his life. Jack asked her why, and Eliza told Jack that she wanted him to let go so that she could finally let go of him.

Jack’s ghost told Eliza that he didn’t want to move on. He didn’t want to let go of her. He didn’t want to live his  life without her. Eliza asked Jack what he would do if she stayed.

Jack said to her, “I want you to stay.” He wanted some sort of assurance that the ghost in front of him was really there, and so he asked her to repeat the question.  More quietly this time, she asked again if he wanted her to stay. When Eliza repeated the question a third time, Jack said that he did want her to stay, and so she told him that if he really wanted her to stay then she would.

Jack took a step toward the gravestone and then stopped. Eliza’s grave, Jack thought with the sudden realization of what he was doing. He was going to visit Eliza’s grave. He wasn’t visiting her body; he was visiting her grave. He was burying her all over again, this time without a body to bury. Jack took another step toward Eliza’s grave and started to weep. “Please don’t go,” he said choking on his words. “Please don’t leave me. Please stay with me. Don’t go away again. Please don’t go away .”

Eliza said that she wouldn’t leave him and that she would never go away again, but Jack was already moving toward the gravestone. He stopped when he got there and slowly walked around the gravestone looking for her whistle, which Eliza always wore around her neck. With each whistle he blew, Jack felt a hole opening up in his chest.

Jack found Eliza’s whistle under a rose bush that grew by the gravestone. He picked the rose petals off of it and blew the whistle several times, but when he stopped blowing, he felt empty again. 

Jack blew the whistle one last time and put it in his pocket. The whistle was cold in his hand, and it felt heavy with Eliza’s absence. Jack wiped the tears from his face, put on his coat and left the graveyard feeling as if all hope had been drained from him. He sat down on a park bench and looked up at the winter sky. Jack couldn’t stop thinking about Eliza, but he knew that she was right. It was time for him to let go of his past and move on with his life. But it didn’t mean that he had to like it.

Jack blew the whistle one more time, and then he put it in his pocket and left the park. He walked for a few blocks until he came to a small flower shop on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street and went inside. Jack bought mums, gardenias, geraniums, and roses and took them back to Eliza’s grave. He arranged the flowers around the base of the headstone and then sat down on the ground and leaned against it.

Jack stayed there until it started to get dark, and then he got up and brushed the dirt off of his hands. He looked at the headstone one last time and then turned and walked away.",1
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,".

Lina and Gabriel left Julio’s room with two bulging bags of clothes in each hand to make the trip over to Goodwill. Lina and Gabriel strolled down the sidewalk for a while in silence, before they walked into Goodwill and they approached the counter.

The line at the cash register was getting long as Gabriel watched Lina pay for their bags of clothes so that they could take them home and sort through them. Gabriel had never considered going to Goodwill before, but he was happy that he did now. They were able to purge some of the old unwanted items in their lives so that they could focus on everything else in their new apartment.

Gabriel left Goodwill with a smile on his face while he carried a large bag full of books back to his apartment. He did not think about the fact that if he needed more books, all he had to do was pay for them at the counter again. The only thing on his mind was his new life in his own place with someone who loved him as much as Lina did.

Once they were back in his apartment, it took Gabriel and Lina an entire afternoon to sort through Julio’s things. Gabriel discovered a few of Julio’sprized possessions hidden in the back of a closet. He found an old photo album that contained pictures from the days when Gabriel was a baby. There were also snapshots from their family vacations in Mexico, as well as photos from their move to America.

Gabriel did not want to open up the photo album in front of Lina, because there were some pictures that he knew she had yet to see. He placed the photo album on a shelf and sealed it with tape so that anyone else who might come across it would be unable to peek inside. Meanwhile, Lina found an old box of pictures that she thought Gabriel might want to see, so she took them out and placed them on the coffee table in front of him.

The first picture in the box was one that Gabriel had seen before, but he did not mind looking at it again. The photo was Gabriel’s favorite one out of all the ones featured in the photo album. The picture was taken at a beach resort in Tulum where Julio, Gabriel, and Lina stayed for a weekend getaway. The sun was shining brightly overhead and all three of them were shirtless in the photo. Julio was leaning against a palm tree while Gabriel grinned at the camera with his arms spread out to the side. Lina's hair blew in the wind. Although they werestanding about five feet away from each other, their smiles indicated that they wanted to express something for the picture.

Gabriel’s grin was wide in the picture; he looked like a completely different person from when Lina first met him. As Gabriel stared at his younger self, he couldn’t help but feel a little sad that things had not worked out between him and Lina. He could have been with her then, if only he had been more confident in himself. After all, they seemed like a cute couple: two skinny guys who were not afraid to show off their skin on the beach.

Gabriel took another look at the photo and chuckled out loud. He had a different view of things now that he knew how things turned out between them. He could say that he never liked watching himself smile, but he really did like looking at pictures of himself when he was younger. No matter how far he had fallen from his youthful state, those pictures were proof that it had once been possible for a guy like him to be happy-go-lucky and popular with almost everyone who knew him. But now he was nothing more than a guy who was constantly lonely, and an outsider among the rest of society.Gabriel took one last look at his old self before he closed the photo album and stood up. He made sure that Lina was not in the room before he opened up the photo album again, but this time he did not take any precautions. As soon as Gabriel pulled out the yellowed pages of his first childhood photos, he sat back down on his bed, got comfortable, and let Lina watch how much of a fickle human being he was.

Gabriel started right where Julio had left off; first there were more pictures from their move to America and Gabriel’s first day in school. Next came a couple of pictures before Gabriel had lost his virginity to Lina- when they were just thirteen and fourteen years old. There were also a couple of pictures where Gabriel was in his underwear while hugging one of Julio’s friends, and holding hands with another one of Julio’s friends in public.

Gabriel laughed out loud when he saw those old pictures but his laughter quickly turned to disapproval. He felt disgusted knowing that he had been so stupid back then, but it was not too late for him to do something about his current circumstances. He decided that he would be a better boyfriend this time, and Linawould not have to see any more of his past shame.

As Gabriel sat there reminiscing on how much of a jerk he had been in the past, he saw more pictures. It was a sequence of pictures depicting a young Gabriel shirtless and grinning while taking part in water sports while on vacation with his father and his family. Seeing those photos made Gabriel feel nostalgic, but also ashamed. As soon as Gabriel became aware of his reaction to the photos, he immediately started laughing at himself over his ridiculous behavior.

Gabriel grabbed the photo album from Lina’s hands and closed it again. He was not ready to revisit that part of his life just yet, but he knew that he would have to face it eventually. He was sure that if he had been able to overcome his insecurities before, there was no reason why he could not do it now.

Gabriel got up again and looked out the window at the street below. The day was getting darker as the sun started its decent, so Gabriel decided that it would be a great time to go out for some fresh air. He left Lina alone in the room with the photo album, shut off all of the lights, turned off his cell phone, and walked out into the night.",1
Anna Cooper must find a way to stop the darkness from taking over the school and protect the innocent students.,"come here expecting to be killed by a monster.

Anna Cooper and Karen Miller are still in the boiler room. The evil spirits of the school have come with them, and they are attacking Anna Cooper and Karen Miller as well. They attack Anna Cooper with punches and kicks, and they try to strangle her. They also try to choke Karen Miller to death. Anna Cooper does not have any superpowers, so she is unable to fight these evil spirits on her own. She is trapped in the boiler room, and she does not know what to do. She calls for help, but nobody comes to rescue her. The boiler room is cold and dark. There is a huge furnace that is burning with deadly fire, and there are large pipes that release steam from the furnace into the air. The temperature in this boiler room is very high, and it feels like all of the moisture has been sucked out of the air. It feels like a furnace.

The boiler room reminds Anna Cooper of certain places in which she has done her laundry. She likes to do her laundry at laundromats, because the machines in her apartment do not work very well. She has to use the laundromat machines if she wants to wash her clothes, because she does not have any hot water.

The boiler room has a strong fire smell, and there is a steamy sound coming from the pipes in the walls. There are no lights in the boiler room, which means that it is very dark. The darkness does not bother Anna Cooper much, because she can still see pretty clearly. Her pupils move back and forth to adjust to the changing levels of light. She moves her eyes back and forth as she hears the steam flowing through the pipes in the boiler room.

She moves her eyes to look at the furnace. It is very hot, and steam is coming out of it in a steamy white-colored plume. The boiler room sounds like a factory. It sounds like the sound of a factory where steel is made in a blast furnace, and big machines operate with loud banging sounds. The banging sounds are similar to the sound that metal things make when they are dropped on the floor or when a heavy metal tool is moved around.

The boiler room looks like an industrial place. It looks like a factory or an office. It is very dirty in there. There are dust and dirt all over the floor, and there are cobwebs in the corners of the room. There is also a smell of  old dust and dirt.

There are some large round pipes that seem to be made of steel, along with some thick metal tubes. There is a big steel gate near the furnace at the far end of the boiler room.

The boiler room is filled with pipes and pipes, tubes and tubes, pumps and  valves, all kinds of valves and switches, some giant round iron pipes that are connected to the furnace. The place looks like a junkyard. Everything is rusty and dirty.

She moves her eyes from here to there in the boiler room. She walks around looking at different things. Her brain is thinking about what happened to Lily Washington. She is not feeling very happy, and she wants to get out of the boiler room.

A door opens at the back of the boiler room behind her, and Karen steps through it. She closes the door behind her.

Karen does not look happy either. Her eyes are red, and her face is pale. It looks like she has been crying.

Karen Miller’s footsteps echo loudly as she walks toward her. The boiler room gets dark slowly, and there is a small glimmer of light on the floor near Karen.

“Well, well. You really did it this time, didn’t you?” she says angrily.

Karen moves her hands quickly through the air as if trying to calm herself. Anna is confused, because “do what” doesn’t make any sense.  She is looking at Karen with bewildered eyes, but she does not say anything.

Karen is still moving her hands through the air in front of her face, and she is talking too fast for Anna to understand. “It’s all your fault, Cooper! It’s all your fault that Lily Washington got hurt.”

Karen stops moving her hands in the air and turns around to look at Anna. She is looking directly into her eyes, but she is not saying anything now. Anna looks away from Karen’s eyes because it makes her nervous. Anna Cooper is getting closer to Karen, and she sees that there are tears on her cheeks now. Karen has never cried before, so this makes Anna curious.

Karen looks at Lily and then back at Anna. “I guess you know that if you rescue Lily now, we’re all going to be rescued, Cooper. Right?” she says.

Anna Cooper is shaking her head. “Yeah, I know that! But what do you want me to rescue Lily from?” she asks.

Karen shakes her head and holds out her hands as if she is trying to  grab Anna’s arms. “What are you talking about, Cooper? You know exactly what I’m talking about,” she says.

Anna takes a step backwards with her arms folded across her chest. “I don’t know what you want, Karen! You need to tell me what you want me to do!” she insists.

Karen looks down at the floor, then she looks back up at Anna. “No! I have to show you, Cooper! I have to show you everything that is going on here,” she says.

Anna Cooper looks over at the door and then down at the floor. She does not like what she is seeing, and she has a bad feeling about what Karen wants her to do. She thinks that Karen is not telling her the truth, and she does not believe her anymore. “Okay! Whatever you think you have to do! But I’m afraid I can’t wait much longer. The others will come looking for me soon, and I know that you won’t be able to keep them out of here for much longer than –” Anna is interrupted by a sudden sound – the sound of footsteps coming from outside the door.

“Cooper! Cooper, are you in there?” Karen calls out. She places her hand onto the doorknob and tries to open it.

But it is no use. The door is locked from the outside. Out of desperation, she bangs on the door with her fist, screaming: “Cooper! Cooper!”

Daniel Cooper has finally arrived. Anna hears his footsteps coming down the hallway as he approaches the boiler room .

Anna sighs in relief and picks up the mop once more, looking down at the floor and at the puddle of water that she just cleaned up. She wonders how she is ever going to get out of this mess.

Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"got sick several years ago and eventually died from cancer. Before she passed away, Jeff promised her that he would take care of Shannon after she was gone.

Jeff makes sure to tell Shannon that he is always there for her and that she can talk to him about anything at all. He tells her that he has talked with her mother a few times since she passed away, and they have even painted together. Shannon seems a bit skeptical at first but eventually decides to give it a try.

Shannon likes the idea of having an imaginary friend to talk with, because it makes her feel closer to her mom even though she isn’t able to see her anymore. She also enjoys being able to talk about the fun things in life with her imaginary friend too, because it helps bring back some of the memories that she had before.

Jeff explains to Shannon that things happen for a reason, and he encourages her to look at the good things instead of focusing on all of the bad ones. He tells her that there’s nothing wrong with remembering the good times, and he even suggests that they talk about them more often.

Shannon says yes because she knows this will help improve her mood. She also really likes painting with Jeff, becauseit allows her to express herself and have a sense of control over her life again. She even talks to Jeff’s imaginary friend, and he has many different stories that she can talk about with him. 

It turns out that Mrs. Jacobs has been listening to their whole conversation the whole time. She is impressed by how much Shannon has grown over the past few months, and she admires how brave she has been in dealing with her grief. Mrs. Jacobs has also been listening in on Shannon’s conversations with Jeff’s imaginary friend too, and she asks to come along the next time they have a conversation. She says that she has always wanted to meet him because he sounds so interesting. Mrs. Jacobs explains that she has been teaching art for years in different schools around town, and she has been having trouble coming up with a new topic for her painting class because painters tend to focus on sad things rather than happy ones. She tries not to think about it too much when she paints, but it’s still hard for her not to get stuck in the same subject matter all the time.

Shannon thinks this is an excellent idea, and they decide topaint a picture of what each one of them would like to see on Main Street in the future. Mrs. Jacobs says that they don’t have to do anything too fancy, just something that will inspire them to work hard and build a better future for themselves and their community. Shannon starts by making a picture of how she wants Main Street to look with her uncle Jeff one night after they eat dinner at Susan’s restaurant, and she tries to include everyone that has been helping her through her tough times. At first, everyone is really excited about the project, especially when they see that Shannon has put their ideas on paper. Then Shannon doesn’t feel as passionate about the project anymore after she sees how upset everyone gets when she adds another person to her sketch, a person who hasn’t even helped her yet. Everyone starts fighting about why she would ever include this person, and they can’t stop arguing with each other. Jeff makes it seem like there are only two possible options: either he or the other person can be in the picture, and no one else can be on Main Street. So Shannon has to start over again with a new sketch that doesn’t make everyone as mad. It takes her a long time before shefeels like she can finish the painting, but when she does, it is really pretty.

	 	Jeff says that Shannon should call it “Main Street in the Future,” and he tells her that they could probably put it on display somewhere to help raise money for something important like building a new park in town. Shannon paints another picture for Mrs. Jacobs and Missy Walters of how they want Main Street in the future to look like, this time excluding all of the people who are fighting with each other. Mrs. Jacobs says that this is exactly what she wanted to see, and they should add some buildings too because Main Street will look even better once it has places where people can buy things to wear or places where people can go to work.

	When Mrs. Jacobs leaves, Shannon hears her talking with her husband and she asks him for some help with something important to do soon. She tells him that he shouldn’t worry about it because Mr. Jacobs is really excited about what they are going to do, and he didn’t have anything else that he needed to do right away because the workmen are finished with whatever it was that they were doing at the house.

	Shannon falls asleep trying to figure out what sheis supposed to do, and when she wakes up, her daddy is sitting beside her in bed looking worried. She asks him if he is okay, and he says that he’s been thinking about the same thing that she has been thinking about, which is why they are only one week away from launching a prototype of their new satellite. He says that there has to be some way for Shannon to help him launch the satellite so that she will feel like she is helping her mother get better, but he knows that his heart just can’t let go of his project and allow Shannon to take over. Just then, her daddy starts coughing and choking on his own mucus before he falls over onto Shannon’s nightstand because his lungs just aren’t able to hold any air anymore.

	Shannon wakes up the next morning at 6 o’clock in the morning with her head inside of a glass of water and her mouth full of food, an apple this time, instead of a whole chicken. Mr. Jacobs is sitting on the other side of her bed looking very tired and worried, but he tells Shannon that she is very lucky because she is still very young and she has a lot of things left to paint. She starts working on",0
Jenna wakes up in the hospital a week later to find that she is now a vampire.,"and in order for that to happen Jenna needed to spend some time away from the house.

Gregory had already dug up a few of his wife’s dress shirts and pants that were still her size—she was always skinny and had stayed that way her whole life. He knew that he couldn’t get away with taking any of Antonia’s dresses—she would probably kill him if she ever found out about it.

Gregory watched as Jenna put on one of the shirts and then the pants. She looked like some frumpy middle-aged woman going out for the day, but Gregory didn’t think she looked bad in them at all. All he could see was the beautiful young woman underneath all those clothes.

Jenna stared at herself in the mirror with a look of disgust on her face—the shirt had been a little big on her before, but now it looked like it was going to burst at any moment. Her skinny frame looked even skinnier now that she had gained so much weight from not eating for a week. Gregory watched as she pulled the shirt over her head and cringed when she saw how loose it was now. He wanted so badly to take off the shirt and put on somethingelse, but he knew that it wasn’t his place.

Gregory watched as Jenna got up from the mirror and picked up a brush. She started brushing her hair, trying desperately to get it out of her face and straighten it out. Gregory could tell that she was fighting back tears as she did this because he could see one rolling down her cheek and hit the floor when she moved her hand out of her face.

Gregory walked over to where Jenna was standing by the mirror and took her by the elbow, turning her so that they were standing face-to-face. He gently brushed the tear away from Jenna’s face, then kissed it softly and gently before putting his arms around her waist.

Jenna could feel a lump forming in her throat as Gregory continued to hold her, not saying anything, just letting Jenna cry into his chest. She knew that she should be mad at him for bringing her here to kill her, but she couldn’t stay mad at this man who had been so kind to her after what he had done.

As if Gregory could read Jenna’s mind or sense what was going through it, he turned her around so that they were standing with their backs pressed againstthe wall. He gently ran his hands up and down her back and sides, not saying anything and giving Jenna time to calm herself down.

Jenna stopped crying after about a minute or two then took a deep breath. She looked up at the man who was still holding her and smiled softly before kissing him gently on the lips. Gregory kissed back as passionately as he could, wanting to show his love and gratitude to Jenna for the love that she had given him.

After a few minutes of kissing, Gregory pulled away from Jenna and smiled at her again before pulling her into his arms once more. He whispered something in her ear that she couldn’t understand, but she could tell from his expression that it was something loving and not about what he had done to her yet again.

Jenna smiled again as Gregory pulled her into the bedroom where he started taking off his clothes. They made love slowly and lovingly for hours, neither of them wanting it to end.

      ...

 “What is this?” Jenna asked as she looked at herself in the mirror of the small room that she was in. She could see that her hair was very short and now looked almost exactly like Gregory’s. Her skin had a pale, sickly greenish color to it and she could see that the lines of her face had changed as well.

She reached up and touched her nose with one hand and then pulled away from it to look at it. It was no longer straight and a little bumpy where she had broken it in the fall, but even more crooked than before. She touched her cheeks too only to discover that they were covered with tiny red spots of varying sizes. Her finger traced a long scar down her chest to disappear into her shorts, which she quickly pulled down to look at what was underneath them. There were two pinkish-white skinless circles where each of her nipples had been, with thin pink lines of scar tissue connecting them across her chest.

As she watched, one of the pale parts of her hand grew a tiny black nail and then changed into a fingernail. Her hand then turned into a claw as it cracked into the palm of her other hand, which also changed from pale to black.

    ...

 “A monster!” she screamed as she jumped back from the mirror revealing Gregory standing behind her with an amused expression on his face. “You’veturned me into a monster!”

He chuckled and pulled her close to him. “It’s normal to feel that way. I felt the same way when I first turned, but you’ll get used to it. And you won’t be alone for long, either. The others will awaken soon enough and then we can go back to the way things were before things went so horribly wrong.”

Jenna looked at him curiously. “Why didn’t you tell me that this was going to happen? I could have been mentally prepared for it.”

He shook his head sadly. “I couldn’t tell you, Jenna. I knew that if I did you would have fought me on it and tried to get away. You had to be turned against your will in order for your transformation to take hold of you. I know this is hard on you, but I promise that it’ll all be over soon.”

Her heart started pounding in her chest as she began shaking violently and she felt tears running down her face. “What did he do to me? How are we going to get me back? I won’t be a",0
Natalie goes to the police and helps them apprehend Trevor Lockwood before he can hurt anyone else .,"that month, Trevor Lockwood cleared his throat and changed the subject. “So, um, since we have our business out of the way…”

“You don’t have to worry about my rent anymore!” Natalie said, excited that another problem had been solved. She moved her legs around and leaned closer to Trevor Lockwood so that their shoulders were touching. She looked up at him with a coy smile.

The police station was located just a few blocks from Trevor Lockwood’s apartment building. The ride in the back of the squad car was short and when they arrived, Natalie was escorted into an interrogation room with a camera above the one-way mirror.

Natalie sat down on a small chair and looked over at the Detectives sitting across from her. Detectives Johnson and Lassiter of the Seattle Police Department. 

“So, why don’t you tell us what happened?” Detective Johnson asked.

“I went to meet Trevor Lockwood at his apartment, but it was obvious that something was off about him. He wouldn’t stop staring at my chest and it kinda creeped me out.”

“Didn’t you report this already? Why are you telling us again?” Detective Lassiter asked.

Natalie was about to reply when the room filled with a familiar scent. The smell of coffee and bacon, her favorite combination for breakfast.

Trevor Lockwood walked in and set a plate of food down on the table in front of her.

“For the love of God, Trevor Lockwood! What do you want from me?”

Trevor moved closer to her and whispered in her ear. 

“I want you, Natalie Harper.”

Natalie stood up and pushed him away. The detectives looked over at the two of them before they were startled by a loud banging on the door. They all turned around to see who was there, only to find Trevor standing outside with a knife in his hand.

“I have your money now, Natalie Harper, and I’m not afraid to use it.”

Detective Johnson took out his gun and pointed it at Trevor Lockwood. He shook his head in disbelief as he continued to point the gun at him.

“You can’t come in here with that knife, you crazy son of a bitch! Get out of here or I’ll shoot!”

Detective Lassiter moved between the two of them and tried to calm them down.

“Put the gun down, Detective Johnson! We don’t want to escalate this situation any further than it already is! If we take this any further, we could all be in danger. We need to figure out how to diffuse it first. Do you have a warrant?”

Detective Johnson shook his head.

“I don’t have a warrant but I do have probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. I’m here to arrest an individual for attempted murder.”

Detective Lassiter took them into the main police station. They sat down at a long table and Detective Johnson ordered everyone, including the secretaries and other detectives, to leave the room.

“Now, Detective Johnson, tell me what happened? Who did you come here to arrest? Did this person do something wrong?”

Detective Lassiter looked at the two policemen in front of him, waiting for one of them to speak up. One of them spoke first.

“Yes, we have a warrant out for a man named Trevor Lockwood. We think he may be responsible for the disappearance of five young women.”

Detective Lassiter did a quick internet search on his phone and then sat back in his chair.

“Wait, this is the same man that you came here to arrest? The one that just arrived here as well? The one who came here to… what exactly did you  say he was here to do? Did he come here to talk with you about something?”

Detective Johnson opened the folder with documentation for Trevor Lockwood. He handed it across the table to Detective Lassiter.

“His records indicate that he came here to speak with our witness, so we could arrest him.”

Detective Lassiter flipped through a few pages and then looked up at the two policemen.

“Wait, this says here that he is a serial killer?”

Detective Johnson nodded.

“That is correct. He has lured five young women to their deaths in the past three years. We believe he tried to lure our witness here today, but that she refused to go with him and instead came here to the police station where we were able to apprehend him.”

Detective Lassiter continued flipping through pages of paperwork before standing up.

“Where is this man now? We need to move fast to make an arrest.”

The two detectives explained that he was in a holding cell in the courthouse. Detective Lassiter left to make arrangements.

Detective Johnson looked down at the file on his lap and then back up at me.

“Are you ready to move forward with your statement?”

I nodded. “Yes, of course! I just need a few minutes though, if that’s okay with you.”

The two detectives agreed. I exited the room and moved to the side staircase and began climbing. When I reached the fourth floor, I entered an empty courtroom and sat down in front of the large window that overlooked Main Street. It was quiet and peaceful here, but it wouldn’t be for long. I moved to the front of the room and took a seat at the witness stand.

The courtroom door opened and Detective Johnson walked in. He closed the door behind him and turned to face me as he walked toward the witness stand.

“No problem, I understand that you just  went through something very traumatic. Take all the time you need to compose yourself. We can keep this quick and easy if you like, or we can take our time…whatever works for you.”

“It would be good to get this over with so I can begin putting my life back together.”

Detective Johnson nodded and then walked over to a wooden chair sitting directly in front of the witness stand. He sat down and then paused for a moment before speaking.

“I have a few questions I need to ask you that will help us move forward, but first I need you to meet someone.”

“Okay, who is it?”

Detective Johnson reached into his pocket and removed a piece of paper from inside his wallet. After unfolding the paper he handed it to me, and then moved closer to me.

“This is a picture of Trevor Lockwood,” he said as he pointed at the photograph. “This man is wanted by the police for multiple counts of kidnapping and murder. According to your statement, you are the latest in a long list of women who went missing under similar circumstances.”

He moved back to the wooden chair and placed his hands behind his head.

“The details of the crimes vary in each case, but they all follow the same pattern: The women agreed to meet a handsome man on a certain date after speaking with him online, but when they arrive at the location given by the man they were never heard from again. We have five instances where this exact scenario took place, and in all cases the women went to that location, but never came back.”

The detective moved closer to me, then continued talking.

“Lockwood would go to the location where the transactions were supposed to take place, but when a woman arrived there he would either move the location or have one of his accomplices do it. In all cases, no trace of any of these women was ever found again. We have gone to the locations Lockwood has been listed at, but all traces of him were long gone.”

He moved back to the chair and straightened his tie.

“The reason why we moved so quickly in this instance is that one of our informers said that Lockwood had been planning to lure yet another woman to her death, and that he had been bragging about it online. We were able to track him down and arrest him before he could carry out his plan.”

The detective paused for a moment, then looked at me.

“So, you see, Miss Harper, you are very lucky to be alive.”

I nodded in understanding, then asked the question that had been on my mind since I had first heard about this case.

“Detective, why do you think Trevor Lockwood did this?”

The detective leaned back in his chair and sighed.

“That, Miss Harper, is something that we may never know for sure. But I have my theories.”",1
"Jack goes through the motions of living, but he can't see any purpose in it without her.",", mother. I moved here because you needed me. I love you.”

“You don’t love me, Jack. You love Jane, and you know it! If Eliza were still alive, you wouldn’t have moved back east to live with me. If Eliza were still alive, you and I would be in California right now.”

“Jane is not Eliza. We were never going to move to California. Why did we have all those boxes out in the garage? Because we were going to move them into storage during the winter and then I was going to work on the house. We were going to do that together. That’s why we had the boxes out in the garage, mother!”

Mrs. Barlow turned around. “Oh, Jack,” she said wearily. “You moved your stuff out here because you moved to California, just like your father. You only came back east to be near Eliza while she was sick. Now that she’s gone, you’re moving back west just like your father before you. You don’t love me. You love California and the sunny beaches of Hollywood more than you love your own family!”

Jack was momentarily stunned. Moving to California was actually a thought that had occurred to him only recently – a fantasy he had entertained when he became upset about moving back east. But as quickly as this notion came to mind, he knew it wasn’t true. Moving to California would be an act of supreme cowardice.

“Move to California?” Jack said. “I can’t do that, not now. Not after you and dad worked so hard to get me the job here at the university. I love this job, mother! It’s the perfect position for me. I can move up the ranks here. This is where my work is going to be, my career is going to take off here. This is where I’ll raise my children someday. Move to California? No way, I can’t do that. Not now. There’s too much I want to accomplish here in Connecticut. Move there? That would be selfish. Besides, who cares about that anyway? You have to go on with your life eventually, why not now? You’re young and healthy. You still have energy and ambition. Why go on  clinging like a barnacle to my shipwreck of a marriage?”

Jack was suddenly furious at what he had said. He felt badly, almost guilty. But his anger got the better of him, and he continued speaking as if having rehearsed his lines. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that. But I can’t just sit around here and work at the gym all day. It doesn’t get me anywhere. It doesn’t accomplish anything. I have to keep busy, keep working on something important. Something meaningful. Otherwise I might just lose my mind. Work gives me structure. It gives me something to focus on, some purpose for being here at all. I can work on projects, and help out at the gym. And maybe, someday down the road, after a couple years or so? Maybe then I can move to California, start over, find someone new. But Jack, for now? Work is where I need to be.

Jack worked on a project about water treatment systems all afternoon, and began thinking again about his mother’s words later on in the day. He began second-guessing himself. She had probably been right, she always was.  She didn’t want him to move away, and that was why she had brought up the subject. She had been lonely lately, which is why she kept calling him and talking so much on the phone.

Jack went home around five o’clock. He took a quick shower, and put on a suit and tie. His mother had made plans to get her hair cut later that night, and she wanted Jack to come with her.

“She wants you there because she wants to pick out your clothes,” he told himself as he walked upstairs.

Jack made himself a quick dinner of roast beef and vegetables before he went to his mother’s house.

His mother had started putting on weight since moving back east, and she was not happy about it. She was convinced that the extra pounds were the result of the food at Jack’s house, which she found to be lacking.

They arrived at the beauty salon a few minutes after seven. His mother fidgeted and checked her reflection in the window beside them before moving inside. The stylist was already waiting for them when they arrived. They moved over to a hair washing station, where the stylist put on a large cape.

“I can tell you two are twins,” she said as they moved to the styling station. “How old are you now? Twenty four?”

“We just turned twenty five,” his mother said.

They moved to a styling chair, and the stylist worked with them for more than an hour. His mother kept moving her head from side to side, and she made faces as she stared into her mirror. The stylist moved on to the next client, and then to another.

Jack moved down the street to go grocery shopping. He made a quick salad at home before he returned to his parents’ house.

His mother was in the kitchen when he arrived, and she moved close to him as soon as she saw him.

“It’s so good to have you here,” she said. “Where have you been all our lives?”

“I moved out of town for a new job about four years ago, and it never occurred to me that I could  ever move back.”

She pushed him toward the couch. “Sit next to me and let’s talk.”

Jack watched the television while they ate dinner together, and then he went upstairs to change clothes. He returned with his suitcase to spend the night in their guest room.

“You don’t have to do that, you know,” she said. “You can sleep in our bed if you want to.”

“I won’t be able to sleep if I do that,” he said. “I need to sleep on the floor.”

“Why?” she asked him.

He moved his suitcase into the guest room and answered, “I always slept on the floor when we were together. Now that you’re gone, I can’t sleep any other way.”

“You moved your side of the bed into the guest room?” she asked.

“Yes, I did, because it was too empty with just one side of the bed in it.”

She moved next to him on the bed and they lay together talking for a while. Eventually they moved to the floor.

“Do you want to go to bed?” she said.

“Good night, my love,” he said. “I love you so much. I miss you so much. I’ve tried to move on with my life since you’ve been gone, but it’s so hard. Everything is just so empty without you. Nothing means anything anymore. Why did you leave me?”

She moved closer to him and said, “It wasn’t your time yet, Jack. We had to move on with our own lives.”

They moved back into the bed and were about to have sex when she said, “Wait! What are we doing? We can’t do this anymore!”

He moved back so he was lying next to her on the bed.

“I know,” he said. “But please stay with me a little longer. I need you right now.”

They moved back together on the bed and resumed having sex. But they kept stopping because it started making them both uncomfortable and sad again. They",1
The group of survivors must face the enemy and defeat him in order to survive in this new world.,"there was a small bullet hole in his pants and blood seeping out. The man tried to stand back up again, but he collapsed to his knees in agony as blood poured out of him onto the floor.

The man tried to turn himself over so he could see where the bullet had come from, but when he turned his head he saw that it was too late; there was the woman from before standing right in front of him with a gun pointed directly at him. As soon as she saw that he had seen her, she aimed the gun at him and pulled the trigger.

With a loud bang, the gun fired and the bullet hit the man in his chest. The man felt as though he had been punched in the chest by an angry giant, but this time he was able to fall over backwards onto the ground as he gasped for air. To make matters worse, it seemed that this time he wasn’t able to scream because there was a man standing over him with a large knife. He must have been hiding under one of those pieces of meat for awhile because he seemed to have just appeared out of nowhere, and now the man was standing above him with a very large knife that looked like it would be able to cut him in half atany moment.

The man tried to scream at the man with the knife, but he couldn’t get himself to move so his throat wouldn’t stop trying to scream. The blood from his chest wound kept pouring out as the knife slowly came down closer and closer to him.

As the second man stepped over his body, he could see that there were two other men standing in front of the woman; one was dressed like a priest and another was dressed in a pair of black leather pants and a white undershirt. The priest was holding something that looked like a large knife in one hand, but it was covered by some kind of thick cloth. The man could see that the other man had something in his hand too; he didn’t know what it was from this distance but he could tell that it was very dark colored.

The man had heard the stories about the priest being a saint before the end of the world, but this was not what he had pictured. He had always thought that the stories were meant to inspire hope and trust in people, but this definitely wasn’t either of those things. The man felt his heart start beating faster as he realized what was about to happen.The man with the knife slowly approached a still bleeding Johnathan and stopped right next to him. The man with the other weapon jumped over to the priest and pulled off the cloth from his weapon which turned out to be a very large machete.

The light from the fire made it easier for the man with the knife to see. The man was relieved by this because he didn’t know how much longer he could keep his eyes open; he only hoped that it wouldn’t be long before he finally died.

The woman watched as Johnathan tried to stand up and fight off the man with the machete but it was obvious that he was barely able to stand on his own two feet. She could see him putting up a good fight, but it also looked like someone had already stabbed him in the leg; there was too much blood for it to just be his chest wound.

The woman didn’t understand why this man had so much animosity towards Johnathan or why he felt that it was necessary for him to kill him. If she had learned one thing from traveling and living with different groups of people, it was that they all had their different rules and ways of doing things; she just hoped that thisman’s way of doing things wasn’t the same as those people.

For the most part, she liked being with this big group of people. It was nice knowing that there were so many people around her who were willing to protect her in case something happened to her and also be patient with her when she struggled learning a new skill or concept that was foreign to her.

There was one other thing that she liked being around so many people for, and that was because no matter what happened, someone would always be able to get her food or water when she needed it the most. All in all, as much as there were many things about them that were strange and different, she was glad that they had taken her into their group and allowed her to help protect them from other people who wanted to do them harm.

Johnathan tried harder than he ever had before, but it just wasn’t enough. The man came closer and swung his machete at Johnathan’s head. He didn’t miss and the machete went right through Johnathan’s skull killing him instantly. Johnathan slumped over onto the ground with blood pouring out of his head and onto the ground.As Johnathan fell to the ground, Jack came up behind him and pulled out his axe. There was a loud scream and then blood shot up into the air as the man stumbled backward from Jack’s axe which had gone through his chest. As soon as Jack saw what he had done, he ran to the unconscious Maria and knelt down next to her. Maria looked up at him and smiled weakly.

As Jack was tending to Maria, Jake pounced on the other man who was still standing there with his machete in his hand. This time, Jake sunk his teeth into the man’s stomach and ripped out a piece of flesh which caused him to scream in agony as he fell to the ground clutching his stomach. He then slowly got back up on his feet as he looked around frantically for help or something that might help him stop the pain.

He glanced over at Jack who was holding a bloody towel on Maria’s wound, and then looked at Jake who was growling and drooling with saliva coming out of his mouth. The man then turned around to face the priest who was still praying for forgiveness for the people that had been killed by Jack and Jake. He raised his machete up in Jack the air and then brought it down on the priest’s head, killing him instantly.

And with that, the group of survivors had finally defeated their enemy. They had fought and killed Ratzinger Kugelman and his men, and now they were the only ones left alive in this new world. They had won the battle, but the war was far from over. There would be other enemies to face and other challenges to overcome, but they would do it together. They were a team, and they would stick together no matter what happened.",1
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,"authors and musicians.

Aimee’s eyes lit up at being able to talk about books and movies with someone else who loved them as much as she did, but Kyle was having a hard time getting into it. He wanted to be listening and watching a movie at the same time, and he was finding it hard to do both at the same time.

Kyle Johnson took out a packet of candy from his jacket pocket and offered Aimee some. They sat in silence for a few moments while munching on their treats, each lost in their own thoughts. Aimee finally spoke. “I struggle with connecting to people,” she said. “There’s a lot of things I want to share about myself, but I don’t know who I can talk to about them. And sometimes I worry that no one will understand what I have to say.” 

Kyle was silent for a moment. “I know how that feels,” he said softly.

“It must be really difficult being in advertising,” Aimee said. “You have to deal with a lot of people all the time, and if you can’t connect with them… I just couldn’t do that. I would be terrible at it.”

“Like you said, it is a struggle,” Kyle said slowly. “And sometimes I wonder if it’s worth it. But then I feel selfish for  feeling that way because I do enjoy the job.” He paused and looked at Aimee, who was studying the TV intently. “But as you said, when it comes to life in general, I have a hard time connecting with people.”

Aimee glanced up at Kyle. She felt grateful to him for listening and not interrupting her. “I don’t mean this in a bad way, Kyle, but you seem like the kind of guy who doesn’t care about what people think of him. You never seem to  worry about what other people are thinking of you.”

Kyle nodded slowly. “I suppose that’s true, but I can sense when I’m being judged by other people, even if it’s not obvious. And it makes me feel alone in the world. It drives me nuts and sometimes I feel like I want to run away.”

Aimee felt a pang in her chest. She had never shared this feeling with anyone before, and she was startled to hear Kyle admit he felt the same way. Kyle seemed so calm and confident when he talked about his feelings. He really understood what Aimee was saying, which made her feel even more isolated from the world than before. She was still clutching her old teddy bear in her hands. “Sometimes I wish I could be like you, Kyle. Sometimes I feel like I’m stuck inside my own head and the world is a big scary place and I just want to hide under my bed or something. Sometimes I feel like when I’m alone, that no one really cares about me and it makes me sad.”",1
"Eliza died six months ago, and her husband Jack still can't accept it.","Jack Barlow woke up in the morning and got out of bed. He walked into the bathroom and turned on the shower. As he waited for it to heat up, he looked at his reflection in the mirror and saw a man he didn’t know anymore. He used to be a young man with clear blue eyes and dark hair. Now his eyes were red from crying, and his hair was getting whiter by the minute. When he turned off the shower, he dried off and put on some clothes. Then he walked into the kitchen to make breakfast for himself.

When he was finished, he sat down at his dining room table and looked out of his window for a few minutes while he ate. Outside, it was a cold winter day, but that didn’t bother Jack as much as it used to. Now that his wife Eliza  was gone, what did it matter what the weather was like?

He ate his breakfast while trying to remember the last time Eliza had been in the kitchen making him breakfast. It seemed like it had been years ago. He couldn’t remember if she’d taken any interest in cooking anymore before she died. Eliza was always busy with other things, like herjob and taking care of their house. The only thing she ever really did for him was make sure he had clean clothes to wear every day and food to eat. That wasn’t too much to ask, was it? How hard could it be to wash a few shirts and make some sandwiches?

He finished his breakfast and walked over to where the dishwasher sat. He opened the door and placed his dishes inside, then turned on the machine. As he closed the door, he thought about how much Eliza would have enjoyed having that machine around when she was living here. There was no way she would have washed his dishes by hand if she had been able to do that. Eliza liked life to be as easy and convenient as possible, and she wouldn’t stand for doing any work that didn’t have to be done.

When he was finished loading the dishwasher, he reached into the top drawer of his desk and pulled out an envelope that had been there for months and carried it into the living room. He sat down on his sofa and took a deep breath as he opened the envelope. When he pulled out the letter inside, he saw that it was dated more than six months ago. It was from Eliza,and it said that she had decided to leave him. She said that there was no chance of them getting back together, and she enclosed a photo of her sleeping with another man. Jack couldn’t believe what he was seeing. He threw the photo back into the envelope and stood up. He couldn’t understand why Eliza would do this to him. They had been married for eight years and had two great kids together. They never really fought or got into any serious arguments. There was no reason for her to leave him for another man, especially after promising him that she would never do something like this as long as they were married.

He walked over to his bedroom and sat down on the bed. He got out his cell phone and started looking at the name of her lover. She had taken up with some guy named Adam Wilson, and Jack couldn’t believe it. Why did she have to sleep with him? She had no good reason to do this, and he could not figure out why she would do this to him. He was going to think about what happened for a while, so he turned off his phone and put it back in his pocket.

Jack walked back into the living room and sat down on the sofa.He looked around the room and noticed that everything looked like it always did. The same old furniture was there, and all of his wife’s things were also still in place. He started reminiscing about the last time he had spent with his wife. They had been at a concert in the park, and they had both enjoyed themselves thoroughly. She had rested her head on his shoulder, and they sang along with the band as they played their favorite songs over the radio. They had talked about how much fun they’d had that night, and how nice it was to be able to do something like that together with their kids. Jack picked up the photograph of them at the concert and started thinking about all of these things again. He had no idea that everything would change so drastically in a matter of days.

He took out his cell phone again and started looking at her pictures again. He remembered how much fun they had once again, but this time he was looking at an entirely different picture. The one that he was holding in his hands showed a younger version of himself with Eliza standing next to him. She looked just like she did during their last date when they were dancing together at the concert. They were both smiling in the picture, and hehad his arm wrapped around her waist. He was also holding a drink in his hand, and Eliza was holding one, too. However, they weren’t drinking anything at the park. The couple in the photograph wasn’t wearing any wedding rings because they weren’t married. The man she was with was holding her other hand instead of Jack.  In fact, Jack wasn’t even wearing a shirt in the photo because he had only been at home for a few minutes when she came home with her new lover.

Jack stood up and went to sit on the couch, but he couldn’t sit down just yet. Instead, he held onto the photograph tightly as his mind started racing with questions about his wife’s behavior. He tried to call them all up on his memory, but he couldn’t remember if she had been acting strangely or not. He knew that as soon as he sat down to try to think about what was happening, it would all rush back to him. That is why he stood in front of the window again for a while. He didn’t even notice that it was raining outside, nor did he hear the sound of the police sirens coming towards his house. All",1
"Kitty begins her investigation by speaking to the various dogs in the park, but none of them seem to be very helpful.","the murders and offered to investigate. Captain Kiddo agreed that Kitty might be able to help him solve the case, and asked her what she had in mind.
  “Why don’t you start by interviewing the other dogs?” he asked Kitty. “They might know more about it than we do.”
  “Good idea Captain Kiddo!” said Kitty.
  Kitty knew exactly where to start as she knew some of the dogs that had been murdered, so she went to speak with them.
  The first dog she went to see was Roger Regal, the small white Poodle who was usually near the park’s entrance. Kitty found him sitting in a corner and looking very forlorn. She sat down next to him and asked, “What’s the matter Roger?”
  “It’s dark,” he replied nervously. “I’m scared of the dark. Please move over there, it’s too close. Please, move over there further away from me.”
  Kitty moved further away from Roger and asked him again what the matter was.
  “I don’t know!” he wailed. “It’s dark and I just don’t like it! Move further away from me! I need to sit somewhere where the sun is shining, not where it’s so dark. Move further away, please move further away from me. Please move further away from me. Move, I said move!”
  Kitty moved as far away from Roger as she could, which was a bit of a problem because there were very few places for her to move to in the shade of the huge trees surrounding the park. She decided that moving further away was going to be important, so moved away from the fountain and toward the field that had signs saying “No Dogs Allowed” posted all over it.
  Moving away from Roger seemed to help him calm down a little bit, and he asked, “Is the park closed? Is that why you moved here? Are you moving to a new park? Oh, wait; there aren’t any other parks around here at all. No parks! No parks! No parks! Move, I said move! I want to sit in this nice sunny spot where the sun is shining and not in this dark place with no sun in it at  all.”
  Kitty had never seen Roger act like this before, and since he seemed to be afraid of the dark she moved further away from him. She didn’t really feel like sitting in the field where there wasn’t any grass and no trees, so she sat down on a bench near the entrance to the park, looking around for someone who might be able to tell her more about what was going on. She started talking to a large black dog who claimed to be named Simon Bones, but Simon seemed to think that he was actually a Skeleton Dog. He said that he lived in the park and told her that he was afraid of something. Roger Regal was still sitting at the spot where she had been before, barking things like “There is no sun! There isn’t any sun! There is no sun at all!” over and over again. 
“Do you know what is going on?” Kitty asked the Skeleton Dog.
Simon shook his head, “No, I was very young when I moved here, and I never really got to know anyone because I was always so frightened of everyone. You see, everyone here is afraid of a thing that lives in the park, but I don’t know what it is or what it looks like. I just know that it scares everyone, even me. That’s why I keep moving around. But for some reason no one has ever asked me about the thing that is in the park whenever they ask about the dark.”
“What does it look like?” Kitty asked, then immediately regretted it when Simon’s jaw dropped open and he started to shake. “I mean, does it have fur or scales or feathers or anything? What does it look like?” Kitty asked again, but Simon did not answer.
“What about the Skeleton Dog who is your brother? Does he know what the thing is?” Kitty asked, but Simon only shook his head once more. “Does he know anything at all? Has anyone ever talked to him about  it?” Kitty asked, but still Simon did not answer. Kitty decided she would have to ask Jose Cuervo about the thing that everyone was afraid of in the park.
As she walked up to Jose Cuervo, Kitty noticed that he was holding a bottle of tequila that looked like it was filled with Jose Cuervo. “Hey, Jose Cuervo! What is the thing that keeps all the dogs in this park hiding under their owners’ legs whenever they hear something rustling through the bushes? What is it?” Kitty asked as loudly as she could manage. She then held her ears and braced herself for Jose Cuervo to start barking at her, but instead he just grinned and said, “It’s a cat.”
Kitty gasped and stared at Jose Cuervo in disbelief. “But cats are my friends! We play together all the time! Jose Cuervo, you are making a terrible mistake! You are making false accusations about a cat who is my friend! You must apologize to me right now, or I will have to tell you what a bad dog you are and how scared of dogs you should be all the time! How scared of cats should you cats be? Cats fear dogs! Dogs fear cats! Cats hate dogs and dogs hate cats. Dogs are afraid of cats, and don’t tell me that they aren’t or I will—” Kitty started yelling at Jose Cuervo, but just then the man who was talking to the little  man in the green overalls and yellow hat ran up to them and started shouting at Kitty.
“You’re a troublemaker, Kitty Pawsky! There aren’t any cats around here! You have no proof that there are any cats in this park! Even if there were, which there aren’t, then it isn’t right to accuse the cats in this park of murder! What kind of detective are you anyway? Can’t you see that you are completely barking up the wrong tree? You don’t even belong in this park! I don’t understand why you are here! You must leave now before I have to call Animal Control!”

The man got so angry that Kitty was afraid that he might actually call Animal Control, and she began to slink away. This made the man even angrier. “You give me one good reason why you should stay here!” he yelled after her.

Kitty did not want to give the man a reason why she should stay in the park, so she meowed as loudly as she could and then ran into the tall grass. Just as she entered the tall grass, a skinny little white dog with big brown eyes who was wearing a pink collar came running up to her.

The slender little white puppy stopped right in front of Kitty and looked at her. “Somebody was yelling at you,” he said in an even voice.

“Yes they were,” replied Kitty. It turned out the little white puppy was Lulu Laverne, who had been in the park when Kitty first arrived.

Lulu Laverne’s tail wagged as he stared at Kitty. “But why were they yelling?” he asked in an innocent voice. “Are you a bad girl?”

Kitty looked confused; she had never been called a “bad girl,” but it sounded like a compliment to her. So she meowed and nodded her head.

Lulu Laverne’s tail wagged even more vigorously",0
Kyle comforts Aimee and the two share a heart-to-heart conversation that leaves Aimee feeling understood for the first time.,"on the table, “I really appreciate you guys inviting me. I’m really looking forward to spending more time with you guys. I can tell you both have a lot of wisdom to offer, and I know that if I can just learn a little bit from you, it would make me a better person.”

	Patricia laughed. “You’re too kind, Aimee. And we are very happy to have you in our lives. But the truth is that we learn just as much from you as you will learn from us. It works out for the best, I think...”

	Aimee could see in Patricia’s eyes that she was trying to convince herself and not Aimee. But it worked anyway because Aimee felt reassured and at ease, as if she had always belonged there with them. She didn’t know why she had believed Patricia when she had denied it earlier, but maybe it was because of the look in her eyes or the way she spoke about Kyle...

	…Kyle. Aimee didn’t understand how she could be so close to someone and yet feel so far away from them. As friendly as they were, the three of themdidn’t become friends until Aimee met Kyle, and she felt that he was the only one who really knew her. But even though he seemed to care about her deeply, no matter how much she got to know him, she didn’t feel any closer to him than she did at the beginning.

	Aimee couldn’t help thinking about her dad’s death again. It always bothered her so much more at night, especially when everyone else was asleep. She felt like she was the only one awake in the whole world. Even though she knew it wasn’t true, it seemed like everyone else had gotten over his death and moved on with their lives but her.

	She thought about all the things she wanted to talk to Kyle about but never did for fear of burdening him with her problems. She didn’t want to burden anyone with her problems—not her therapist, not Patricia, and certainly not Kyle. She didn’t like it when others felt sorry for her, so she worked hard to keep up a happy façade. But that didn’t make the problem go away—it just made it worse.

	She felt so lonely sometimes that she thought if shedidn’t have Patricia or Kyle around all the time she might just die.

	Aimee was starting to think that maybe she would be better off without them. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to have them in her life, but maybe they were better off without her and she was better off without them. She realized it was inevitable that everyone would one day go their separate ways, and if this is what was meant to be, then so be it. It wouldn’t be the first time in her life that things had fallen apart—it wouldn’t even be the first time this year.

	Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. “Pizza delivery!” someone shouted after rattling the door knob.

	Aimee grabbed her wallet off the table by the door and opened it. The pizza delivery boy set down a large box on the floor in front of her and handed her a receipt.

	“Thank you!” she said, stepping out onto the porch to get the box.

	But instead of carrying it inside, she put it down on the ground and sat down next to it, leaning against the railing of the porch steps. Shestared out into the dark with a blank expression on her face. Her hands began to tremble, so she crossed her arms over her stomach and put her head down on them.

	Her thoughts began to return in a flood of memories that brought her to tears. She couldn’t figure out why she was crying—it was only pizza, after all—but the floodgates were open and there was no turning back.

	She cried for her father—the sense of loss welling up inside her as she thought about how he had died alone. She cried for the friends who had left her to go off to college without her and never returned, for the friends who started going out with each other and stopped hanging out with her at all. When it came right down to it, she cried for all of the loneliness that had ever been a part of her life—loneliness in school, loneliness at home—all of it came rushing back to her at once.

	Kyle, walking back outside because he forgot his keys, stopped in his tracks when he saw Aimee sitting there crying. He thought about going back inside and getting the box for her, but eventually decided against it as he watched her cry into her palms.He wouldn’t bother her—he knew how to be a good friend.

	When her tears subsided, she found herself looking at the pizza box lying on the ground beside her. She picked it up and looked at the writing on it. The name said “Kyle Johnson” and she remembered him from work; he worked over in accounting. He was tall, skinny, and had glasses that made his eyes look like two dots on his cheekbones. His hair was thin—the kind of hair that looked gray when it was wet and looked brown when it was dry. He wore a lot of black t-shirts that fit tight around his chest and jeans with large holes worn in them all over the knees.

	She turned the box over in her hands, so she could see what was on the back. It read “Aimee Kincaid likes pepperoni” and she giggled a little to herself. She felt bad for getting upset about nothing, but she wasn’t embarrassed by the fact that she had cried like a baby over nothing—it actually felt good to get everything out, even if it was just over a pizza box. She looked up and saw that Kyle was watching her intently from across thestreet. He must have seen her crying and felt bad, so he sent her a pizza. Aimee smiled and waved at him, and he smiled back before turning away and going back into his house.

Aimee realized that she had finally found someone who understand her—someone who knew how she felt, and didn’t judge her for it. She was finally able to be herself, without feeling like she had to put on a brave face all the time. Kyle had seen her at her worst and he still wanted to be friends, which meant more to Aimee than anything else in the world.",0
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"Anna Cooper entered the office, a middle-aged black woman with a kind face. She wore a white uniform shirt and black pants that fit perfectly, even if her employer, Mrs. Miller, was not a size six. Mrs. Miller was sitting behind the principal’s desk, typing into her computer. A computer Anna Cooper had never seen before and would not have known how to use if it had been offered to her.

She stood at attention in front of the desk. She was a janitor and she wanted to show respect for her office, but mainly because there was no one else around. Her first day on job she had come early to get a feel for the place, and now she was waiting patiently.

Anna Cooper did not know if she would enjoy working for Mrs. Miller yet. But at least she had her looks going for her, and that was more than most of the other janitors at the school could say. Anna Cooper realized that she was being hard on herself. She was pretty, but she was also old. Not old in years, but certainly in looks. And she knew that Mrs. Miller thought she looked like a grandmother-type person, which wasn’t a compliment in Anna’s opinion.  But she was almost forty and did not want to look like she was twenty-five. She had been so young when her daughter died.

Anna Cooper felt that the principal did not even know her name yet, but Anna Cooper knew Mrs. Miller’s and had studied it carefully in case the principal expected to be called by her first name. It was a complicated one, Karen, but Anna was ready for it.

Finally the door opened and Karen walked into the room. Anna could tell at once that something was bothering her. “Mrs. Miller?” she said as she approached the desk, then  stopped briefly to give the principal more space. “I’m Anna Cooper.”

Mrs. Miller held out her hand and said quickly, “Please call me Karen. We need to be on first name terms, Anna. So I hear you are an excellent janitor and that you come highly recommended.”

Anna Cooper knew that the principal was trying to be friendly, but she was feeling off-put by the woman. And she didn’t like to be called Janitor instead of by her title. But she wanted it known that she didn’t take any nonsense from anyone. “I am not a janitor, Mrs. Miller. I have a title and I wish you would use it when addressing me.”

There was a brief silence after this statement, but then the principal said in an apologetic tone, “Of course you are, Anna. You are the head janitor and that’s what everyone calls you, right?”

“No! That is not correct. I am the Director of Facilities Management. Please call me by my title, Mrs. Miller. Or Ms Cooper if you prefer to be polite.”

Karen frowned at this and then said, “Well, I’ll just call you Janitor Cooper. It’s easier that way. Now, I need to know if you have any special talents in cleaning supplies? Do you use a certain kind of mop? How do you like to clean the floors?“

It was clear that Karen was trying to cover up for her earlier rudeness, but Anna Cooper wasn’t going to let her off the hook. She was offended by the term Janitor and it was also clear that Karen Miller had a problem with following orders. She was already starting to suspect that this would not be a good working relationship.

However, while this is something that she could work with, there were much more pressing issues. Anna Cooper needed to know what kind of writing was on the chalkboards and whether or not there were any more symbols that matched the one Daniel had shown her.

“I have no special talents in cleaning supplies,” Anna Cooper said directly. She figured this would get the discussion going again in the right direction.

“Well, that’s just great! We’re going to have a nice long talk about this ,” Karen Miller snapped.

“I think that is a bad idea,” Anna Cooper responded, “But it seems to me that you have an agenda and I don’t think it has anything to do with helping me out. So I suggest we end this conversation right here.”

The principal looked at the janitor for a second and then seemed to deflate. “Okay, but if that symbol shows up again, even on the back of a piece of paper in the trash can, I want to know about it first thing. Do you understand?”

One of the most obvious aspects of symbolism on the chalkboard is that it includes pictures of crucifixion.

Crucifixion is an old form of execution in which someone is nailed to a wooden cross. Crucifixion was originally meant as a form of punishment for those who were considered evil or heretics. Crucifixion was widely practiced by the Romans, but became increasingly unpopular in Western Europe.

Crucifixion was outlawed in some countries during the Middle Ages, but it was still practiced in England until 1853, and remained a legal method of execution in some of the world until very recently. Crucifixion is an extremely unusual method of execution for modern times, and it has been used mostly by people who are considered to be fringe groups or religious extremists.

Flailing crucifixions is a specific form of crucifixion where the victim is tied and whipped before being nailed to a cross. Flailing crucifixions refers to the violent whipping that usually accompanies crucifixion. Flailing is not an official part of the method of crucifixion, but it does occur often in countries that still practice it. Flailing is typically done with sharp metal rods or other implements, and often includes brutal beatings. The beating takes place while the cross is being raised off of the ground, and flailing is supposed to make the crucifixion more painful. Crucifixions are sometimes depicted in art, including famous works on the subject by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Flailing crucifixions are more common in modern times than flogging deaths, but depictions of both continue to appear in mainstream art.

Flailing crucifixions have been condemned by many religious leaders over the years. During the Middle Ages, flailing was condemned by Pope Gregory IX, who called it a sacrilegious act.

Crucifixion is an extreme form of torture,",0
Shannon's paintings help her to deal with her grief and to find a new sense of purpose.,"had been ill for a long time and they didn’t have much money so Shannon never got to go do things with her friends like go out for ice cream or get a treat from the candy store. People would always ask her if she wanted to come along with them, but she was too sad because she didn’t feel like herself anymore. At first, Shannon only painted a few trees and then more buildings, but one day she went down to the creek near their house and saw how beautiful nature was. She had always thought that nature was boring compared to watching TV, but after going to the creek one day, she realized that there could be beauty in something so simple as a tiny stream of water flowing from one pool of water into another. It made her realize how much more there was to life than just being sad about how much things had changed in the last few years.

As Shannon continued painting the creek and other parts of nature, she realized that people were missing out on so much because they weren’t taking time to see all of the beauty that was around them. It is important for everyone to learn how to live in a better way, with less energy usage and more respect for nature. She painted the beautiful flowers that grew alongthe small creek she had found and was amazed by the beauty of nature. She asked Mr. Jacobs to give her permission to paint a picture of Main Street in the future, but Mr. Jacobs told her that she needed to wait until they were approved to travel back in time before she could do something like that.

As time passed, Shannon learned how to paint better and better and became an even stronger inspiration for people who loved art. She also learned that her mother’s advice about being creative about her own education was still good, since she had never learned about all of history and so many different things in school. Her paintings became quite popular as people saw how much beauty and emotion she put into each one. Mr. Jacobs allowed her to paint a portrait of Main Street after he learned her intentions were pure and not for some kind of personal gain.

Shannon’s work became so popular that the city decided to display one of her paintings prominently in front of the museum where it would be seen by anyone who entered the town from the Old Highway 18 bridge. The picture she painted was called “Future Main Street” and showed an idyllic street scene showing all of the great things yet to come. The sign above the painting read“Shannon Daniel’s Future Main Street” in large letters. When they unveiled the painting, many dignitaries came from nearby cities to see it and congratulate Shannon on her talent. It was a day that would stay with Shannon for the rest of her life, and she could not have been more proud of herself.

Now that Shannon was moving past her difficult childhood, Rosemary began focusing on ways to start building their lives together and making a home for themselves. Although Shannon sometimes felt bad about asking for so much help, she knew she could not have made it without Rosemary and her family’s love and support. She also realized that this would be her last chance to grow up with Rosemary, so they decided it was time for them to move out of their grandma’s house and get their own place. They found an affordable apartment on the edge of town and moved in together, where they could be close to work and school while having a bit more independence than they had at grandma’s house.

Shannon never forgot what her mother had told her about being creative with her education, so she decided that she wanted to learn more about art history. She asked Mr. Jacobs if he could help her bysetting up a meeting with one of his friends, who was a curator at the art museum. They made plans to meet in the morning, and Shannon read every book on the subject that she could lay her hands on.

When they met, Shannon told him about the work she was doing and he was impressed by her knowledge. He offered to send her any information or resources that she needed and showed interest in some of the work she had been doing. He also let Shannon know that someone from the museum would be coming into town in two weeks and asked if she would like to meet with them as well. Shannon felt proud of herself, that her hard work was paying off, when Mr. Jacobs introduced her to the curator. They talked for quite a while and Shannon learned a great deal from him about how he built his career and how other artists use their creativity to express their feelings.

When Rosemary got home from work, Shannon told her everything about what had happened that day and how much she had learned. Rosemary was so proud of the person that Shannon was becoming and encouraged her to keep following her passion. Shannon knew that Rosemary would always support her and help make her dreams come true.

    ‘Well done, my girl,’ said Rosemary.
    Shannon smiled at her and then went to get something to eat.

   The next few weeks went by quickly as Shannon prepared for the big opening night. Her paintings had become very popular and she was working hard at finding time to paint while still completing her homework.

Shannon knew that there would be a lot of people in attendance on opening night because this was an opportunity for people from all over to experience the art of a young artist from their home town. She painted until late into the night and went to bed feeling nervous at the prospect of all eyes being on her.

When she woke up in the morning, Shannon started feeling very sick and ended up missing school that day as she recuperated in bed. She was sure that she had caught a cold or something and didn’t think it would affect the opening night too much.

  No one noticed that Shannon was not at the opening night because they were all too busy talking about her paintings. One of her friends picked up a newspaper and read a positive review about her work which caused quite a stir among the other attendees.

Shannon’s mom, Rosemary, was sitting in the audience with tears running down her face as she watched Shannon take her bows. It was clear to everyone that Shannon had found her calling in life and Rosemary was very proud of her.",0
"When Natalie arrives at the address Trevor gave her, she quickly realizes that something isn't right and that Trevor might be a dangerous man .","head to toe.
“Hi.” Trevor said, smiling at Natalie again. “You look even more beautiful than your pictures. I really hope you like them, because I spent a lot of time choosing them.”
He walked over to the only available table and pulled out a chair for Natalie. There were three other chairs at the table, and Natalie could see that Trevor was sitting next to a young woman who was holding an infant. Natalie sat down in the other middle seat so that she could put some distance between herself and Trevor Lockwood. He didn’t seem to notice this awkward gesture, however, because his attention was fixed on her as soon as she sat down.
“Are you hungry?” he asked her. Natalie nodded and pointed at the menu above the counter. Trevor looked at it for a moment before ordering her an almond croissant with coffee, and then he thanked the cashier by name. Natalie glanced around the room again to see if anyone else was paying attention to them, because she had never been in a restaurant that served so much wine before.
When the cashier smiled at Trevor and nodded at him, Natalie thought about asking if she knew Trevor very well, but she didn’t want to look nosy. She tried to imagine the sort of relationship a person could have with someone who worked at this restaurant, but she couldn’t come up with anything.
When the food arrived, Trevor turned his attention away from Natalie again and began eating his lunch. He chatted with the woman holding the baby and occasionally turned to Natalie every few minutes to ask her how her food was. It was obvious that he had been here many times before, because he didn’t have to take more than a few bites from any of his meals before putting them down and pushing the plates towards the center of the table.
Natalie finished her meal rather quickly because she was nervous, and then she asked for dessert when Trevor was not looking. He told her that it wasn’t polite to ask for dessert until after one finishes their main meal, but Natalie insisted that she was on vacation and needed to treat herself. Trevor and the woman with the baby exchanged a brief glance before Trevor nodded in agreement.
The woman paid for her food while the two men sat at the table together. She had long brown hair tied up in a bun, and she was dressed in a tight red sweater that showed off her cleavage. When she handedTrevor the bill, he paid her with a fifty-dollar bill and then pocketed the change. The woman smiled at Trevor, and she said something that made him laugh as she walked out of the restaurant. Natalie hoped that Trevor wouldn’t offer to pay for her meal, because she wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.
Shortly after the woman left, Trevor got up and walked to the window. Natalie noticed how handsome he looked when he turned around, and she was glad that none of her friends were with her so that they wouldn’t make fun of her for being attracted to him.
Trevor turned around suddenly to ask Natalie if it was time for the check yet, but he quickly turned away again when he saw that she was still finishing her dessert. As they were leaving, Natalie tried not to look at any of the other customers in the restaurant for fear that they would recognize her from high school or college.
It took Natalie a minute to remember his address after he told her where it was. On the way there, Trevor talked about all of his favorite foods and places to eat in New York City. By the time they arrived at his building’s lobby, Natalie could tell that he had become bored withtalking about himself.
When Trevor held the door open for her, Natalie had a brief fantasy of him taking her out to dinner and paying for it with his credit card. After getting lost twice and ending up in Times Square, Natalie tried to look at everything as if she were on vacation. When they finally arrived at Trevor’s building, Natalie reached into her purse for the cash that she had brought with her so that she could give it to Trevor in exchange for phone sex.
Trevor unlocked his apartment door and they walked into a small foyer with beige carpeting, a doorman booth, and several mailboxes. Natalie started to turn around, but Trevor pushed her past the mailboxes and headed up a flight of stairs while turning on lights along the way. At the top of the stairs, Trevor showed her another flight of stairs that led to his apartment, but she said that she wanted to go back down because she wasn’t interested in going any farther. Trevor asked her if she wanted to see some pictures of his family instead.
When Natalie told him that she didn’t care about his family, he started telling her all about himself instead. When she told him that she wasn’t interested in reading what hewrote, he stood up and took her by the hand. Natalie could tell he was taller than her by at least six inches. He told Natalie that she didn’t need to be so cold toward him because he was just trying to give her $100 for talking and listening to him on the phone. Still holding her hand, Trevor led Natalie into a dark bedroom with a black leather couch and one white wall that held a large painting. When he asked her if it was good enough for him to get naked on, she shook her head no and pulled her hand out of his.
Trevor took off his jacket and shirt, and he turned around slowly while opening his belt so that Natalie could get a good look at him as he took off his jeans. As soon as Natalie saw the small tattoo on Trevor’s left butt cheek, she realized that this was not going to be an easy way to get $100. Trevor put his wallet down on the table and began taking off his underwear. Natalie stood up and went back down the stairs without saying anything.
When she arrived at the bottom of the stairs, she tried to think of an excuse for leaving so that Trevor wouldn’t be able to follow her outside and try anything. Natalie told",0
"Jack goes through the motions of living, but he can't see any purpose in it without her.",", mother. I moved here because you needed me. I love you.”

“You don’t love me, Jack. You love Jane, and you know it! If Eliza were still alive, you wouldn’t have moved back east to live with me. If Eliza were still alive, you and I would be in California right now.”

“Jane is not Eliza. We were never going to move to California. Why did we have all those boxes out in the garage? Because we were going to move them into storage during the winter and then I was going to work on the house. We were going to do that together. That’s why we had the boxes out in the garage, mother!”

Mrs. Barlow turned around. “Oh, Jack,” she said wearily. “You moved your stuff out here because you moved to California, just like your father. You only came back east to be near Eliza while she was sick. Now that she’s gone, you’re moving back west just like your father before you. You don’t love me. You love California and the sunny beaches of Hollywood more than you love your own family!”

Jack was momentarily stunned. Moving to California was actually a thought that had occurred to him only recently – a fantasy he had entertained when he became upset about moving back east. But as quickly as this notion came to mind, he knew it wasn’t true. Moving to California would be an act of supreme cowardice.

“Move to California?” Jack said. “I can’t do that, not now. Not after you and dad worked so hard to get me the job here at the university. I love this job, mother! It’s the perfect position for me. I can move up the ranks here. This is where my work is going to be, my career is going to take off here. This is where I’ll raise my children someday. Move to California? No way, I can’t do that. Not now. There’s too much I want to accomplish here in Connecticut. Move there? That would be selfish. Besides, who cares about that anyway? You have to go on with your life eventually, why not now? You’re young and healthy. You still have energy and ambition. Why go on  clinging like a barnacle to my shipwreck of a marriage?”

Jack was suddenly furious at what he had said. He felt badly, almost guilty. But his anger got the better of him, and he continued speaking as if having rehearsed his lines. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that. But I can’t just sit around here and work at the gym all day. It doesn’t get me anywhere. It doesn’t accomplish anything. I have to keep busy, keep working on something important. Something meaningful. Otherwise I might just lose my mind. Work gives me structure. It gives me something to focus on, some purpose for being here at all. I can work on projects, and help out at the gym. And maybe, someday down the road, after a couple years or so? Maybe then I can move to California, start over, find someone new. But Jack, for now? Work is where I need to be.

Jack worked on a project about water treatment systems all afternoon, and began thinking again about his mother’s words later on in the day. He began second-guessing himself. She had probably been right, she always was.  She didn’t want him to move away, and that was why she had brought up the subject. She had been lonely lately, which is why she kept calling him and talking so much on the phone.

Jack went home around five o’clock. He took a quick shower, and put on a suit and tie. His mother had made plans to get her hair cut later that night, and she wanted Jack to come with her.

“She wants you there because she wants to pick out your clothes,” he told himself as he walked upstairs.

Jack made himself a quick dinner of roast beef and vegetables before he went to his mother’s house.

His mother had started putting on weight since moving back east, and she was not happy about it. She was convinced that the extra pounds were the result of the food at Jack’s house, which she found to be lacking.

They arrived at the beauty salon a few minutes after seven. His mother fidgeted and checked her reflection in the window beside them before moving inside. The stylist was already waiting for them when they arrived. They moved over to a hair washing station, where the stylist put on a large cape.

“I can tell you two are twins,” she said as they moved to the styling station. “How old are you now? Twenty four?”

“We just turned twenty five,” his mother said.

They moved to a styling chair, and the stylist worked with them for more than an hour. His mother kept moving her head from side to side, and she made faces as she stared into her mirror. The stylist moved on to the next client, and then to another.

Jack moved down the street to go grocery shopping. He made a quick salad at home before he returned to his parents’ house.

His mother was in the kitchen when he arrived, and she moved close to him as soon as she saw him.

“It’s so good to have you here,” she said. “Where have you been all our lives?”

“I moved out of town for a new job about four years ago, and it never occurred to me that I could  ever move back.”

She pushed him toward the couch. “Sit next to me and let’s talk.”

Jack watched the television while they ate dinner together, and then he went upstairs to change clothes. He returned with his suitcase to spend the night in their guest room.

“You don’t have to do that, you know,” she said. “You can sleep in our bed if you want to.”

“I won’t be able to sleep if I do that,” he said. “I need to sleep on the floor.”

“Why?” she asked him.

He moved his suitcase into the guest room and answered, “I always slept on the floor when we were together. Now that you’re gone, I can’t sleep any other way.”

“You moved your side of the bed into the guest room?” she asked.

“Yes, I did, because it was too empty with just one side of the bed in it.”

She moved next to him on the bed and they lay together talking for a while. Eventually they moved to the floor.

“Do you want to go to bed?” she said.

“Good night, my love,” he said. “I love you so much. I miss you so much. I’ve tried to move on with my life since you’ve been gone, but it’s so hard. Everything is just so empty without you. Nothing means anything anymore. Why did you leave me?”

She moved closer to him and said, “It wasn’t your time yet, Jack. We had to move on with our own lives.”

They moved back into the bed and were about to have sex when she said, “Wait! What are we doing? We can’t do this anymore!”

He moved back so he was lying next to her on the bed.

“I know,” he said. “But please stay with me a little longer. I need you right now.”

They moved back together on the bed and resumed having sex. But they kept stopping because it started making them both uncomfortable and sad again. They",1
The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,". “Just stay in the hall!”

Tim was frozen with fear and confusion. “What are you doing?” he asked quietly.

Julia took a deep breath and turned to Thelma. “Please get me out of here,” she said with difficulty, her voice barely audible. “I think that I’m going to be sick.”

Thelma nodded and reached for the door, but a loud crashing noise made her freeze in her tracks. Julia had turned around and saw the large dark figures moving towards them. It did not quite look like they were moving, but more like they were flowing. Then the other door opened and the little girl came walking slowly into the room.

“I am here with your doctor,” she said calmly and smiled at Julia. “He says that he will be able to help you relax and get your thoughts and feelings in order.”

Thelma moved quickly to the girl’s side and forced her back out of the door. She turned around to face the doctor.

“What are you doing here? Why are you treating my daughter this way? Why can’t I come in there with her?”

The doctor looked around the room, as if searching for an answer. He found none and started to move towards the door. “I need to talk to the patient alone, Mrs. Bates. Please wait in the hallway and out of sight until I call you back in.”

The doctor moved to the door and held it open, but Thelma had moved out of his way. She stood calmly in front of him, blocking his exit.

“No sir. You will not move from this office until you explain your intentions to this young lady and me and our doctor.”

The doctor seemed to stare at her for a full minute before he spoke again. “Are you the patient’s mother?”

She nodded.

“Do you believe your daughter needs medical or psychiatric treatment?”

Thelma moved her head slowly in a nod and waited for the doctor to speak. His voice was very calm and monotone as he replied, “I believe your daughter may need medical treatment, but not psychiatric therapy at this time. I recommend that she be seen at the local hospital , where we can give her medical attention and keep her under sedation until the medication starts to take effect.”

Thelma pulled her body straighter and showed no emotion on her face. “We will provide those services here, Doctor.”

The doctor shook his head slowly. “I cannot recommend that course of action. I believe it would be in the best interest of your daughter for her to be seen by a specialist at the hospital in Raleigh.”

Thelma nodded slowly and lowered her head.  “You will cooperate with us, Doctor. If you don’t, I will have you dismissed from this hospital and never allow you to practice medicine again in this county. I am an officer of the law and know how these matters are handled.”

Timothy Jenks stood and walked swiftly to the door. He opened it and stepped out into the hall. Thelma followed quickly. “Come with me, young lady,” she said as she led Julia out the door.

Thelma walked silently down the corridor and stopped in front of a closed door. They turned to look at Julia. She was trembling on the verge of panic. “Don’t worry, honey. It will be okay,” Thelma said as she entered the room and closed the door behind her. She walked to the bed and sat on the edge beside Julia.

Julia looked up at Thelma and started to cry. “What are they going to do with me, Mama?”

Thelma’s expression changed from one of seething anger to that of a loving mother. She walked slowly to Julia, put her arms around her, and held her close. “Oh, honey. I’m sorry. They are not going to do anything except listen to you and help you get well.”

“They? What do you mean? You mean they will just listen to me talk about this stuff? That’s all? ”

As she spoke, Thelma realized that Julia was thinking of going to a psychiatrist. She was relieved that the town doctor refused to heed Thelma’s request. Now, looking into her daughter’s face, she could see the fear and uncertainty that Julia was facing. “Yes, honey. They will listen to you and—“

Suddenly there was a sound at the door. Thelma turned and saw Karen Jones standing in the doorway of the bedroom. “The doctor wants to talk to you, Dr. Martin. They moved up your appointment.”

Thelma turned back around to face Julia and continued, “They moved up your appointment because I insisted they do so.” She smiled reassuringly at her daughter and then added, “They are going to  help you get well and I am sure everything will be fine.”

Julia hesitated, then asked, “So why are you crying?” Thelma turned away as the tears streamed down her face. Julia looked at Karen for understanding, but she had already gone back into the kitchen.

In the next few minutes, it became clear to Julia that more than one person in town was disturbed by the recent events. First, Julia’s friends avoided her, and when she spoke to them on the telephone they had little to say about anything. Then, one day a group of high school girls came by Julia’s house and began screaming at her.

“You are possessed by the devil! Get out of town! Go away! We don’t want you here anymore! Get out of town or we will kill you!” Julia was taken completely by surprise her and did not know how to react. She began crying uncontrollably.

Thelma came running out of the house with a pan in her hand, screaming at the girls to leave her daughter alone. Thelma then turned her attention back to Julia and said, “Julia, I’m so sorry. Please don’t cry. Just leave when you can and never come back here again. Please stop crying Julia, for my sake if not your own.”

Julia stood outside her house, crying and listening to the screams of the girls moving up the street. Finally, Julia left her house and ran as fast as she could into town. She ran until she could no longer run. She found herself at the town square, collapsed on the grass crying and gasping for air. She was breathing so heavily that it was difficult for her to speak, but Julia managed to say, “I don’t know what’s happening to me. I don’t think I can stay here anymore. Please help me! Please do something! Please make this stop!”

Julia did not know what else to say. She was exhausted and out of breath. Julia felt alone and scared. Julia sat in the town square, surrounded by trees and empty benches, and cried. Julia cried because she was scared, because she felt alone, because she did not know how to fix what was happening to her, and because she just did not want to feel this way",1
Julia Martin starts to experience terrifying visions.,"Julia Martin lay in her bed. She was trying to calm down and slow her breathing. The images in her head were becoming clearer and clearer. She could see the townspeople as they walked about in their normal routine, going about their business. They looked pretty normal, but they were missing something that Julia couldn’t put her finger on, but she knew that she would know it when she saw.

She could see people walking by the grocery store, and suddenly a strange aura appeared around the door of the store. The aura was a very bright white light, and Julia found herself feeling afraid for no apparent reason. Julia started to feel a sense of dread, and she didn’t understand why. Her eyes started to tear up, and a lump formed in her throat. She felt scared, and she felt like she had to run away. She ran as fast as she could away from the grocery store, but  still she felt like something was coming after her.

The light from the grocery store seemed to follow Julia wherever she ran, always remaining just out of reach. The townspeople now seemed to be changing in Julia’s vision. She could see that they had begun a process of degeneration. The people around her were becoming more and more strange.

They were losing their bodies, and now they were nothing but gray masses, moving about the streets in a ghostly fashion. No longer did they have any discernible faces or bodies; all that she could see was a mass of moving gray clouds. They moved among the stores like a cloud of smoke, occasionally forming into a face or an animal and then dissipating again.

They seemed to be looking straight at Julia, but she couldn’t quite tell if they were even aware of her. They were moving in a very strange manner, with no apparent destination in mind. They glided from the streets into people’s homes and back again, making no sense whatsoever. Now the townspeople were trying to enter her own home.

As soon as they entered, they vanished, leaving behind only gray ash on the floor. She tried to close her eyes so that she might not be forced to look upon these bizarre ghosts, but she found that she was unable to.

She opened them again, and found herself staring at the entrance to her own home. In front of her was a young man with no face or body, who seemed to be holding an arm outstretched towards her. It was as if he were beckoning her to follow him, but there was nothing she could do. She had no legs with which to move, only a cloud of moving gray ash. Still, it appeared that whatever he was beckoning her to follow him into had a definite destination in mind; it wasn’t just wandering aimlessly through people’s homes.

More and more of these silhouettes started to appear before her. For some reason she did not question this occurrence; it was as if she had come to accept the fact that these ghosts would be coming into her house. They entered from every  side, and though they had no feet they were able to make their way through the floor as if it were water. They seemed to want not only to enter her house, but also to remain inside.

She could see them clearly now, because they had all taken on the gray color of her home. She saw that they were all people she knew in one form or another, and many of them had faces that had been torn apart or sliced off, a terrible sight. They didn’t seem to be aware of that, though; they simply stood there waiting for her to follow them into her home. She knew that she had to do it.

She was led into the living room, and saw that her house had been invaded by these gray silhouettes. At first she thought that they were looking at her, but then realized that they were all looking past her towards a house at the end of the street where a woman lived with her two children. The silhouettes were coming forward in a line, and they began to move towards the woman’s house.

Thelma Bates was now standing in front of Julia, and she was pointing to the house down the street. She could see the silhouette of Thelma become more distinct in the gray cloud that surrounded them both.

“That’s where it all starts to go awry. That’s where it begins, and then before you know it, the visions are everywhere. Each one more terrible than the last.” 

Thelma began to walk down the street towards the woman with her two children. Julia wanted to go and warn her, but she was unable to move from where she was standing. She tried to call out, but could not force any sounds out of her mouth. She could see Thelma walking slowly down the street with the other silhouettes in her wake. When Thelma reached the woman’s house, she gestured for Julia to follow her. This time, Julia was able to make sounds, and she began to yell at Thelma, “What are you doing?”

“We have to show them what’s going on. We can’t let them enter that house without knowing what they are getting into,” Thelma said as she turned to Julia.

Julia continued to yell, “But they will get hurt! And so will you!”

As much as Julia wanted to stop what was happening, she could not muster up the strength to move. She tried again to yell and move her body, but both were still impossible. She heard a door open and then the sound of footsteps on the floor of the house. The figure of the woman appeared at the window and began to stare at Julia and Thelma. She stared with such fright that it frightened Julia even more.

The figure of the woman slowly turned away from the window, but she did not enter the room. Instead, she raised her hand and began to hit herself in the face over and over again.

Julia tried to yell louder, but she was still entirely incapable of moving. She was glad that Tim was in the house with them, but he was too far away for her to call out loud enough for him to hear. She wanted to scream so that he would help her, but she was mute. Thelma had jumped back and was waving to get Tim’s attention, but he did not seem to notice.

Finally, Julia made the effort to step forward even though it hurt and pulled Thelma with her. She called out to Tim and finally he turned around. It looked like Thelma was holding his left arm and Julia was holding his right. He stopped and stared at them, unable to believe what they were doing.

“Don’t come in here!” Thelma yelled at him",1
"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","Three weeks ago

Jenna Riley woke up in a cold sweat, her face damp with tears. Her heart was racing and her body shaking uncontrollably. She groaned and rolled over onto her side, cradling a pillow against her chest as she tried to calm down. Jenna had been having these nightmares for weeks now. Sometimes they were about the accident, but more often than not they were about being murdered. At first she thought that it was just an overactive imagination brought on by the accident, but the dreams kept getting worse and more detailed every time she had one. She wished that she could remember what they all meant.

Her cell phone, sitting on the bedside table, began to ring. When she saw the number flash up on the screen, her heart skipped a beat. It was her mom calling to check on her progress after Jenna had called in sick again from work. She didn’t want to get out of bed and talk to her mom, but it would be too embarrassing when she found out that she hadn’t called in sick.

Jenna groaned and put the pillow over her head as she picked up the phone. “Hi Mom,” Jenna said with a groggy voice.

“Hey honey, how are you feeling today?” Her mother asked.

“I don’t know what I have, but I feel like crap. Did you call work?” Jenna asked.

Her mother sighed. “No honey, I told them that you must have caught the worst cold in history. This place will fall apart without you there to run it,” her mother said lovingly.

Jenna laughed dryly and sighed loudly into the phone. “Mom, I can’t go to work today and I probably won’t be able to go tomorrow either. I just need to rest, that’s all. You can do everything at home just as good as I can,” Jenna said quietly.

Her mother sounded disappointed but understanding when she asked, “Are you really sick or are you just hung over from last night?”

Jenna rolled her eyes. “Mom, I don’t drink anymore. Look, I have to go now okay? Love you too.” Jenna hung up the phone and threw the covers off her body. Her head throbbed loudly and she felt nauseous whenshe stood up. She decided to take a shower, hoping that maybe it would help her headache to subside a little.

Jenna stepped into the shower and turned on the water, letting it run over her body slowly as she tried not to think about anything painful. The water was nice and warm on her body; it relieved some of the pain in her head. She closed her eyes and let the warm water run over her face; she felt so frustrated that she couldn’t remember what happened last night. She knew that a lot of bad things had happened, but all she could think about was what caused them.

“Gregory!” she screamed at the top of her lungs. She couldn’t understand why he had done it again; why he had almost killed her. He looked at her with a slight amount of concern, but there was also a glint in his eye that warned Jenna to not test him. She realized that he was going to punish her one way or another for disobeying him, so silently she stepped out of the shower and dried off. She then walked into the bedroom where Gregory stood waiting for her.

When he saw her, his smile widened and he said, “I’m glad that you were able to wake up so soon.”

Jenna looked down at the floor and answered timidly, “I-it wasn’t easy. My head hurts a lot.”

Gregory nodded in approval of her response. He walked over to the nightstand and picked up a bottle of pills. He turned around and walked back toward Jenna, holding out the pills he had taken out while he said in a gentle voice, “They should make you feel better.”

Jenna stared at the pills that were being held out to her, but she didn’t want them. She knew that they would make her forget what had happened last night. Then she would have no way of protecting herself from him if he attacked her again in the future.

“No, thank you,” she said firmly as she turned away from Gregory and put on her clothes.

Gregory turned back to the nightstand as if he hadn’t heard her response and popped another pill into his mouth. He then took a drink of water before turning back to Jenna and asking politely, “Breakfast?”Gregory hoped that food might provide her with the energy she would need to deal with him. He knew that he could no longer keep her locked away in their bedroom all day. She needed to spend some time outside of the bedroom so that her memory wouldn’t be as clear of what had happened to her. Gregory could see it in her eyes—the fear and the pain were now starting to fade from them. She was starting to accept what had happened as if it were her fault for having disobeyed him in the first place.

To keep her mind off of everything that had happened, Gregory wanted to take Jenna out and buy her a new outfit. He wanted her to go out into the world like normal people so that she would be able to remember how it felt again. The problem was that he didn’t have any money to do anything like that, not without telling Antonia where he got it from.

Gregory knew that his wife wouldn’t approve of what he was doing, but he didn’t care. He was worried that Jenna would start remembering what had happened to her and would end up telling someone else about it. It was better for Gregory if Jenna forgot every detail of what had happened,",0
"John Doe, the serial killer, tells Valerie that she must escape the basement before dawn or else she will become his next trophy.","to come down the stairs. She saw a set of keys on top of one of the boxes that were all around the basement, and she started to search until she found one with a keychain that said: John Doe in bold letters. Valerie quickly grabbed the keys and darted forward, only to find another solid door in front of her.<br><br>She once again tried the key and found that it would not open this door either. Valerie slid down to the floor of the basement and started to cry. She was trapped in a basement with an insane murderer, and she had no idea what he would do to her next. She closed her eyes, and she could hear the footsteps coming toward her. She tightened up and prepared herself as the door opened.<br><br>The killer ran at Valerie, but she evaded his grasp by rolling out of the way. He kicked her in the side of the head, knocking her to the ground once again. He picked her up by the neck and slammed her down on a nearby table. Valerie’s body went limp as she struggled to breathe.<br><br>He moved to his right side of the basement, where he had placed Valerie’s lifeless body. He placed his hands on her stomach and began to press  in, feeling her ribs pop from his pressure. Valerie grabbed the table with both hands and screamed in pain.<br><br>“Who are you? I don’t know who you are, put me down!” Valerie yelled, but John Doe ignored her cries and continued to feel her up. <br><br>“You have to escape, and you have to do it before dawn. You know that, don’t you? That’s how this game works. You have to escape before dawn or else I will begin taking your life away piece by piece.” John said, his voice thick and ominous.<br><br>Valerie continued to scream as she felt her body being violated. She gritted her teeth and forced herself to stand again, using the table for support.<br><br>John Doe looked at the young woman and smiled. He was about to say something when he heard a noise come from upstairs. He  quickly stood up and grabbed Valerie by the throat, strangling her with his bare hands.<br><br>“What are you doing? Put me down!” Valerie screamed, but she could only manage weak coughs.<br><br>She tried to thrash around in an attempt to loosen his grip, but John Doe was strong. He looked at Valerie with contempt and said, “I want to make this clear to you. You have a head start, and it’s your best chance of getting out of here alive. But if you don’t get out before dawn, then I will come after you myself and give you a head start of your own – head to my chopping block.”<br><br>John Doe let go of Valerie’s throat and walked over to the steps. He turned around and gave the young woman one last cold look before he went upstairs. <br><br>Valerie looked at the basement steps for a brief moment, hoping that John Doe would come down and finish her off. She saw the cellar door start to open, but it was too late; John Doe had left her alone with the sun just beginning to rise from the horizon.<br><br>Valerie shakily reached underneath her and felt for the door handle. She turned around and ran up the steps, falling over in her haste to get away from the basement. She ran into John Doe’s living room, which was now adorned with blood-stained sheets on the walls and blackened  photographs that once showed his happy family, and she ran into the bedroom where his wife and children used to sleep until they were ripped away by his psychotic hands.<br><br>Valerie saw her chance to escape when John Doe came back into the house – he had gone upstairs to change his bloody clothes – and she took off through the front door, which slammed shut behind her.<br><br>John Doe opened the door, ready to chase after Valerie. He stopped when she ran down the steps of the front porch and disappeared around the corner. She was running straight into oncoming traffic, but John Doe did not care. He only cared about one",1
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"Anna Cooper entered the office, a middle-aged black woman with a kind face. She wore a white uniform shirt and black pants that fit perfectly, even if her employer, Mrs. Miller, was not a size six. Mrs. Miller was sitting behind the principal’s desk, typing into her computer. A computer Anna Cooper had never seen before and would not have known how to use if it had been offered to her.<br><br>She stood at attention in front of the desk. She was a janitor and she wanted to show respect for her office, but mainly because there was no one else around. Her first day on job she had come early to get a feel for the place, and now she was waiting patiently.<br><br>Anna Cooper did not know if she would enjoy working for Mrs. Miller yet. But at least she had her looks going for her, and that was more than most of the other janitors at the school could say. Anna Cooper realized that she was being hard on herself. She was pretty, but she was also old. Not old in years, but certainly in looks. And she knew that Mrs. Miller thought she looked like a grandmother-type person, which wasn’t a compliment in Anna’s opinion.  But she was almost forty and did not want to look like she was twenty-five. She had been so young when her daughter died.<br><br>Anna Cooper felt that the principal did not even know her name yet, but Anna Cooper knew Mrs. Miller’s and had studied it carefully in case the principal expected to be called by her first name. It was a complicated one, Karen, but Anna was ready for it.<br><br>Finally the door opened and Karen walked into the room. Anna could tell at once that something was bothering her. “Mrs. Miller?” she said as she approached the desk, then  stopped briefly to give the principal more space. “I’m Anna Cooper.”<br><br>Mrs. Miller held out her hand and said quickly, “Please call me Karen. We need to be on first name terms, Anna. So I hear you are an excellent janitor and that you come highly recommended.”<br><br>Anna Cooper knew that the principal was trying to be friendly, but she was feeling off-put by the woman. And she didn’t like to be called Janitor instead of by her title. But she wanted it known that she didn’t take any nonsense from anyone. “I am not a janitor, Mrs. Miller. I have a title and I wish you would use it when addressing me.”<br><br>There was a brief silence after this statement, but then the principal said in an apologetic tone, “Of course you are, Anna. You are the head janitor and that’s what everyone calls you, right?”<br><br>“No! That is not correct. I am the Director of Facilities Management. Please call me by my title, Mrs. Miller. Or Ms Cooper if you prefer to be polite.”<br><br>Karen frowned at this and then said, “Well, I’ll just call you Janitor Cooper. It’s easier that way. Now, I need to know if you have any special talents in cleaning supplies? Do you use a certain kind of mop? How do you like to clean the floors?“<br><br>It was clear that Karen was trying to cover up for her earlier rudeness, but Anna Cooper wasn’t going to let her off the hook. She was offended by the term Janitor and it was also clear that Karen Miller had a problem with following orders. She was already starting to suspect that this would not be a good working relationship.<br><br>However, while this is something that she could work with, there were much more pressing issues. Anna Cooper needed to know what kind of writing was on the chalkboards and whether or not there were any more symbols that matched the one Daniel had shown her.<br><br>“I have no special talents in cleaning supplies,” Anna Cooper said directly. She figured this would get the discussion going again in the right direction.<br><br>“Well, that’s just great! We’re going to have a nice long talk about this ,” Karen Miller snapped.<br><br>“I think that is a bad idea,” Anna Cooper responded, “But it seems to me that you have an agenda and I don’t think it has anything to do with helping me out. So I suggest we end this conversation right here.”<br><br>The principal looked at the janitor for a second and then seemed to deflate. “Okay, but if that symbol shows up again, even on the back of a piece of paper in the trash can, I want to know about it first thing. Do you understand?”<br><br>One of the most obvious aspects of symbolism on the chalkboard is that it includes pictures of crucifixion.<br><br>Crucifixion is an old form of execution in which someone is nailed to a wooden cross. Crucifixion was originally meant as a form of punishment for those who were considered evil or heretics. Crucifixion was widely practiced by the Romans, but became increasingly unpopular in Western Europe.<br><br>Crucifixion was outlawed in some countries during the Middle Ages, but it was still practiced in England until 1853, and remained a legal method of execution in some of the world until very recently. Crucifixion is an extremely unusual method of execution for modern times, and it has been used mostly by people who are considered to be fringe groups or religious extremists.<br><br>Flailing crucifixions is a specific form of crucifixion where the victim is tied and whipped before being nailed to a cross. Flailing crucifixions refers to the violent whipping that usually accompanies crucifixion. Flailing is not an official part of the method of crucifixion, but it does occur often in countries that still practice it. Flailing is typically done with sharp metal rods or other implements, and often includes brutal beatings. The beating takes place while the cross is being raised off of the ground, and flailing is supposed to make the crucifixion more painful. Crucifixions are sometimes depicted in art, including famous works on the subject by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Flailing crucifixions are more common in modern times than flogging deaths, but depictions of both continue to appear in mainstream art.<br><br>Flailing crucifixions have been condemned by many religious leaders over the years. During the Middle Ages, flailing was condemned by Pope Gregory IX, who called it a sacrilegious act.<br><br>Crucifixion is an extreme form of torture,",0
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"to show it to.<br><br>""Oh goodness no,"" Joshua laughed as he waved his hands in the air dismissively as if to brush off what Gabriel had said. ""Of course I knew you were going to move here eventually, but I didn't know when you were going to.""<br><br>""Well, you must be psychic then,"" Gabriel said as he looked around at all of the people who lived inside of this house. It was clear that there were at least five or six vampires living here with him, but it was also clear from how much they seemed like a family of sorts that they hadn't been in this neighborhood for very long. There were small traces of blood everywhere in their house, giving off a powerful smell that made it clear that they hadn't been living here for very long at all. Was this place really just an old abandoned house that these people decided to fix up themselves? It seemed hard to believe that there could actually be such an old and run down looking house on such a nice street like this one so it didn't make sense that they had actually been living here before Gabriel moved in next door.<br><br>""Well yes of course,"" Joshua said as he led Gabriel over to the couch where he sat down on the end of it and motioned for Gabriel to join him. ""I know how you think, I knew you were going to move here eventually.""<br><br>""I bet you didn't,"" Gabriel said as he shook his head, still trying to convince himself that this guy was just a little odd and wasn't actually psychic. ""You didn't know that I was going to move into this house at all or when I was going to move in or anything.""<br><br>""No, not exactly,"" Joshua admitted as he laughed nervously to himself. He seemed like a nice enough guy when Gabriel had first met him so knew that he would be willing to help him out with no promise of payoff, it even seemed like maybe this guy wanted nothing from Gabriel and would be willing to do everything he could for him which only made sense given how much time Joshua had clearly spent waiting for someone like him to move in next door. ""Of course I knew that someone just like me was going to be moving in here but I can't really see the future nearly as well as my mother can.""<br><br>""Wait… Your mother?"" Gabriel asked before it hit him who Joshua must have meant by 'your mother.' ""She's not your actual mom is she? She's a vampire too, right? Am I about to tell you that your real mom is a vampire?""<br><br>""Yes, yes she is,"" Joshua smiled. ""She was the same as me at one point in time and then when I was born she changed me as well. She's been taking care of me ever since.""<br><br>When Gabriel left Chris's house he felt depressed, but now he was much more upbeat than he had been before which was clear to him by the smile that stretched across his face. So it wasn't just a coincidence that he had moved directly next door to a bunch of vampires; they were actually this guy's family? It didn't even seem possible for someone to be this lucky, here he was on the way out of his parent's house for good and now he had a whole family waiting for him. Someone who could keep him satisfied without wanting anything back from him except for his company.<br><br>""Are you happy now?"" Joshua asked as he waited for Gabriel to speak. He sat there patiently waiting for an answer from the young mortal who smiled back up at him from where he sat on the couch next to him. He seemed like a pretty bright kid despite being stuck living with his parent's until the age of twenty-five when he would be able to move out on his own.<br><br>""I am,"" Gabriel said as he leaned back into the couch. ""I'm not sure if I've ever been so happy to have found what I was looking for.""<br><br>""And what was it you were looking for?"" Joshua asked casually.<br><br>""This,"" Gabriel said as he reached forward and hugged Joshua's neck with both arms, pulling him close to him as he nuzzled his nose against his cheek, breathing in his scent that smelled like fresh flowers rather than the blood that they must have been drinking before they had come home. The last thing that he wanted to do now, even though it had only been a few hours since he'd met this man, was to go back home and tell his father the truth about how desperate he really was for someone like this. This man seemed like everything that Gabriel could ever want in a partner who was willing and obviously able to take care of all of his needs without asking for anything in return other than a little bit of company now and then.<br><br>It almost seemed too good to be true but there were far worse things in life than throwing away your happiness and being with someone who could easily provide you with everything that you wanted. If Chris could give him those kinds of feelings, he was surely worth losing for the guy who actually wanted him more than anything else in the world.<br><br>""I'm so happy that we're neighbors,"" Joshua said as he leaned in and kissed Gabriel gently on the lips. ""It's going to be nice having someone like you around to keep me company and help me take care of things when my mother is unable to do so.""<br><br>""What did she mean by that?"" Gabriel asked as he pulled back from Joshua and looked at him curiously. ""Is she okay? Did something happen?"" He didn't want anything bad to have happened to his new friend's mother because of him moving in next door, it would just be terrible. He wished that he had been able to get there faster, maybe then they would've met earlier before she had gotten hurt or something. Maybe all this time she'd been waiting for him and now it was too late?<br><br>""Nothing happened,"" Joshua assured him as he rubbed his hand along Gabriel's back soothingly. ""She just doesn't have a lot of energy today and needed a break from taking care of me for a while.""<br><br>""But I'm still",0

Gabriel moves out of his parents' house and into his own apartment.,"As the day approached when Gabriel was to move out of his parents’ house, he began thinking about how it would feel to be alone without them. He was going to be in charge of everything, and all his life he had been in charge of very little.<br><br>He would have to buy groceries, cook meals, pay bills. He would have to take out the garbage, and clean the bathroom. He would have to do all these things for himself.<br><br>And this was just what his parents wanted for him. They had worked hard all their lives so that he could move out of their house and become his own person.<br><br>Gabriel Martin, who was 24 years old, moved out of the parental home to start an independent life on his own. He had lived with his parents all his life, and he never felt like he had done enough for them. So now they were helping him move out.<br><br>Gabriel moved out of the house where he lived most of his life with his two younger sisters, and packed up all of his things into a small blue car. He had been living in this house all these years, and only now did he realize how much stuff he accumulated. Books , CDs, movies, clothes, furniture, kitchen appliances… He had a lot of things.<br><br>He started to pack his small blue car with all of his stuff. His sister’s car was filled up so full that there was no room for any more boxes. Gabriel got in the car with his packed bags, and drove to his new apartment. His family was following him in their own car. His father drove his own blue car, and his mother was sitting beside him. His older sister drove her own red car, and Gabriel’s younger sister rode with her in the  front seat. Gabriel followed them in his own small car, and he was very excited about his new apartment.<br><br>He parked his car in front of the main entrance of the building, and he got out to check if the unit number was right. He looked at it to make sure he was entering the right unit. It was on the second floor, and it had a nice view of a big park right across the street.<br><br>His family arrived behind him in their own cars, and they all entered his new apartment together. Gabriel went into his new bedroom first, and put down all of his boxes there. He moved around furniture to make his new bed, and then he hung up all of his clothes and put his things away in the closet. He made a place for everything in the cabinets and drawers, then he started unpacking all of his stuff. He had organized it by category, so it went quite easily. <br><br>His mother saw that the apartment looked nice, and she told him that it was very nice. His sister also complimented him on his new place, so he was feeling happy.<br><br>Gabriel’s father saw that Gabriel still needed a microwave, and he asked where Gabriel wanted to keep it.",1
Jenna Adams meets Brian Johnson and immediately feels drawn to him.,"Jenna Adams felt a brief and strong panic when she saw Brian Johnson in the parking lot. She had been working at the local library for two years, and she would have expected to have seen him there before. He was three years older than her, in his early thirties, with a boyish charm. He was tall, lean and looked as if he had just walked off the cover of GQ. She wondered if he had been a model at one point in his life.<br><br>The first time Jenna saw him she stopped short in the middle of the aisle between bookshelves and looked up at him, her heart beating faster. Brian Johnson was standing in front of the window looking out into the parking lot, but she could tell that he hadn’t seen her yet.<br><br>Jenna Adams came to a stop beside Brian Johnson and looked at him with wide eyes.<br><br>Brian Johnson turned around and smiled at her, flashing perfect white teeth in Jenna Adams’s face.<br><br>Jenna Adams met Brian Johnson several times after that, but she found herself longing for an invitation to lunch or a cup of coffee just the two of them. She wanted to get to know him better, but they were only casual acquaintances. They had met  in such a chance encounter that Jenna Adams was unsure how to approach him about going out together.<br><br>They did spend time together at the library when she was on break, as he worked part-time at the public library as well. They discussed books and movies and, on one occasion, talked about their families. <br><br>But Jenna Adams wouldn’t allow herself to become too emotionally involved in her relationship with Brian Johnson because she didn’t want to get her hopes up. Jenna Adams had been in love many times before, and no matter how hard she tried to warn herself not to give her heart away too soon, the inevitable happened every single time. Jenna Adams fell madly in love with every person she dated, but they all broke up with her before the first month was over.<br><br>Brian Johnson was different from the other men she had known. He seemed to be genuinely interested in her. But Jenna Adams was careful not to  get her hopes up. She also avoided socializing with Brian Johnson whenever Mary Smith was around, knowing full well that if she ever introduced them, the romance would be over.<br><br>Despite her efforts to maintain a casual relationship with Brian Johnson by only spending time together when Mary Smith was away, Jenna Adams found herself wanting  more. The longer they spent time together, the more Jenna Adams wanted their relationship to go somewhere. On Fridays and Saturdays, especially, she became so excited when she saw Brian Johnson walking down the street or in other public places that she almost ran to catch up with him.<br><br>Jenna Adams felt as though there was something very special between the two of them, and she began to feel more and more hopeful about their future together. She liked Brian Johnson and thought they had a lot in common, but then again, she thought that about all of her ex-boyfriends. Jenna Adams was growing more and more infatuated with Brian Johnson, and she thought that perhaps this was what real love felt like. Maybe marriage wasn’t so bad after all.<br><br>Nevertheless, Brian Johnson’s mother, Mary Smith, disapproved of Jenna Adams and did everything she could to break them up",1
"When Natalie arrives at the address Trevor gave her, she quickly realizes that something isn't right and that Trevor might be a dangerous man .","now that they were in the same room together. Natalie Harper took a sip of her wine and smiled at Trevor Lockwood for a few seconds before answering his question. She told him that she had some ideas and he nodded his head at her.<br><br>Natalie Harper told Trevor Lockwood that she wanted to undress him, and kiss his body as he did the same to her. To add a little more excitement to the situation, she told Trevor Lockwood that they could include some foreplay with their clothes on as well.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was flattered by Natalie Harper’s forward reply and he moved closer to her on the couch. He moved his hand up the inside of Natalie Harper’s thigh and touched her crotch several times before stopping.<br><br>Natalie Harper leaned in to kiss Trevor Lockwood, but he pulled away from her instead. He explained to Natalie Harper that he still had some questions to ask her before moving forward with their plan.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood moved his hand up Natalie Harper’s skirt and he felt her underwear. He moved his fingers back and forth several times before stopping to talk again.<br><br>Natalie Harper was now moving her head back and forth to keep eye contact with Trevor Lockwood. She moved her legs into a more open position so that Trevor Lockwood could have easier access to her panties. She wanted him to move his hand inside of them, but she was going to have to wait a few more minutes before he did.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood moved his other hand up Natalie Harper’s stomach and he gently massaged her breasts through her top. He moved his fingers in a small circular pattern before stopping to talk again.<br><br>There was a small white hotel in the middle of nowhere about an hour from Trevor Lockwood’s small town, a hotel where no one ever went anymore. It would be the perfect place for them to stay in order to get everything they needed done on time.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood moved his hands down from Natalie Harper’s breasts and started unbuttoning her shirt. He pushed the small cotton fabric aside and moved his hands underneath of them to touch her bare breasts.<br><br>Natalie Harper was moving completely out of her comfort zone by agreeing to an in-person meeting with Trevor Lockwood. She was moving further out of it as he moved his hands all over her body, especially when she  could feel his hard cock against her crotch through their clothes.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood touched the soft skin without restraint and Natalie Harper held her breath as he squeezed her large breasts in his hands. He then moved his lips to the area above one of them and kissed the tender skin there.<br><br>Natalie Harper was already feeling turned on by Trevor Lockwood and she knew that when he felt her bare breasts, his arousal would increase. She was a little surprised at how turned on she was herself, considering how nervous she felt as Trevor Lockwood was undressing her. <br><br>Trevor Lockwood parted Natalie Harper’s thighs with his hands as he began to suck on one of her large breasts. After a few seconds, Natalie felt him move closer to her and she knew what was coming next.<br><br>The part of Natalie Harper that was not turned on by this situation was kicking in as Trevor Lockwood spread her legs and buried his face between them. Natalie began to feel a little nervous about the situation. She had never let anyone do that before, not even herself.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood began to kiss the soft skin of Natalie Harper’s inner thighs and she felt her knees grow weak as he licked the area between her legs. Natalie Harper felt her nerves give way to desire as Trevor Lockwood touched her most intimate areas. She began to think about what he was doing and why, and she felt a little uncomfortable that she was so turned on by it all. Trevor Lock wood found this amusing and continued to lick Natalie Harper’s pussy.<br><br>Natalie Harper was beginning to panic as she thought about what Trevor Lockwood was doing between her legs. He had not even touched her pussy yet and she could already feel the strong sensations emanating from it. It occurred to Natalie that Trevor Lockwood might have done this before and that he might be very good at it. Natalie Harper grew more and more nervous as the minutes passed, but she could only focus on what was happening to her body.<br><br>Natalie Harper felt as if she were going crazy. She wanted to stop what was happening, but  her body told her otherwise. She knew that it was “wrong” to let a stranger do this to her and she knew that she should get up and leave, but something inside of her would not allow her to do so.<br><br>She didn’t hear from Trevor after that, and Natalie began",1
"Shannon meets Luke, a young man who helps her with her second book.","a little bit too strange for her. Shannon never spoke about such things as jewelry so there was no chance in which she would have come across it somewhere on a random walk in the mall; this was just a little out of her previous reach and Erin could only wonder what had happened in order for Shannon to be so weird about this whole thing.<br><br>""It's nothing important... Really... It's just some necklace that I bought from some store..."" Shannon said as she looked away from Erin, hoping that she would get distracted from the fact that Shannon knew something weird was going on with this whole situation.<br><br>""You don't seem all right... Maybe you should see someone or something..."" Erin suggested though there was no way in which she had met someone who seemed more healthy than Shannon; there were times when she wondered why they were friends at all because they did not have much in common but somehow, their friendship was still alive and well.<br><br>""I'm fine... Please don't make excuses for me just to go see someone because I cannot deal with anything else besides writing..."" Shannon stressed, hoping that Erin would after all respect her wishes and not try to force anything on her just because of the way everything looked like it should be.<br><br>""You always seem to decide what you should do on your own... This is what I'm here for... You know that..."" Erin said as she tried to calm down a bit because she really did not want to fight with Shannon over something that might not even be that important.<br><br>""I know... I just wanted to make sure..."" Shannon said in a bid to assure Erin that her feelings were not hurt by the things she said.<br><br>""Alright... It was just a suggestion..."" Erin said as she made one last attempt at making sure that Shannon was alright, even though deep down inside, she figured out that there must have been something wrong with her which made her behave the way she had been behaving so far. Hearing all this being mentioned, it only meant one thing and it was something which Erin did not really want to accept but there was no other way in which she could think right now, so there was no other viable option left for her but to think of everything going wrong in Shannon's life and how this would be just another reason for her friend to go crazy.<br><br>""I'm fine..."" Shannon stated again as if she wanted nothing more than for everyone around her to believe that things were going great and even if there was something very odd about this whole situation, Shannon did not want anyone to notice. This was not something that she could explain since she had no idea in which direction things were going to develop. If her father had been around, he might have said something but he was not and Shannon would have to make do with her own decisions.<br><br>""I wish I could believe you..."" Erin said in a bid to stress the point that there was still something wrong with the way things were between them and that Shannon was definitely hiding some specific thing from her which if revealed might as well drive Erin crazy as well as it would be able to break the friendship apart.<br><br>""Just drop it..."" Shannon said as if there was no other option left for her but to make sure that Erin would leave things this way and nothing more than that; she had a lot of weight resting on her shoulders, the least of which were Erin's own concerns.<br><br>""Let's just go see some coffee so we can talk a bit before we go home... I really need you today..."" Erin said with a smile on her face; though she knew things were not going all that great, there was nothing better than getting together with your best friend after a long day at work.<br><br>""I guess I could go for some coffee..."" Shannon said, not really sure if she wanted to deal with Erin but it was better than going home to think things over again and again as well as try to find some answers to life's many questions.<br><br>Erin smiled at Shannon, the way she did so many times in the past few months, all of which when she needed her best friend the most; she might have complained about Shannon's attitude towards life, but deep down inside, she knew that this was the only way in which they could do things and that was something which had worked out in their favor.<br><br>""Let's go to see Starbucks or something... I know there are a lot of people there but I cannot be alone right now..."" Erin said as if she wanted nothing more than for Shannon to tell her what exactly was going on with her and even though Erin believed that something had been finally revealed, there was no point trying to pressurize Shannon right now. There were moments when you needed someone and you simply did not want them to leave your side at any given moment because they were your support system.<br><br>""I want a cinnamon roll from Starbucks..."" Shannon said with a smile on her face; there was no way she could just sit there and do nothing when the girl she had loved for so many years was trying to get closer to her.<br><br>""What? A cinnamon roll?"" Erin asked, not really sure if she had heard what Shannon had said or not but even if that was the case, there was no way she would have processed all of it.<br><br>""You heard me..."" Shannon said as she tried to make her way back to her seat and pick up a pen and some paper in order for her to draw a picture of what she wanted.<br><br>""Are you sure that you have been feeling fine... I mean... you did not even talk about anything else but work..."" Erin said as the thoughts which were running through her mind simply refused to let go of them; Shannon's father might very well be dead at this moment and there was nothing they could do about it besides wait.<br><br>""I'm fine... Really..."" Shannon said as if everything was going great and that there was nothing wrong with the fact that Luke might never wake up again in his entire life; he would be just another statistic on the long list of people who had gone before him.<br><br>Erin nodded in response,",0
"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","Jenna Riley stood in the doorway of her family’s blue bungalow, sipping on a cold glass of milk. The air was warm and humid, and Jenna felt heavy in the muggy heat. She had worked the midnight shift at the diner all night long, and it was now four in the morning. Jenna was exhausted from working, and she wished that she could go home to her apartment soon. She passed a few other people on the sidewalk on her way home. They all wore clothes that were too warm for how humid it was outside that early in the morning. Jenna stopped to chat with one of her coworkers. Jenna wished that she worked during the day shift, like him. It would be easier on her body and easier for her to do errands during the day, rather than at night. She would have to wait until after ten thirty before she could go home and rest. She had time for a quick nap  before she had to leave for work again.<br><br>Jenna was carrying a big brown bag of books in one hand and her keys in the other as she walked down the street. She stopped to look at a flyer about a community event. As she was looking through the pages, someone grabbed her shoulder and spun her around behind her. The mugger pressed his hand over her mouth and pulled out a gun.<br><br>“Do anything stupid,” he warned, “and I’ll shoot you in the head and leave you in this alley, just like your friend.”<br><br>He was talking about the poor girl who had been found murdered in the alley behind the diner a few weeks ago. Jenna had often walked through that same alley on her way home from work. She wished that she hadn’t been too tired this morning to walk a different route.<br><br>Jenna tried to scream, but the mugger clamped his hand tighter over her mouth. When he let go of her shoulder, Jenna took advantage and ran for the doors of the library across the street. There were several people inside, working on their laptops or sitting in cozy chairs reading magazines.<br><br>“Help!” Jenna shouted, but the people either looked up from their work or kept reading. No one bothered to come out and help her.<br><br>The mugger ran up to her, grabbed at the bag of books she was holding, and screamed, “Give me your stupid books! Now!”<br><br>Jenna dropped the plastic-wrapped books, but the mugger tripped on his own feet, allowing Jenna to escape. As he stood up, he pulled out a gun and pointed it at Jenna.<br><br>Jenna knew that she couldn’t outrun him.<br><br>“Get over here or I’ll blow your brains out,” the mugger barked.<br><br>Jenna stepped closer to the man, giving him no other choice but to pull the trigger. When a shot rang out, Jenna instinctively ducked and found herself on the ground. It felt like her cheek was burning, but she couldn’t be sure.<br><br>The mugger laughed and knelt down next to her. “You made it easy for me, bitch,” he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette lighter. He looked down at Jenna  and smiled. “When I’m done with you, you won’t be able to walk home from your shift at the diner anymore.”<br><br>The mugger stood up and ignited the lighter. Jenna closed her eyes and felt a sharp pain in her face as the mugger pressed the hot end of the lighter against Jenna’s cheek. She heard a sizzle and when she opened her eyes, she saw the mugger staring at her.<br><br>Jenna sat up and coughed, blood spewing out of her mouth. She looked around and saw the mugger lighting another cigarette;  he was still sitting on the ground next to her. Jenna screamed as loud as she could and lunged forward at the mugger, knocking him off balance. The mugger fell backwards and screamed in pain as he fell onto some broken glass.<br><br>Jenna stood up, but was too weak to get very far. She stumbled to the other side of the alley and collapsed against a wall. She looked down at her hands and saw that they were covered in blood. Her shirt was also stained with blood, and she could feel it slowly seeping into her jeans.<br><br>The mugger got back to his feet and turned around; he was holding the lighter as if preparing for another attack. Jenna’s vision started to go dark, and she stumbled forward, trying to reach the diner. She reached her arms out as if to brace herself against the wall, but all she hit were cold bricks.<br><br>Jenna then felt a sharp sting in her side; she looked down and saw that she was bleeding profusely. She slowly sank to the ground, and began coughing up more blood. The mugger walked out of the alley after he saw that Jenna was lying motionless on the ground. He picked up his sunglasses from the ground and put them back on his face.<br><br>Jenna suddenly came to, and forced herself onto her knees. She heard sirens just outside the alley, and tried to crawl in the direction of the diner’s entrance. It was hard going, but she managed to make it to the door. She was about to use her hands to open it when she realized that her hand was completely covered in blood.<br><br>She then heard a voice, “It’s okay, just lean on me.” When she looked up, Damian Henchman was helping Jenna out behind the diner. Jenna coughed and spat out some blood onto the ground. She began coughing again, and then collapsed on the ground.<br><br>Jenna came to again, and this time, she found herself in a white-walled hospital room with a man in his mid twenties standing at her bedside. Jenna looked up at him, and noticed that he had long blond hair and blue eyes. His face was covered with deep, red scars. He wore a white shirt and pants that were tucked into black combat boots. He was holding Jenna’s hand, and stared back at her.",1

Steven asked me; ""I don't understand why you think of yourself as so much better than everyone else.""""I don't think of myself as better,"" I said but I'm not sure that Steven heard me because he was talking again.""Cal's helpful, you know,"" Steven said; ""the teachers like him and the younger kids like him too - there's even a rumor going around that Cal doesn't really have a father but there's no proof that it's true. If it is true though, then it kind of explains why Cal is the way he is - maybe his father left him and his mother died when he was young and then his grandfather threw him out on the streets or something.

Did he tell you something bad about your mother or maybe about me?""""How could you possibly know what Cal would tell me - it's not like we're friends or anything,"" I told him.""Cal is a real asshole towards everyone,"" Steven said, ""he deserves it if the teachers don't like him. He treats everyone like shit and he doesn't care about anyone but himself.""""I wonder why he isn't in jail then,"" I said. ""It sounds like that's where someone like him would be if all the teachers really thought that way.""""No one really knows why Cal isn't in jail - there was this one time when they caught Cal stealing money from his teacher's desk,"" Steven told me; ""it was only twenty dollars so they could have just overlooked it but instead, they let Cal go with a warning just because of everything that had happened in the past. They said that the principal didn't think someone like Cal needed to be sent to jail just because of something like that. Everyone was worried about Cal though, especially his uncle - he said that they should have thrown Cal in jail and then he punched the principal in the face.""""Did they send Cal to jail then?"" I asked.""No,"" Steven told me; ""they just told him not to do it again and then they pretty much let it go at that. It was a lot of hard work for everyone but they all decided it was better than throwing Cal in jail just because of some petty crime.""I nodded my head; I could understand why everyone would want to leave Cal alone instead of throwing him in jail - after all, nobody really deserved to be sent to prison for stealing twenty dollars - but I still thought there must have been some other way for them to correct the situation without simply letting him off with a warning - what if he'd really been stealing thousands and thousands of dollars? How could anyone possibly allow something like that?""I'm out of here,"" Steven said suddenly and he got up from his seat; ""did you hear me? I'm not going back home tonight - I'll sleep somewhere around here.""I stood up too (my legs felt a bit weak) and I looked at Steven; I kind of wondered why he was being so stubborn about this but then I realized that this was his way of coping with the situation (or something like that). He wasn't going to just accept his mother's death and move on - why would anyone move on from something like that? It was impossible.""Are you sure it's a good idea to sleep around here?"" I asked Steven. ""Cal is out there doing God knows what - and if he finds you, what do you think he'll do to you?""""Cal won't find me,"" Steven said confidently. ""He doesn't even know where we went today - and even if he did know, it wouldn't matter because he wouldn't be able to find me.""I had the strangest feeling that Cal would be able to find us no matter where we went, no matter how well we hid ourselves but of course, there was no point in saying anything about that now.""Okay,"" I said blankly; ""good luck then.""I started walking towards my car - Dad had dropped me off earlier so that meant it was only about two minutes drive from here to my house.""Eve!"" Steven called after me.I turned around and looked at him. He was standing there, just like before, staring at me with those same intense eyes that seemed to pierce through my heart.""Don't forget about me, okay?"" Steven said. ""You're the only one who's ever understood me - you're the only one that's ever listened to me and seen past all of this.""""I won't forget about you,"" I told him. ""I promise.""""I'll find you when I'm ready,"" Steven said; ""and then we'll get out of here - I want to experience a life outside of this town.""""I'd like that,"" I told him. ""Write to me or call me or something - let me know what happens...""""Alright,"" Steven said; and then he turned around and walked off into the darkness of night...I had barely driven away from the curb before I started crying again. As soon as I was on my own, away from everyone else (especially Cal), I couldn't help but start crying again; but unlike all those other times when Cal wasn't around, this time was different because someone else was watching over me...It had been almost two hours since Dad picked us up from school. Ted and Steven were sitting in the front seat while Dad drove us back home and as",0

"When Jack is alone, he talks to her.","laid in bed, holding each other, crying for a long time. Eventually they fell asleep and Jack woke up after a couple of hours – he didn’t even realize that he had fallen asleep – to find her lying next to him, sound asleep. He lay there watching her sleep for a while before getting up to go to the bathroom. As he was walking back, she opened her eyes and looked up at him.<br><br>“Jack? Are you okay?”<br><br>He came back closer to the bed and answered, “I’m fine. I just had something important to tell you. Can we talk?”<br><br>“Of course. Go ahead.”<br><br>“Eliza, remember that day last summer when we got each other flowers and went out on our first date? Remember how much fun we had? Remember how happy we were?” Jack continued.<br><br>“Of course. You told me about it every day since then too.” she said with a smile on her face. “Tell me about today then.”<br><br>Jack paused for a moment and thought about it. “Today I felt the same way as I did day. Except today, the flowers weren’t because of you. They were from my new boss to tell me about my new job tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning, I start working again after six months off to take care of you. That job is the reason why I haven’t gone completely insane yet.” Jack said this last part with a sigh and then thought about it again. “I don’t know, maybe my days just feel so long because we haven’t properly celebrated my birthday yet. Maybe we should do that tomorrow night?” he asked her. “Just us two? I promise I’ll tell you about my new job then too.”<br><br>Jack smiled. “That sounds like fun. Let’s do it then; just you and me, okay?”<br><br>Jack nodded and she smiled again, this time bigger than before. Jack told her about his day and he told her about the latest news. He told her about everything from his new boss to Donald Trump and then back to his new job again. He talked about everything he did that day and all of the things that he didn’t do too. He talked about everything that happened  in his house, from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to bed. He told her about his dreams and his hopes and how he only got an hour of sleep last night because he just couldn’t stop thinking about her.<br><br>Halfway through, Eliza stopped listening. Her smile had disappeared and her face had dropped into her hands again. Jack stopped talking but continued to smile at her. He continued to look at the living room wall and he could tell that she didn’t hear him anymore. Jack knew she didn’t want to hear him say everything that he was saying, but he did anyway. He kept talking because he thought it would help, but now it was making things worse.<br><br>Jack watched her face as tears trickled down her cheeks and he could hear her sobbing. The living room door opened and closed softly as Eliza walked away from him, into the kitchen. Jack sat on the living room couch and watched her try to wipe her face with one hand while holding a wine glass with the other.<br><br>“Eliza?” Jack asked her. She didn’t answer him, but moved to the refrigerator and opened it.<br><br>“Did you go to the store?” she said to no one.<br><br>Jack moved toward her slowly, his legs weak. His eyes were filling with tears again now that he saw her crying. He didn’t want her to cry alone and he wanted to say everything that he thought might make her feel better, but he moved slowly because he was unsure if she wanted to hear it.<br><br>“I know you don’t want to hear me talk about it,” Jack said to her. He moved closer and stood behind her as she leaned against the fridge door.<br><br>“But I can’t stop,” he continued. “Every time I open my mouth you move away from me, but I need to tell you what happened today and how your life is going to be better soon now that I have this job and we can move.”<br><br>She moved away from the fridge and turned around to face him. She looked at him and then over his shoulder.<br><br>“Move?” she asked.<br><br>“I got a new job, a good one, and we can move now that I have the money, and if you  want to go somewhere warm, we can go anywhere you want. There are so many places and I can take you to -”<br><br>“We?” she asked. She looked down at her feet. “What do you mean ‘we?’”<br><br>Jack sat down on the floor in front of her. “But you can come along, you can be there with me, we can talk about anything and everything -”<br><br>Eliza stood up and moved away from him. She turned back to him quickly though and said, “You say we as if I’m not here,” she said.<br><br>She moved again and went to the bedroom. She opened the door but didn’t enter. She moved closer to the door and looked inside.<br><br>Jack followed her into the bedroom. He looked around at the bed - a single bed - and then at Eliza.<br><br>“I moved your clothes,” she said. “And I tried to change things around, but it’s still the same bedroom, it’s still the same house. But you never move on, do you? You just sit here and you go through the motions of moving on, but that’s all you do. You don’t actually move on, you just sit here and talk to me like I’m not actually gone. Like this is some sort of delusion and I haven’t actually left you. Like  I’ll be coming back one day. Like my death isn’t final, that it isn’t final. You can move on but I can’t, or you won’t let me?” she said.<br><br>Jack didn’t know how to reply to this. He stared at her for a second and then turned away.<br><br>“You know, you never did tell me where this new place is,” she said.<br><br>Jack turned around again to look at Eliza and thought about the answer. The room was empty except for Eliza and him, but it felt crowded now.<br><br>“It’s in the city, on the other side of town. It’s only about twenty miles from here. Just over there along the coast,” he said.<br><br>Eliza frowned and turned toward the window instead of Jack. She moved the curtain aside to look out. “Well at least it’s on the coast,” she said.<br><br>Jack moved a little bit closer to her and placed his hand on her arm. The movement startled her and she looked at him with an expression of surprise. She moved away from him and turned toward the side of the bed instead.<br><br>“Why are you moving?” she asked. “Aren’t you happy here? I mean, this is where we lived together, isn’t it? You know, when we were happy. This is the room that we shared.”<br><br>Jack moved a few steps closer to her and then sat down on the edge of the bed next to her. He was silent for a moment, but then continued to speak.<br><br>“It’s not that I don’t want to live here. I live here at the moment because I have nothing else, but that can change. I want to move out there so that we can be together again, you and me. We can be happy together and live in a nice house near the ocean, where it is green and warm all year round. It doesn’t snow there, does it?”<br><br>Eliza moved a little closer to him again and looked into his eyes.<br><br>“Tell me,” she said softly. “Why move to this place? Isn’t it just like our old place? Why not move somewhere",1
"Kyle Johnson, a man Aimee met at work, comes over to visit and the two quickly become friends.","coming from a few blocks away. ""You could get in a lot of trouble if she does end up...""<br><br>""I'll go back to the apartment,"" said the woman, cutting Aimee off before she could finish her sentence. ""But I don't think I can stay there alone right now..."" Her voice sounded almost distant, as if she were thinking about something else instead of paying attention to what Aimee was saying.<br><br>""I'll find a hotel room,"" said the man quickly. ""If my wife stays with me then I can't leave her alone and I'm not going to stay in a hotel room without her when she needs me..."" The sirens grew louder and louder as they pulled up behind Aimee, who was still watching the two of them silently.<br><br>""You're on your way home anyway,"" said Aimee finally, talking over the sound of the sirens that were getting closer. ""So you should just go back together."" She turned around and took a few big steps away from them so that they would be able to hear each other over the sirens, then glanced over her shoulder one last time before starting to walk faster. They shouldn't have to be separated; it wasn't fair for either one of them.<br><br>""You know,"" said the man suddenly, sounding surprisingly amused. ""I think you're a good girl, Aimee..."" He was walking away from his wife now, so Aimee didn't even have the opportunity to respond to his comment before hearing the woman say that she agreed with that statement as well. They were talking about her but she didn't even know their names or what they did or anything else about them... How could they have possibly known it was impossible for them to be separated...? It was clear that they wanted each other's company; it shouldn't have been possible for them to be separated no matter what happened. They shouldn't have been separated in the first place!<br><br>""..."" Aimee turned around and watched as the two of them waved one last time before disappearing around a corner, then sighed sadly and shook her head. ""Good girl,"" she muttered to herself with a small smile, thinking about how meaningful those words were coming from someone who didn't know her at all. ""Maybe I really am..."" She shook her head again and started walking forward towards her apartment again; there wasn't any point in staying out here when she had so much work left to do today!<br><br>As soon as the young woman finally got home and settled down, she could hear the sound of another siren in the distance. It was a little bit quieter than the last one and seemed to be coming from within a couple blocks of her apartment; it was probably just fire trucks stopping at some building for some reason or another. Aimee didn't really care what they were doing, though; she had already started working on her next post, so she just turned up her music even louder and continued writing.<br><br>She couldn't wait to go to sleep tonight; it had been a long day! Once she finished up with this post, she would have exactly one hundred articles published! Once that happened, she would probably feel really good about herself for a while... Aimee smiled happily at the thought of that, then started typing quickly again. She would have a lot of work ahead of her if she wanted to hit one hundred individual posts by tomorrow evening... But that didn't matter because this was her dream and Aimee knew that everything else was going to fall into place eventually! She was going to be successful in whatever career path or life path she chose for herself; there were no doubts about that at all.<br><br>A/N: I'm pretty sure I just made up the name of this imaginary band, haha.<br><br>“But really, I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. Should I go to school and get a degree in something?” Lola asked as they dragged themselves through another day of work. “I mean…I’m twenty-one and I have no idea what I want to do with my life… What do you think?”<br><br>Her best friend, who was currently eating his lunch at his desk even though it was only afternoon, gave her a sarcastic look that clearly said “You don’t care about this at all so why are you asking me?” “Do whatever makes you happy, Lola. That should be your only concern. If you love what you do then it doesn’t matter how much money you make or if it only gets you by…you need to be happy doing what it is that makes you happy. That’s all that matters to me,” he replied solemnly between bites of food.<br><br>Lola nodded before turning back towards her computer and the blank word processing document she had opened up not even an hour ago; she didn't know if she should go back to the beginning or try and continue where she had left off before.<br><br>“I just don’t know if I can do this anymore. I can’t find a real meaning in anything I do anymore…” Lola said quietly as she stared into the computer screen. “I think it might be time for me to start thinking about going back to school for nursing… It’s an idea, anyways… Well, that was a close one! It was almost midnight but you made it, everyone! Today starts my new series on what it means to be successful in the world of online writing. This series is going to have a lot of lessons in it, some of them coming from personal experience and many others coming from research that I have done...but not without some help from my followers here on ! Today we are going to talk about what success tastes like; so let's get right into it!Today's article is all about knowing what you want out of life and establishing goals for yourself before you even think about trying to make money doing something you love...or as someone told me once--not loving what you do but doing something you love.

Kyle comforts Aimee and the two share a heart-to-heart conversation that leaves Aimee feeling understood for the first time.,"over her as he looked down at her and whispered. ""I could feel you hurting....I just know you were going through something so I came here to help....I'm here for you, okay? Just let me in...I can help."" He brushed his thumb over her bottom lip before leaning in to kiss her softly. “Don’t cry, sweetheart. Please. And remember that I’m always here for you….for whatever you need me to be…just tell me how I can fix this.”""It's just.....you're not the one who needs fixing."" She pulled away slightly before looking at him with a sad smile; Lola took a deep breath before swallowing hard and speaking again. ""You've been so great through all of this but Kyle.....it's just not enough anymore.....it has nothing to do with you."" She lowered her head slightly as she reached up and rubbed the back of her neck.""No....no...Lola...don't say that....don't say anything like that....please."" Kyle reached out and cupped her cheek in his hand before leaning down and kissing her on the nose gently; he moved his lips close to hers as he whispered into them lightly. ""Don't leave me, don't leave me for him....he can't make you happy, he doesn't know how to....he doesn't care about you like I do. Please don't be with him; please be with me instead.""Lola swallowed hard as she sat up and wrapped her arms around Kyle's shoulders tightly before pulling him down onto the bed and leaning against his chest as she spoke again. ""You just don’t understand, Kyle. None of this makes sense but I just can’t help it....I have to try….I know that it could ruin everything but...but I just have to try. He makes me feel understood and at peace in a way that I haven’t felt in a while...I need that now."" She shook her head slightly before moving back slightly so she could look up at Kyle again.""He doesn't love you...he doesn't even like you....all he cares about is himself and getting what he wants. You're not even an obstacle for him, Lola; you're nothing to him....don't give up your whole life for someone that doesn't love or appreciate you."" Kyle’s hands trailed over her back as he spoke softly into her ear before whispering softly once more into her ear. ""Don't be with him....be with me instead.""Lola swallowed hard as she shook her head and backed away from Kyle once again; she looked at him again before taking a deep breath and speaking. “You’re wrong, Kyle. He does understand me in a way that you don’t...it’s just different.....he’s not you....he doesn’t know how to fix me like you do but he makes me feel understood and safe and that’s all I need right now. I don’t want you to be frustrated because of this; I know that...I know it has nothing to do with you but I can’t change the way that I feel, okay? It would kill me if it hurt us but...but I just have to try this. Everything will be okay, I promise."" Kyle's heart sank as Lola continued to speak but he slowly nodded as she spoke again. ""Everything will be okay....I'll always love you, Kyle.....I know that we're just temporary now but...but...please don't be angry with me or disappointed in me or anything."" He nodded slowly at her before dropping his head back against the pillow under him; he closed his eyes and shook his head slightly as Lola ran her fingers through his hair. ""You’re not changing your mind are you?"" he whispered once more before clenching his jaw and shaking his head again.""I don't know, Kyle.....I just don’t know."" She sighed softly before standing up off of the bed once again; Kyle sat up slightly as she looked at him one last time before speaking. ""I have to go home now.....everything will be okay, I promise."" She walked towards the door slowly before turning her head and looking at him one last time; she smiled slightly as she spoke. ""Goodnight, Kyle."" He nodded in response as she quickly walked out of the room; he took a deep breath before getting up off of the bed and walking over to the chair next to the window. He sat down heavily in it before laying his head back against it and closing his eyes again. He could feel tears begin to drip from them but he just couldn't stop himself...he still hoped that Lola would change her mind but he knew that she wouldn't. He had always known that she was weak...that she would never truly be strong enough for him....but now....now because of Jack....he was the reason that she had become so weak. He knew that she never should have been with him in the first place but...but now....they were both changed and he couldn't fix this anymore....he couldn't fix her anymore. He closed his eyes tightly before letting out a deep and loud sigh; he knew that he shouldn't be so angry at her for what she was doing but...but for some reason even he didn't understand, he just couldn't help the way that he felt. His heart sank as the words drifted through his mind once more and then, just as quickly as they had come, they disappeared once again before he could fully register them. He leaned down slightly so his head was lying in his lap before taking several deep breaths to try and calm himself. His mind began to fill with thoughts of Aimee now; thoughts of how when she ran away from him after meeting Jack earlier, it felt like someone had ripped out his heart or soul because of how much it hurt him to see her running away from him like that....he knew then how much she meant to him because of how much he felt when they parted ways....and then there was Lola....the way that their entire relationship had been starting to change lately because of everything between them",0
The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,". “Just stay in the hall!”<br><br>Tim was frozen with fear and confusion. “What are you doing?” he asked quietly.<br><br>Julia took a deep breath and turned to Thelma. “Please get me out of here,” she said with difficulty, her voice barely audible. “I think that I’m going to be sick.”<br><br>Thelma nodded and reached for the door, but a loud crashing noise made her freeze in her tracks. Julia had turned around and saw the large dark figures moving towards them. It did not quite look like they were moving, but more like they were flowing. Then the other door opened and the little girl came walking slowly into the room.<br><br>“I am here with your doctor,” she said calmly and smiled at Julia. “He says that he will be able to help you relax and get your thoughts and feelings in order.”<br><br>Thelma moved quickly to the girl’s side and forced her back out of the door. She turned around to face the doctor.<br><br>“What are you doing here? Why are you treating my daughter this way? Why can’t I come in there with her?”<br><br>The doctor looked around the room, as if searching for an answer. He found none and started to move towards the door. “I need to talk to the patient alone, Mrs. Bates. Please wait in the hallway and out of sight until I call you back in.”<br><br>The doctor moved to the door and held it open, but Thelma had moved out of his way. She stood calmly in front of him, blocking his exit.<br><br>“No sir. You will not move from this office until you explain your intentions to this young lady and me and our doctor.”<br><br>The doctor seemed to stare at her for a full minute before he spoke again. “Are you the patient’s mother?”<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>“Do you believe your daughter needs medical or psychiatric treatment?”<br><br>Thelma moved her head slowly in a nod and waited for the doctor to speak. His voice was very calm and monotone as he replied, “I believe your daughter may need medical treatment, but not psychiatric therapy at this time. I recommend that she be seen at the local hospital , where we can give her medical attention and keep her under sedation until the medication starts to take effect.”<br><br>Thelma pulled her body straighter and showed no emotion on her face. “We will provide those services here, Doctor.”<br><br>The doctor shook his head slowly. “I cannot recommend that course of action. I believe it would be in the best interest of your daughter for her to be seen by a specialist at the hospital in Raleigh.”<br><br>Thelma nodded slowly and lowered her head.  “You will cooperate with us, Doctor. If you don’t, I will have you dismissed from this hospital and never allow you to practice medicine again in this county. I am an officer of the law and know how these matters are handled.”<br><br>Timothy Jenks stood and walked swiftly to the door. He opened it and stepped out into the hall. Thelma followed quickly. “Come with me, young lady,” she said as she led Julia out the door.<br><br>Thelma walked silently down the corridor and stopped in front of a closed door. They turned to look at Julia. She was trembling on the verge of panic. “Don’t worry, honey. It will be okay,” Thelma said as she entered the room and closed the door behind her. She walked to the bed and sat on the edge beside Julia.<br><br>Julia looked up at Thelma and started to cry. “What are they going to do with me, Mama?”<br><br>Thelma’s expression changed from one of seething anger to that of a loving mother. She walked slowly to Julia, put her arms around her, and held her close. “Oh, honey. I’m sorry. They are not going to do anything except listen to you and help you get well.”<br><br>“They? What do you mean? You mean they will just listen to me talk about this stuff? That’s all? ”<br><br>As she spoke, Thelma realized that Julia was thinking of going to a psychiatrist. She was relieved that the town doctor refused to heed Thelma’s request. Now, looking into her daughter’s face, she could see the fear and uncertainty that Julia was facing. “Yes, honey. They will listen to you and—“<br><br>Suddenly there was a sound at the door. Thelma turned and saw Karen Jones standing in the doorway of the bedroom. “The doctor wants to talk to you, Dr. Martin. They moved up your appointment.”<br><br>Thelma turned back around to face Julia and continued, “They moved up your appointment because I insisted they do so.” She smiled reassuringly at her daughter and then added, “They are going to  help you get well and I am sure everything will be fine.”<br><br>Julia hesitated, then asked, “So why are you crying?” Thelma turned away as the tears streamed down her face. Julia looked at Karen for understanding, but she had already gone back into the kitchen.<br><br>In the next few minutes, it became clear to Julia that more than one person in town was disturbed by the recent events. First, Julia’s friends avoided her, and when she spoke to them on the telephone they had little to say about anything. Then, one day a group of high school girls came by Julia’s house and began screaming at her.<br><br>“You are possessed by the devil! Get out of town! Go away! We don’t want you here anymore! Get out of town or we will kill you!” Julia was taken completely by surprise her and did not know how to react. She began crying uncontrollably.<br><br>Thelma came running out of the house with a pan in her hand, screaming at the girls to leave her daughter alone. Thelma then turned her attention back to Julia and said, “Julia, I’m so sorry. Please don’t cry. Just leave when you can and never come back here again. Please stop crying Julia, for my sake if not your own.”<br><br>Julia stood outside her house, crying and listening to the screams of the girls moving up the street. Finally, Julia left her house and ran as fast as she could into town. She ran until she could no longer run. She found herself at the town square, collapsed on the grass crying and gasping for air. She was breathing so heavily that it was difficult for her to speak, but Julia managed to say, “I don’t know what’s happening to me. I don’t think I can stay here anymore. Please help me! Please do something! Please make this stop!”<br><br>Julia did not know what else to say. She was exhausted and out of breath. Julia felt alone and scared. Julia sat in the town square, surrounded by trees and empty benches, and cried. Julia cried because she was scared, because she felt alone, because she did not know how to fix what was happening to her, and because she just did not want to feel this way",1

Jenna Adams meets Brian Johnson and immediately feels drawn to him.,"Jenna Adams felt a brief and strong panic when she saw Brian Johnson in the parking lot. She had been working at the local library for two years, and she would have expected to have seen him there before. He was three years older than her, in his early thirties, with a boyish charm. He was tall, lean and looked as if he had just walked off the cover of GQ. She wondered if he had been a model at one point in his life.<br><br>The first time Jenna saw him she stopped short in the middle of the aisle between bookshelves and looked up at him, her heart beating faster. Brian Johnson was standing in front of the window looking out into the parking lot, but she could tell that he hadn’t seen her yet.<br><br>Jenna Adams came to a stop beside Brian Johnson and looked at him with wide eyes.<br><br>Brian Johnson turned around and smiled at her, flashing perfect white teeth in Jenna Adams’s face.<br><br>Jenna Adams met Brian Johnson several times after that, but she found herself longing for an invitation to lunch or a cup of coffee just the two of them. She wanted to get to know him better, but they were only casual acquaintances. They had met  in such a chance encounter that Jenna Adams was unsure how to approach him about going out together.<br><br>They did spend time together at the library when she was on break, as he worked part-time at the public library as well. They discussed books and movies and, on one occasion, talked about their families. <br><br>But Jenna Adams wouldn’t allow herself to become too emotionally involved in her relationship with Brian Johnson because she didn’t want to get her hopes up. Jenna Adams had been in love many times before, and no matter how hard she tried to warn herself not to give her heart away too soon, the inevitable happened every single time. Jenna Adams fell madly in love with every person she dated, but they all broke up with her before the first month was over.<br><br>Brian Johnson was different from the other men she had known. He seemed to be genuinely interested in her. But Jenna Adams was careful not to  get her hopes up. She also avoided socializing with Brian Johnson whenever Mary Smith was around, knowing full well that if she ever introduced them, the romance would be over.<br><br>Despite her efforts to maintain a casual relationship with Brian Johnson by only spending time together when Mary Smith was away, Jenna Adams found herself wanting  more. The longer they spent time together, the more Jenna Adams wanted their relationship to go somewhere. On Fridays and Saturdays, especially, she became so excited when she saw Brian Johnson walking down the street or in other public places that she almost ran to catch up with him.<br><br>Jenna Adams felt as though there was something very special between the two of them, and she began to feel more and more hopeful about their future together. She liked Brian Johnson and thought they had a lot in common, but then again, she thought that about all of her ex-boyfriends. Jenna Adams was growing more and more infatuated with Brian Johnson, and she thought that perhaps this was what real love felt like. Maybe marriage wasn’t so bad after all.<br><br>Nevertheless, Brian Johnson’s mother, Mary Smith, disapproved of Jenna Adams and did everything she could to break them up",1
Jenna wakes up in the hospital a week later to find that she is now a vampire.,"the speakers were blaring loudly. ""Jenna?"" Matthias said with a puzzled voice. ""What's wrong? Where are you? I can barely hear you.""<br><br>The man cleared his throat as he said, ""Tell him to meet us at the abandoned amusement park down by the river as soon as possible.""<br><br>Jenna nodded her head before saying, ""Matthias? It's me. Something happened and...and I need you to meet me at the abandoned amusement park down by the river as soon as possible.""<br><br>Even though it was hard to hear what she was saying because of all of the music in the background, Matthias quickly replied, ""Okay Jenna. What happened? You're not making any sense. Have you been drinking again?""<br><br>""I'm not drunk!"" Jenna said as she covered her face with her hand and hung up on him because she was too distraught to talk or say anything else. She stared off into space for several seconds while trying to figure out whether she should even tell him what really happened or not because if he didn't show up then that would leave him open to being attacked by the guy with a sword and killed too.<br><br>The man sighed before walking over towards Jenna and holding the sword over her face as he said, ""If you don't call him again, I'll kill you right here, right now. Got it?""<br><br>Jenna held up her hands in surrender before saying, ""Okay! I'm calling him.""<br><br>A few seconds later she had Matthias on the phone again and this time she didn't even talk to him. She hung up on him again after just putting the phone to her ear, figuring that that would be enough of a message for him to get the point without actually telling him what was going on. Jenna then threw her cell phone to the floor and then fell to her knees as tears began rolling down her face.<br><br>The man sighed loudly before walking around behind them again and sounding slightly frustrated when he said, ""There's no way he's coming now. Do you have any other friends? Anyone else that can come?""<br><br>Jenna shook her head sadly before saying, ""No.""<br><br>The man rubbed his forehead with his free hand as he paced back and forth behind them while holding his sword out at them in one hand while trying to think of what to do next. Suddenly it seemed like an idea popped into his head because he stopped pacing, turned towards them, and said, ""Okay. I think I've got a plan.""<br><br>***<br><br>That evening Lieutenant John Dorsey II of the Chicago Police Department started off his shift just like any other day. He was currently driving down the highway towards his job in his patrol car as he listened to some music on the radio and looked out the window at all of the people walking along on the sidewalks below. From what he could see from up here it was a beautiful sunny day and there were two or three times as many people out today than there usually were.<br><br>Suddenly John's cell phone started ringing in his pocket and pulled it out, raising an eyebrow as his name flashed across the screen of his phone before he pressed talk on it and held it up to his ear. ""This is John Dorsey,"" he said into the phone. ""Who's calling?""<br><br>One Friday night a couple months back John had got a call from Jenna over at her home after she had gotten in a huge fight with her boyfriend. She had kicked him out because she didn't want him around anymore but when she woke up on Saturday morning to find that he hadn't left yet she wanted him gone, so she called John because he was the only other one that she knew that was around. When he showed up at Jenna's house he had found her upset about what had happened and Matthias Calenski in her kitchen, telling her that if she didn't give him another chance then it was over between them permanently. John had told Matthias to leave without any further explanation and after threatening to kill him if he didn't, he did.<br><br>Because of this John recognized the name on his cell phone when he saw it flash up on the screen so he smiled slightly and said into the phone, ""Hey there little lady. What's going on tonight?""<br><br>""Please help me,"" Jenna said in a voice that was cracking with sobs as she tried to hold back tears. ""Please.""<br><br>""What's wrong? Are you okay?"" John asked as he quickly slowed down his car and pressed the brake as hard as it would go as he tried to figure out where she was calling from. ""Is it Matthias again? I told you to leave him alone if I ever heard from you again.""<br><br>Jenna shook her head but still managed a few tears before saying, ""No. It's not Matthias.""<br><br>""Then what is it?"" John asked. ""What do you need help with?""<br><br>""Please come and get me,"" Jenna said. ""I don't really want to talk about it over the phone.""<br><br>John rubbed his forehead and sighed before saying, ""We can't keep doing this Jenna. We're friends but I can only do so much for you.""<br><br>""Please,"" Jenna said again as she began crying harder.<br><br>As John listened to her beg him he was sure that she sounded like she was in more trouble than she had been in before and although he wasn't too happy about him having to help her every time that her boyfriend got too aggressive on her, he was always willing to help a friend if it meant getting them away from a bad situation. ""Alright,"" he said after bit as he pressed the gas pedal down harder on his car and sped off down the highway at breakneck speeds. ""I'll be there in five minutes.""<br><br>***<br><br>When John knocked on the door of Jenna's house ten minutes later no one answered it so he took out his cell phone and called her again, listening as the phone rang only once before she picked up and brought it up to her ear.

Trevor Lockwood ends up being a serial killer who lures women to their death and Natalie narrowly escapes becoming his next victim .,"night and they start flirting with each other. She has a drunken one night stand with him and later learns that he actually is a lot older than he told her (in his mid-30's) and actually works as a photographer for a magazine. While working on one of his photography assignments, Natalie goes to the location of his shoot (a dark warehouse) and then realizes that it was actually all fake; there was no magazine or anything else. She also finds out that she's been led there in order to have sex with him in order to 're-shoot' the pictures of the model who got sick. When Natalie refuses, Trevor becomes violent towards her physically by trying to push her into having sex with him against her will.<br><br>Emotions: Natalie feels betrayed; this is because she was lied to by Trevor about who he really was and that he had intentions of raping her by doing the photo shoot under false pretenses. She feels worried that she may have gotten drugged or raped at some point during their sexual encounter because she can't remember any details about what happened between them but this is something she tries not to dwell on since she doesn't want to think about it any further than necessary. She also feels uneasy because she knows that every time someone walks through the apartment complex she lives in that they could really be the potential killer that she was in danger of meeting the other night.<br><br>Motivations: Natalie wants to find out who this strange man really is, but doesn't have any means of doing so. This is because she doesn't know who he actually is and feels too scared to even go to the police about what happened since she already made-out with him and had sex with him once before. She wants to find out where he lives in order to track him down and figure out what he was doing with her photos. The personal goal for this comic will be for Natalie to eventually find out who Trevor Lockwood is and if it's possible for her to bring him somewhere where she can confront him about abducting her from the nightclub in order to have sex with her against her will. She also wants to make sure that nobody else goes through what she went through at his hands and this is why a lot of subplots will develop over time; there will be another woman abducted by Trevor Lockwood, or another women who gets into a similar dangerous situation as Natalie did (such as a woman walking home late one night when she gets attacked by someone or something). -----------------------------<br><br>Now let's have a look at the structure of what went into creating these story elements:<br><br>As you can see, this is just an example of the type of story outline that I create when plotting out my stories. This is what I like to use and find the most useful when it comes to planning out the details of my stories but there are other types you can use as well; one that is often used by comic creators is listing down some index cards on a board and organizing them according to their chronology and then writing all of their ideas down as they come to you; be sure to include any idea you've had or any subject matter, even if it's something like ""I'm going to describe a car being driven"" or ""I think I'm going to show an animal running out of nowhere."" When doing this, make note of the times where you find yourself becoming stuck in your story and don't know how to continue it; this may mean that there's some missing information and if that's the case, then start working on doing research and coming up with ideas so that you can fill in these gaps by adding more details.<br><br>Go over your outline again and again until you have all the information needed for your story. Then go through your notes once more, deciding how best to present your story. Now that you have all the information, you can write your story in any way possible; just make sure that you know what goes where in order to have the right information included and in order to put forth the best presentation possible. For instance, a comic script can be followed by a prose novel or novella with all of your characters spoken dialogue included in it.<br><br>At this point, you should have a basic storyline for the first part of your story; any details that don't make sense at this point will most likely be ironed out during the next steps of creating your story but be sure to go over everything beforehand so that you don't waste time later when it comes to finalizing anything. I'm going to talk about my experience with other elements now and then give an in-depth look on how I implement these things into my stories when writing them down and people who are interested in trying them can see if they work well for them.<br><br>What is an Outline and Why do You Need One?<br><br>An outline is essentially a guide; it is something that helps keep track of all of the parts that make up your story as well as how they relate to one another. If something doesn't make sense, if you're unsure how something fits into your story or if you're missing a few details, this will help you out immensely. It is something that will present your ideas in a way that makes them easy to follow for anyone who views it, be it another writer or anyone else who is looking at your work. The more detailed your outline is, the better it will be because you can show every little detail that goes into making up the story and doing so will leave less room for mistakes when writing each scene. I usually include everything I want to show in my stories; all of the characters I want, how they interact with one another, what they look like and how they dress but I do not include any dialogue unless it's absolutely necessary because I personally find it very tedious to write dialogue and prefer to focus on my characters' actions instead.<br><br>Keep in mind that this isn't going to be a storyboard; an outline doesn't describe what each scene looks like because a lot of the time, this can change during writing/drawing/animating depending on what makes sense and what's necessary for telling your story properly without running into any issues. For example: If there is too much going on in one scene or too many characters",0
"Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.","? Do you want the story to be sad, or happy? What, exactly, is the story going to be about? What is Jack doing now?<br><br>Sorry, I do understand what you mean by that, but I truly don't think your premise is clear enough for me to write a story based on it. Can you give us more information about what happened? Do you want the story to be sad, or happy? What, exactly, is the story going to be about? What is Jack doing now?<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Jack sighed softly as he knelt down again. It was ironic that even though they thought they'd had a perfect life together, it had been ripped to shreds and left irreparably broken now. ""I love you so much,"" he said again, as if it was a mantra he wanted to repeat over and over just in case she might be able to hear it somehow; ""and I miss you.""<br><br>He glanced around uncomfortably out into the crowds of people that were visiting with their families for a moment after just voicing those strangely intimate feelings aloud to her, but there wasn’t anyone standing nearby at all. There never were when he came here, not even on the days when he would purposely come in the mornings before any of his co-workers could catch him here in order to be alone with her again. He always felt a little embarrassed whenever he visited her, but there wasn’t anyone here to see and he didn’t have much more time left now for talking to her face-to-face.<br><br>Jack sighed again, this time with just a hint of sorrow, as he looked down at his wife’s grave one last time. There was a patch of freshly mown grass on either side of the gravestone to mark the spot where it had been on display during the funeral service. Her rich brown hair had been brushed out straight in all directions from her head, and she had been wearing a dark blue dress when she was laid to rest: just like she would have worn for their wedding day if she hadn’t died so far too soon. “Eliza...I promise you that I will never love any other woman as long as I live,"" Jack whispered softly as he slid his hand into his blazer pocket and grasped the single rose that he had brought there with him all day long. ""I can’t believe how long it’s already been since you were taken from me too soon. It’s been exactly six months to the day.""<br><br>Jack stood up and stepped back from the grave. He wanted to say more, but he couldn’t think of anything else to do or any other way he could possibly say goodbye. There was no point in talking to her any more anymore...and there would never be any answers again. She had told him that she loved him and that she always would right before she died in his arms, but it wasn’t enough anymore. Jack couldn’t go on without her, not after all they had been through together and all that they had meant to each other over the years that they had spent building their life together. He just couldn’t face another day without her. As long as he lived, there would never be anyone else for him; because if Eliza wasn't here with him anymore, then there was no one else he could ever want or love again...<br><br>Jack slid his hand down over the top surface of the rose in his pocket as he turned away from her grave and began walking away from it. He closed his eyes against the tears welling up behind them as he thought about how much worse this day was going to be after he spent the rest of it thinking about it. He couldn’t even go back to work; there would also be no point in seeing anyone besides her today. She had been his life, and now she was gone. It was a truth that he would have to live for the rest of his days with now, and nothing could ever change that fact.<br><br>Jack paused a moment as he walked through the grassy patch of beautiful wildflowers growing on either side of the gravel path leading through them, catching another glimpse of her grave from behind him before continuing his walk out of the cemetery. The bright morning sunlight silhouetted him against her resting place, making it look like a miniature monument built for him alone as he pushed its doors open and stepped out into the busy street beyond with one last look back towards it.<br><br>Today was such a tragic day for him...and there were still five hundred ninety-nine more left after this one... Tags: challenge:*sighs* how is it possible? i've been waiting there so long... something's bound to set me free... -------------------------------------------------------Premise: The funeral is today. It's been six months to the day since Eliza died, and her husband still can't bring himself to accept it. He goes through the motions of living, but he can't see any purpose in it without her. When he's alone, he talks to her. Even now, he can't help but think that she'll answer him back.Current Story Outline: Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.Write a story according to this premise, continuing from the current outline.----------------------------- I miss you so much it hurts... Jack was standing alone at the gravesite where Eliza had been laid to rest before the funeral service started. Her body hadbeen on display during the funeral service. Her rich brown hair had been brushed out straight in all directions from her head, and she had been wearing a dark blue dress when she was laid to rest: just like she would have worn for their wedding day if she hadn’t died so far too soon. “Eliza...I promise you that I will never love any other woman as long as I live,"" Jack whispered softly as he slid his hand into his blazer pocket and grasped the single rose that he had brought there with him all day long.

"Shannon meets Luke, a young man who helps her with her second book.","a little bit too strange for her. Shannon never spoke about such things as jewelry so there was no chance in which she would have come across it somewhere on a random walk in the mall; this was just a little out of her previous reach and Erin could only wonder what had happened in order for Shannon to be so weird about this whole thing.<br><br>""It's nothing important... Really... It's just some necklace that I bought from some store..."" Shannon said as she looked away from Erin, hoping that she would get distracted from the fact that Shannon knew something weird was going on with this whole situation.<br><br>""You don't seem all right... Maybe you should see someone or something..."" Erin suggested though there was no way in which she had met someone who seemed more healthy than Shannon; there were times when she wondered why they were friends at all because they did not have much in common but somehow, their friendship was still alive and well.<br><br>""I'm fine... Please don't make excuses for me just to go see someone because I cannot deal with anything else besides writing..."" Shannon stressed, hoping that Erin would after all respect her wishes and not try to force anything on her just because of the way everything looked like it should be.<br><br>""You always seem to decide what you should do on your own... This is what I'm here for... You know that..."" Erin said as she tried to calm down a bit because she really did not want to fight with Shannon over something that might not even be that important.<br><br>""I know... I just wanted to make sure..."" Shannon said in a bid to assure Erin that her feelings were not hurt by the things she said.<br><br>""Alright... It was just a suggestion..."" Erin said as she made one last attempt at making sure that Shannon was alright, even though deep down inside, she figured out that there must have been something wrong with her which made her behave the way she had been behaving so far. Hearing all this being mentioned, it only meant one thing and it was something which Erin did not really want to accept but there was no other way in which she could think right now, so there was no other viable option left for her but to think of everything going wrong in Shannon's life and how this would be just another reason for her friend to go crazy.<br><br>""I'm fine..."" Shannon stated again as if she wanted nothing more than for everyone around her to believe that things were going great and even if there was something very odd about this whole situation, Shannon did not want anyone to notice. This was not something that she could explain since she had no idea in which direction things were going to develop. If her father had been around, he might have said something but he was not and Shannon would have to make do with her own decisions.<br><br>""I wish I could believe you..."" Erin said in a bid to stress the point that there was still something wrong with the way things were between them and that Shannon was definitely hiding some specific thing from her which if revealed might as well drive Erin crazy as well as it would be able to break the friendship apart.<br><br>""Just drop it..."" Shannon said as if there was no other option left for her but to make sure that Erin would leave things this way and nothing more than that; she had a lot of weight resting on her shoulders, the least of which were Erin's own concerns.<br><br>""Let's just go see some coffee so we can talk a bit before we go home... I really need you today..."" Erin said with a smile on her face; though she knew things were not going all that great, there was nothing better than getting together with your best friend after a long day at work.<br><br>""I guess I could go for some coffee..."" Shannon said, not really sure if she wanted to deal with Erin but it was better than going home to think things over again and again as well as try to find some answers to life's many questions.<br><br>Erin smiled at Shannon, the way she did so many times in the past few months, all of which when she needed her best friend the most; she might have complained about Shannon's attitude towards life, but deep down inside, she knew that this was the only way in which they could do things and that was something which had worked out in their favor.<br><br>""Let's go to see Starbucks or something... I know there are a lot of people there but I cannot be alone right now..."" Erin said as if she wanted nothing more than for Shannon to tell her what exactly was going on with her and even though Erin believed that something had been finally revealed, there was no point trying to pressurize Shannon right now. There were moments when you needed someone and you simply did not want them to leave your side at any given moment because they were your support system.<br><br>""I want a cinnamon roll from Starbucks..."" Shannon said with a smile on her face; there was no way she could just sit there and do nothing when the girl she had loved for so many years was trying to get closer to her.<br><br>""What? A cinnamon roll?"" Erin asked, not really sure if she had heard what Shannon had said or not but even if that was the case, there was no way she would have processed all of it.<br><br>""You heard me..."" Shannon said as she tried to make her way back to her seat and pick up a pen and some paper in order for her to draw a picture of what she wanted.<br><br>""Are you sure that you have been feeling fine... I mean... you did not even talk about anything else but work..."" Erin said as the thoughts which were running through her mind simply refused to let go of them; Shannon's father might very well be dead at this moment and there was nothing they could do about it besides wait.<br><br>""I'm fine... Really..."" Shannon said as if everything was going great and that there was nothing wrong with the fact that Luke might never wake up again in his entire life; he would be just another statistic on the long list of people who had gone before him.<br><br>Erin nodded in response,",0
"Natalie Harper makes a deal with Trevor Lockwood, a man she met online, to meet him in person in exchange for money so that she can pay her rent .","Natalie Harper made small talk with Trevor Lockwood online for several months. She was attracted to his confidence and good looks, even though he was nearly twenty years her senior. She saw herself as a confident woman, but she lacked the courage to approach him in public, nor would she do so out of respect for her boyfriend. So Natalie Harper had turned to the internet, where she found Trevor Lockwood. He was interested in meeting her in person, if she had enough money for their date. Natalie Harper agreed and they set up a time and place to meet. Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what kind of man she would date. Natalie Harper said that she would go out with someone like Trevor Lockwood, although he was not much older than her. Natalie Harper asked Trevor Lockwood if he was married. He said he wasn’t and had no children. She asked him if he lived alone, and again, his answer was positive. Natalie Harper met Trevor Lockwood in a coffee shop on the second floor of a shopping center in East Sacramento. She asked him to meet her there, but she did not tell him why. She gave him the agreed-upon amount of money—five hundred dollars—which he assured her would be enough for their date . Trevor Lockwood then gave Natalie Harper an address in rural Northern California and told her to come there. Natalie Harper was aware of Trevor Lockwood’s offer prior to this meeting, but she just needed to talk with him face-to-face to make sure he really meant her no harm. Natalie Harper got  in her car and drove towards the area where Trevor Lockwood told her he lived. She turned off Interstate 80 and drove on the country roads that led into his neighborhood. The roads were isolated, but she had a small map with the directions that Trevor Lockwood had given her. Natalie Harper arrived at his home after driving for about an hour. It was a large house set on a hill, surrounded by forest land. Natalie Harper parked her car on the side of the road and walked up to the front door of the house. She knocked and was immediately greeted by Trevor Lockwood, who opened it with a key he retrieved from inside.  Natalie Harper stepped into the house and greeted Trevor Lockwood.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was wearing a black short-sleeved shirt underneath a red cardigan sweater. His face was clean-shaven, except for a goatee that was trimmed close to his mouth. He had dark brown hair, short at the sides and about two inches long in the back. His eyes were blue and he gave off a strong and commanding presence to those he met. Trevor Lockwood was twenty-four years old and living with his parents in their five-bedroom house. He worked part-time at a small marketing firm in San Francisco, but his income was not very high. Trevor Lockwood invited Natalie Harper to sit down on the couch in his living room.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper how she liked driving up to his house. She said that she had enjoyed the drive, as it was quiet and peaceful. Trevor Lockwood moved to the edge of the couch and cleared a spot for Natalie Harper. Trevor Lockwood moved closer to Natalie Harper and sat down next to her.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood told Natalie Harper that he really enjoyed talking with her online and that he would have much preferred talking with her in person, but circumstances had prevented him from doing so. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand up to Natalie Harper’s shoulder.<br><br>Natalie Harper reached for Trevor Lockwood’s hand and placed it on her thigh. She looked at his lips and then smiled at him as she moved her head closer to his mouth. Trevor Lockwood moved his head away from her.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper if she had thought of any names for the business venture they were discussing. Trevor Lockwood explained that he had already thought of a name, but he was always willing to listen to suggestions from others. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand slowly up the inside of her thigh and moved it towards her crotch.<br><br>Natalie Harper moved Trevor Lockwood’s hand away. She was surprised that Trevor had touched her so soon in their conversation, as they still had so many details to discuss. She told Trevor Lockwood of two possible names that she wanted to consider, and Trevor Lockwood nodded his head.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked if he could move closer to Natalie Harper on the couch. Natalie Harper agreed and Trevor Lockwood moved next to her on the couch.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what she wanted him to do",1
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.",". “You are not a bad girl!” he barked in an excited voice.<br><br>Then the little dog suddenly stopped wagging his tail and looked at Kitty very seriously. He stared at her for a moment, then said “I don’t understand why somebody would yell at you for being a bad girl when you’re not—can I help you? Can I be of any assistance to you in any way?”<br><br>Kitty did not know what to say. She began staring at the ground, not sure what to do next.<br><br>Lulu Laverne stared at Kitty for a long moment. Then he nodded his head and smiled again. “I see that you have a problem,” he said in an understanding voice. “In fact, I think I can help you solve it!”<br><br>Kitty stared at the little dog. He was so kind and friendly that she almost forgot about the other men shouting at her.<br><br>“What is your name?” Kitty finally asked, still staring at the ground.<br><br>Lulu Laverne’s tail started wagging again, and his little ears perked up. “My name is Lulu Laverne,” he said in a friendly voice. Kitty looked up at him and smiled. It was nice to see that a dog could be so friendly, especially when some people were being so cruel to her. “And what is your name?”<br><br>Kitty hesitated a moment before answering. She still did not know if Sergei was still watching her and listening, but she realized that the kind little dog seemed to genuinely care about her. She began looking up at him again and said, “My name is Kitty Pawsky. I’m a private detective who moved here from the city because I like country life. But now there are some big problems here in the park, and I think it would be good if we all worked together on it. Do you think we can do that?”<br><br>Lulu Laverne stopped moving for a moment, and his happy face slowly began to turn a little more serious. “I see you moving your tail,” Kitty said gently. “Is there something wrong? Do you not want to talk about it?” <br><br>Lulu Laverne turned his head away from her. “It’s okay,” he muttered in a quiet voice. “I just have one friend here in the park who likes to tease me sometimes. He leaves catnip mice and feathers all over my house so that I’ll get into trouble when the other dogs see them. Sometimes he even comes inside on of the houses and scares me while I’m sleeping, but then he always leaves a treat for me by my bed, so it’s okay.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “So your friend is the one who does these bad things?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne shook his head. “No, he doesn’t do it! He just likes to watch me get into trouble.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “Then it sounds like he’s the one who is doing these bad things, since you keep getting into trouble,” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne sighed. “I told him to stop a long time ago, but he won’t listen,” he said. “And now I have to go in this house and do my homework…”<br><br>Kitty frowned. She knew that this was a bad thing that this friend was doing to Lulu Laverne, but she wasn’t exactly sure how to help him.<br><br>“Why doesn’t your friend listen to you?” she asked.<br><br>Lulu Laverne sighed again and shook his head. “I don’t know, he just doesn’t like to be told what to do, I guess.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “But you are his friend, and he must care about you a lot, right?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne smiled. “Yeah, he does care about me a lot,” he said. “You know, I’m starting to think that maybe I’ll just go into the house and tell my parents about it so they can help me.”<br><br>Kitty smiled as well. “That sounds like a good idea,” she said. Then, after a moment, she continued . “Do your homework first though, okay?”<br><br>Lulu Laverne laughed. “All right, I’ll do that first!” he said. He started walking off through the park as Kitty called after him.<br><br>“Lulu, stay safe, okay?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne stopped and turned around to look at her. She smiled again. “I will, Kitty, I will!” he said. He continued walking towards his house as Kitty watched him go. She turned her gaze back to the park.<br><br>She saw that Sergei was heading for the swing set. The dogs were looking at him as he approached them. Kitty didn’t understand it, but she was glad that the dogs had someone to play with besides just each other and her; it’s much better when there are more people around to make everything a little more fun.<br><br>Kitty moved towards the swing set, ready to go off on another adventure into the dog park and try to figure out what was going on. She had followed Sergei to where he always seemed to go, and now she would work her way through the park and see what sort of clues she could discover.<br><br>There was something going on here, Kitty was sure of it. She moved closer to the swing set. The park was quiet. Nothing moved except for the trees and the leaves on them. Kitty moved towards the slide near the swings and moved in a position where she could see both of the swings.<br><br>She was moving closer to the swing set when she saw it – a catnip mouse. On the ground next to one of the swings sat a fluffy little gray catnip mouse with black ears and green eyes. It was moving from side to side as if trying to get the attention of the dogs at the park. Kitty moved over to where that was, and then reached out and picked up the toy.<br><br>She moved over to where she had last seen Sergei, moving slowly and carefully so that she didn’t step in anything in the park. She moved carefully, because there was a lot of stuff on the ground in the park. There were food scraps, leaves, pine cones and other stuff on the ground all over the place. She moved carefully so that she wouldn’t step in any of this stuff. She could see where some of it came  from – a lot of it had fallen from the trees overhanging the park. But some of it was just there for no reason.<br><br>As she moved ahead, she saw that Sergei wasn’t at the swing set anymore. He was near the slide, just moving back and forth like he had been before. He was looking at her as she walked towards him.<br><br>“You’re coming to play with me, aren’t you?” said Sergei while wagging his tail at Kitty. “You found my mouse! Now we can chase each other around – it will be so much fun!”<br><br>Kitty stared at him, not sure what to say. She didn’t know why he had this mouse with him, or where he was keeping the rest of them. And then she thought about what he had said about killing the dogs. She didn’t want to be around him if he was going to kill more dogs. She backed away from him, and then ran back towards the entrance of the park.<br><br>Sergei started chasing after her again, but this time Kitty didn’t stop. She just kept running until she could get out of the park – she didn’t know if the other dogs were here because they wanted to play, or if they thought the same thing she did. But she couldn’t stay and find out.<br><br>As soon as Kitty was out of the park, she saw that Jose Cuervo was nearby to her, and called out to him.<br><br>“Hey, Jose Cuervo! I need your help!”<br><br>She waited for him to come over and talk to her, but he just ran past her, and then she saw him enter the park. She started walking towards the entrance again, but didn’t go in – there were two other dogs there, and she wasn’t sure if they wanted to play with the other dogs or not.<br><br>“Hey, hey! Stay there! What’s your problem? Come back here so we can talk.”<br><br>Kitty walked towards where the two dogs were. When she got close enough, she shouted, “What’s going on here? Why are all of you in the park – did you get lost or something? I thought this was a place for dogs to come and play, not for them to",1

The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"After that, I just need you to focus on getting better now.”<br><br>Lisa stood up at this point and walked into the other room to collect Daisy’s notebook. She returned to her chair and opened up the notebook. The first few pages were dedicated to instructions on how their family was going to take care of things while she was away, and the last few pages contained some words of wisdom that she wanted her children to read after they got over the initial shock of her passing.<br><br>Just before she started reading, Lisa stopped and held the notebook up for a moment, considering her words. “You know, maybe I shouldn’t read this part of the notebook to them.”<br><br>“Oh? Why not?”<br><br>“It might be too much to handle at one time. It might be too much for them to process all at once.”<br><br>Lisa stopped to consider that point for a moment, then looked up at Daisy. “Can I just tell them some things right now, and read the rest of the words later?”<br><br>“Of course. Whatever you think is best for your children. But there are some things that I have written down that I would like them to hear before I pass on.”<br><br>Lisa nodded her head and settled back into her chair. “Okay, well first, they should know that you wrote about how proud you were of them. Both the way they have dealt with this so far, and the way they have taken care of everything at home while I’m at the hospital with you. You talked a lot about how much confidence you had in them to do the job, even when I wasn’t here. You said that you thought Lisa was ready to handle almost everything, and that she was ready to take over the business if she ever had to. And you were also very proud of both of them for all their hard work in school. You said that you had a good feeling about the direction they were headed.” Lisa paused at this point, but she could see in Daisy’s eyes that she was still fully awake and listening. “I’m not sure when they should know about the other parts, though,” she continued. “You talked about some important things that will affect them when I’m gone. There were things that we need to talk about as a family. ”<br><br>At this point, Daisy’s eyelids began to flutter a little bit and she gasped for air. Lisa looked over at the nurse at the desk and made some hand gestures, which got her attention. The nurse came over and checked Daisy’s vital signs before looking back at Lisa and nodding. “It’s probably just a side effect from these injections,” she explained. “She might need some oxygen for a few minutes, but she should be fine. Give her a second to rest and then try to talk again.”<br><br>Lisa nodded and put the side of her hand on Daisy’s forehead to check her temperature. “I should have brought your hat,” she said as she thought about what else might be troubling Daisy.<br><br>“Is it going to be all right?” Daisy asked in a groggy voice. “Are you going to be there when everything happens?”<br><br>Lisa tried to speak through her own nervousness. “Of course I will be there,” she assured Daisy and then moved closer to listen as the nurse explained what was happening. “I think you might be getting a little bit of a fever,” she said as she took Daisy’s pulse. “They just need to give you some oxygen and we should be on our way again soon. You have been such a trooper,” the nurse continued before turning to Lisa and adding, “You’ve been doing a terrific job of taking care of her. She’s got a great family. I know she will be fine.”<br><br>Lisa tried to control her breathing and nodded in response. “As soon as they give you the okay, I’ll go sit with my mom in the waiting room. She’s already told me all the things she wanted me to know if something happened,” she said before the nurse could interrupt.<br><br>Daisy opened her eyes and slowly turned her head toward Lisa. “Thank you for being there for all of us today,” she said. “I know it hasn’t been easy for you, but if there is any way I can repay you someday, just let me know.”<br><br>Lisa reached out a hand and brought it to her lips in response. “I don’t want to talk  about that just yet. I just want to get through today and see how things look in the morning. After we talk to the doctor tomorrow, I’ll have a better idea of what we need to do after you leave here.”<br><br>When Lisa turned back toward Daisy, her eyes were filled with tears. The nurse stepped up beside them and wiped her hand on a tissue before reaching out to touch Daisy’s arm.<br><br>“Mrs. Mayberry, I think your daughter is worn out and needs to go home for a little while before coming back this evening. She has been such a help today and really been an inspiration to many of the other patients. I know she is a special person, but her strength today has been so uplifting to everyone here.”<br><br>Daisy nodded in agreement as the nurse spoke. “I think she should go home too. She gets up early every day, comes to take care of me, and then gets back here before dark to do whatever I need her to do. If you don’t mind, I would like her to stay here with me tonight. I want us to talk for a while before she goes home.”<br><br>Lisa glanced over at her and smiled weakly, but it was obvious that the emotional strain from the day was now starting to show. As they stood up and started walking toward the door, Lisa reached out and squeezed her mom’s hand. “I know you are tired, but I’m glad you are staying here tonight. I really want to talk about this afternoon and what happened in my office.”<br><br>“Me too,” Daisy said as she squeezed her hand back. “I think you should get some rest though because I want to tell you all about it while it is still fresh in my mind.”<br><br>They both smiled at one another as they walked out of the room and started down the hall toward Lisa’s office. There was a sudden explosion of activity around them as nurses and doctors scurried to and fro with charts, medicine carts, equipment, and other assorted paraphernalia. However, the commotion abruptly ended as they entered the hallway and walked by without a glance at them.<br><br>In the quiet of the hallway, they made their way down to Lisa’s office and took seats across from each other on her sofa. “Okay,  tell me everything you know about this trial,” Lisa said as she picked up her laptop and began turning it on.<br><br>Daisy sighed heavily as she sat back in the love seat and pulled her feet up underneath her. She pulled both hands through her hair in frustration, and then started talking. “I really don’t know much about it except that the doctor said it is an experimental treatment for people with the particular type of lung cancer I have. He told me that he was sending me to Memorial Hospital in St. Louis for an evaluation before I could be enrolled in the trial. He said he had been contacted by a research committee at the hospital and that they would meet me and evaluate me. I’m supposed to leave tomorrow at noon,” she said as she leaned back and covered her eyes with her hand.<br><br>Lisa sat behind her desk and folded her hands in front of her. “That’s great news! It will be such a relief to have you out of the house and somewhere where I can drop by whenever I need to. You’ve become too difficult to deal with lately,” she said. She quickly added, “I don’t mean that as an insult.”<br><br>Daisy looked at Lisa and smiled. “I know you didn’t mean it as an insult. I have been difficult to deal with lately, but maybe now that I am leaving for a while it will give you some rest and you won’t feel so overwhelmed. Maybe it will also relieve Bill of some of the stress he’s been under,” she said. They both sat silently for a moment before Daisy continued, “I think this could be the answer to our problems. I could come through this and we wouldn’t have to worry so much about where the money is going to come from. We could be financially secure again. And, as we used to say in school…it will be like having found the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.”<br><br>“I agree,” said Lisa. She then added, “But what about me? How do I know that you’re going to come through this and be fine? What if it doesn’t work out and you die anyway? How can I go on living without you? You’re all I have. Who is going to take care of me",1
Paula meets Sally in college and the two become best friends.,"<br><br>Paula gripped the steering wheel of her Mustang tightly. She pulled into the parking lot of the quaint little bookstore. As she walked up to the front door, she glanced at her watch, knowing exactly what time she was supposed to be there. She didn't want to be late, but she didn't want to be early either. She took a deep breath and walked in, glancing around quickly before spotting Sally.<br><br>""Hey you,"" Sally said with a smile as Paula approached her at one of the tables in the back of the store. ""I didn't know if you were going to make it today.""<br><br>""I wouldn't miss it,"" Paula said, sliding into a chair across from Sally and smiling as she pulled out a notepad and pen from her purse. ""It's too important.""<br><br>""I know,"" Sally said, reaching across the table and squeezing Paula's hand briefly before letting go. ""I can't believe we've been doing this for 5 years now.""<br><br>Paula thought about it for a moment, then smiled slightly and nodded. ""Yeah,"" she said quietly as Sally glanced around at their surroundings nervously before starting their meeting.<br><br>Sally's eyes were sad as she turned back to Paula. ""I think we should do something different today,"" she said quietly. Paula's eyes widened in surprise.<br><br>""What do you mean?"" she asked, lowering her voice as well as she tried to keep herself composed.<br><br>""I think we should tell them,"" Sally said quietly, emphasizing the last word heavily as they both glanced around nervously.<br><br>Paula sighed and looked down at her hands, feeling her heart start to race before composing herself again and locking eyes with Sally. ""I... I don't know,"" she said, shaking her head slowly and subconsciously rubbing her left ring finger with her right hand.<br><br>""No... I'm tired of hiding this,"" Sally said, leaning forward across the table towards Paula and looking into her eyes intensely as she spoke. ""We've been lying to them for 5 years now."" The pair paused for a moment before Sally continued. ""Look... I knew that coming here today was going to be tough,"" she said softly, reaching for Paula's hand and clasping it tightly in hers before speaking again. ""There are times when I feel like I can't breathe without you but...""<br><br>Paula could hear someone approaching from behind them so the two of them stopped talking and turned around. Paula took a deep breath and turned back to Sally, trying to keep her voice calm. ""Maybe we can take this one step at a time,"" she said, squeezing Sally's hand to reassure her before the two of them looked back down at their notepads.<br><br>""Okay,"" Sally said softly, turning back to Paula and nodding. ""How about we start with your side of things first?"" she asked as they both started writing out their story ideas.<br><br>Paula nodded in agreement before looking up at Sally and smiling slightly. ""I think I'm ready,"" she said confidently as she put her pen down and closed her notepad, preparing herself for what was next.<br><br>""Okay,"" Sally said very seriously, pushing the stack of cards that were already filled out towards Paula before standing up and clearing her throat, preparing to tell her story that she had written out on little cards beforehand. ""My name is... Sally.""<br><br>Sally's voice broke as she said that last line so Paula quickly looked over at her and reached across the table for Sally's trembling hand as the two best friends made eye contact with each other for a brief moment before turning their heads quickly away from each other and trying to look anywhere but at each other.<br><br>""My name is... Sally,"" Sally said again, this time sounding a little stronger as she spoke, but her voice still trembled slightly as she spoke the words that she had practiced saying for so long. ""I'm a teacher. I have been teaching for 15 years now. My husband's name... is Douglas.""<br><br>Sally took a deep breath before continuing. ""We've been married for 5 years now,"" she said nervously, pausing for a moment before continuing with her story as Paula scribbled down what she was saying.<br><br>""For 6 months of those five years... I've also been in love with another man,"" Sally said quietly, ignoring Paula's sudden intake of breath next to her and looking into Paula's eyes without wavering before continuing. ""His name is Mark...""<br><br>Paula shook her head slowly and felt tears well up in her eyes as Sally spoke those words to her. She glanced over at the table where the other members were sitting and could see them looking over at them curiously, but she didn't look away from Sally until after Sally had finished speaking every word that she had written on the little cards beforehand. After that, they both turned away from each other and allowed their tears to flow freely.<br><br>""I love you, Sal,"" Paula said, looking at Sally and smiling nervously as she tried to comfort her best friend. ""I'll always be here for you.""<br><br>Sally nodded slowly before taking a deep breath and looking into Paula's eyes again for the first time since she started telling her story about Mark. ""Thank you..."" she said softly, tears still flowing down her cheeks too heavily for her to speak normally.<br><br>Paula smiled slightly and nodded in response before getting up from her seat across the table from Sally and walking over to the lives they had written on little cards that they were using as inspiration for their stories.

""You could get in a lot of trouble if she does end up...""<br><br>""I'll go back to the apartment,"" said the woman, cutting Aimee off before she could finish her sentence. ""But I don't think I can stay there alone right now..."" Her voice sounded almost distant, as if she were thinking about something else instead of paying attention to what Aimee was saying.<br><br>""I'll find a hotel room,"" said the man quickly. ""If my wife stays with me then I can't leave her alone and I'm not going to stay in a hotel room without her when she needs me..."" The sirens grew louder and louder as they pulled up behind Aimee, who was still watching the two of them silently.<br><br>""You're on your way home anyway,"" said Aimee finally, talking over the sound of the sirens that were getting closer. ""So you should just go back together."" She turned around and took a few big steps away from them so that they would be able to hear each other over the sirens, then glanced over her shoulder one last time before starting to walk faster. They shouldn't have to be separated; it wasn't fair for either one of them.<br><br>""You know,"" said the man suddenly, sounding surprisingly amused. ""I think you're a good girl, Aimee..."" He was walking away from his wife now, so Aimee didn't even have the opportunity to respond to his comment before hearing the woman say that she agreed with that statement as well. They were talking about her but she didn't even know their names or what they did or anything else about them... How could they have possibly known it was impossible for them to be separated...? It was clear that they wanted each other's company; it shouldn't have been possible for them to be separated no matter what happened. They shouldn't have been separated in the first place!<br><br>""..."" Aimee turned around and watched as the two of them waved one last time before disappearing around a corner, then sighed sadly and shook her head. ""Good girl,"" she muttered to herself with a small smile, thinking about how meaningful those words were coming from someone who didn't know her at all. ""Maybe I really am..."" She shook her head again and started walking forward towards her apartment again; there wasn't any point in staying out here when she had so much work left to do today!<br><br>As soon as the young woman finally got home and settled down, she could hear the sound of another siren in the distance. It was a little bit quieter than the last one and seemed to be coming from within a couple blocks of her apartment; it was probably just fire trucks stopping at some building for some reason or another. Aimee didn't really care what they were doing, though; she had already started working on her next post, so she just turned up her music even louder and continued writing.<br><br>She couldn't wait to go to sleep tonight; it had been a long day! Once she finished up with this post, she would have exactly one hundred articles published! Once that happened, she would probably feel really good about herself for a while... Aimee smiled happily at the thought of that, then started typing quickly again. She would have a lot of work ahead of her if she wanted to hit one hundred individual posts by tomorrow evening... But that didn't matter because this was her dream and Aimee knew that everything else was going to fall into place eventually! She was going to be successful in whatever career path or life path she chose for herself; there were no doubts about that at all.<br><br>A/N: I'm pretty sure I just made up the name of this imaginary band, haha.<br><br>“But really, I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. Should I go to school and get a degree in something?” Lola asked as they dragged themselves through another day of work. “I mean…I’m twenty-one and I have no idea what I want to do with my life… What do you think?”<br><br>Her best friend, who was currently eating his lunch at his desk even though it was only afternoon, gave her a sarcastic look that clearly said “You don’t care about this at all so why are you asking me?” “Do whatever makes you happy, Lola. That should be your only concern. If you love what you do then it doesn’t matter how much money you make or if it only gets you by…you need to be happy doing what it is that makes you happy. That’s all that matters to me,” he replied solemnly between bites of food.<br><br>Lola nodded before turning back towards her computer and the blank word processing document she had opened up not even an hour ago; she didn't know if she should go back to the beginning or try and continue where she had left off before.<br><br>“I just don’t know if I can do this anymore. I can’t find a real meaning in anything I do anymore…” Lola said quietly as she stared into the computer screen. “I think it might be time for me to start thinking about going back to school for nursing… It’s an idea, anyways… Well, that was a close one! It was almost midnight but you made it, everyone! Today starts my new series on what it means to be successful in the world of online writing. This series is going to have a lot of lessons in it, some of them coming from personal experience and many others coming from research that I have done...but not without some help from my followers here on ! Today we are going to talk about what success tastes like; so let's get right into it!Today's article is all about knowing what you want out of life and establishing goals for yourself before you even think about trying to make money doing something you love...or as someone told me once--not loving what you do but doing something you love.

The world ends in a cataclysmic event.,"One day, the world just ended.<br><br>    The sky turned red and the ground shook. Everyone knew it was the end for all of them. The lights went out, the electricity left, along with the running water and all other necessities that people took for granted. The world ended.<br><br>And then it started again. A flash of green light and a brilliant white sound filled the sky as if the world was being zapped clean. And then it happened again. And again.<br><br>And suddenly, everything was ok again in the world, but darker than before. Some said that heaven came to earth and wiped the world clean, and that everything would be fine from now on. But that didn’t really explain why there was so much darkness afterwards. Why it seemed darker than before. Why the world seemed smaller somehow, like a smaller version of itself. Why people kept seeing ghosts everywhere and zombies, and demons and all kinds of creatures that should have died in the cataclysm that had just happened.<br><br>The world was ending again, but this time for real. The blackness in the world was spreading. Soon everything would be gone forever. The end of the world had come for real this time .<br><br>The sun gave way to the blackness, and in the middle of it all, was a huge ring of light that shone brightly from all over the earth. It came out of nowhere, and there was no explanation for it whatsoever. But everyone knew what it was. And they knew it meant the end of the world was finally here.<br><br>As the sky got darker, and then darker still, and the ring of light turned into a circle of light that seemed to emanate from the ground beneath them, darkness finally fell over everything. All of nature went silent. The birds stopped singing, grass stopped growing, flowers stopped blooming, trees stopped leafing. Rivers and streams dried up.<br><br>And then the sky turned red.<br><br>The whole sky turned red, like the color of blood. And the ground shook violently beneath them as all of nature was overcome with a terrible heat that seemed to come from below their feet.  So people ran away in terror, everyone trying to get as far away from each other as possible. Everyone ran for their own lives as fast as they possibly could, not knowing what would happen next, nor where they would run to. They just knew they had to get away from others as fast as possible before the end came upon them.<br><br>The people were in such a terrible state of panic and confusion, that when Maria Martinez tried to ask the others what was going on, no one paid any attention to her. All they could think of was getting away from everyone else and somewhere safe, and so they all ignored her. Maria  ran around in circles for a while trying to figure out what was happening and where to go, but it was hopeless.<br><br>“I don’t know what to do! What should I do?” she cried out desperately into the night air as she ran around in circles on the plaza. The sun disappeared behind a wall of flames that burned its way across the horizon like a fiery river and plunged the world into darkness. It was now pitch black and eerie shadows danced all around as if some otherworldly creatures were playing tricks on them.<br><br>Maria felt so frightened that she was shaking uncontrollably, but she  didn’t have much time to think, because the ground started to crumble and buildings collapsed as the earth shook violently beneath their feet. Everyone began screaming and trying to run away as fast as they could, not knowing what was causing this, or where to go.  Maria could hear the sound of glass breaking and the distant, terrified screams of her neighbors as she ran through the streets just like everyone else.<br><br>Maria looked up at the night sky and saw a bright light shining down from it. It spread its beams out across the landscape like a million tiny spotlights, illuminating everything in sight. Everything looked different now, as if it was lit up by some weird light that didn’t belong there. Suddenly, the sky went dark again and it seemed as if a hole had opened in the Earth from which they could see far below them. The moon disappeared and the stars vanished from the sky, plunging the world into darkness. Then the ground fractured and an enormous crack spread from horizon to horizon, swallowing up everything in its path.<br><br>The sky faded to red as fire engulfed the world. Finally, the light faded and everything went silent once more. Then a blinding flash of white fire burst forth, engulfing the sky.<br><br>The ground crumbled and opened up, swallowing up not only the sky but everything in sight. Trees, buildings, cars; all disappeared like dust in a rainstorm. Everything except for one lone building which stood unharmed at the center of all this chaos; untouched by the chaos  that engulfed everything else.<br><br>Cars and bodies flew through the air like dust in the wind.

Then, with a loud crash and a thunderous roar, everything stopped. The land fell silent again, as if nothing had ever happened at all.

"With supplies running low and tensions high, the group must work together to find a way out before it's too late.","was no way they were going to miss out on their last meal together.<br><br>The sounds of their laughter and voices echoed throughout the old house as they talked about all the things that had happened since they'd found themselves in there; some of them were reminiscing about funny things that happened in the past while the others just told stories that had happened after they'd found themselves holed up in there. He laughed with them and even smiled along, he really did enjoy hearing some of their funny stories and it felt good to have a nice time with everyone, even if it was only for a little while longer. The night went on and before he knew it, one by one everyone began to fall asleep but he wasn't tired at all. That thing was still roaming around outside and he knew for certain now that it wasn't going to stop until it got what it wanted; to take over this place and kill them all. Ever so slowly he sneaked out from his bed and crept towards the door leading out of their room, knowing full well his sister wouldn't want him walking around at night when she was sleeping so close by; she didn't need to know that he was just about to go upstairs though.<br><br>He opened the door carefully and peeked outside; all he had to do was quietly walk to the kitchen and open the pantry door to his right, where they'd been storing some of the food they'd found. He closed the door and slowly made his way through the hallway when suddenly he heard a sound coming from inside one of the other rooms. He could easily tell that that thing was inside there and it didn't take long for him to realize that it was waiting for him...waiting for him to make a move so it could get a clear shot at his sister and everyone else.<br><br>He looked around, looking for anything that might be able to help him in some way but there wasn't much left in this house; all he could see were things he'd seen before without any purpose other than being decoration for the place. That's when an idea started forming inside his head, something small but it was all he had at that moment. If only he could get past this thing without waking up everyone else then maybe...maybe he'd have a chance at getting them out of there before morning came around.<br><br>It took every ounce of strength he had left in him but he managed to stay quiet while sneaking past where the thing was hiding inside one of the rooms nearby; as soon as he'd gotten past it, he ran towards the stairs without looking back. He took them two by two as he headed for the kitchen, trying his best to stay as quiet as possible. As soon as he reached the kitchen, he turned around and looked out through the wooden boards that had long ago been put up over the windows; sure enough there was that thing, still standing outside staring at something on the ground, probably waiting for him to make a move into one of the rooms nearby. He tried his best to breathe in and out calmly, wasting time but not complaining about it; all that mattered now was getting away from this place with his sister and everyone else before it was too late.<br><br>""Are you alright?""<br><br>He suddenly heard someone calling out to him and quickly turned around to look at who it was. His mother came walking towards him with a concerned look on her face; she had also been getting more and more worried as they hadn't seen or heard from him in quite some time now.<br><br>""I'm fine mom...I'm just tired,"" he told her with a smile on his face, knowing full well how important this little show of theirs really was ""I just wanted some...some water,"" he told her, acting like he was trying to find something to drink inside the kitchen.<br><br>""Oh...well, I'll get you some in a little bit. Why don't you go back to bed now?"" she asked him and he simply nodded in agreement; sure enough this little show was enough of an excuse for them to both stop doing what they were doing and go back to bed. That thing still wouldn't try anything while there were so many people around and it wouldn't do anything as long as he stayed close to the house either.<br><br>His mother turned around and slowly walked towards the door leading back into their room when suddenly that thing outside moved closer towards the window; despite being hidden by the wooden boards, it didn't take long before it saw him standing right in front of it. Ever so slowly its arm reached out towards the window and ripped down one of the boards; despite being outside, it managed to see his face clearly with its glowing eyes. It stared right at him for a few moments before disappearing into the darkness; this was his chance! As soon as that thing turned around, he ran inside their room through the backdoor leading to his sister's room where they'd been sleeping with everyone else. The thing followed him inside but just when he thought it was finally within his grasp, it disappeared with a loud bang which shook the whole house.<br><br>""What was that?"" he heard his mother ask in a nervous tone and immediately knew this thing had done something to scare them off before it could do anything to them. It scared the living hell out of him for a moment but he couldn't let that stop him from getting everyone out of there; that thing wasn't going to try anything while everyone was awake so as soon as most of them were back in their rooms, he went from one room to another and gathered up all the stuff they had with them before coming back into the main room where everyone was waiting for him. Thankfully no one even asked what he was doing until he had everything ready for their little escape.<br><br>""What are you doing?"" she asked but stopped after seeing him pointing at something behind her; she turned around only to see that thing standing just outside the bedroom door with its arm stretched out towards him. She tried calling out to him but there was nothing she could do: her fear got the better of her and she quickly ran away from its arm, taking everyone else with her as they continued moving towards the stairs.<br><br>""The car...""<br><br>",0
Paula meets Sally in college and the two become best friends.,"<br><br>Paula gripped the steering wheel of her Mustang tightly. She pulled into the parking lot of the quaint little bookstore. As she walked up to the front door, she glanced at her watch, knowing exactly what time she was supposed to be there. She didn't want to be late, but she didn't want to be early either. She took a deep breath and walked in, glancing around quickly before spotting Sally.<br><br>""Hey you,"" Sally said with a smile as Paula approached her at one of the tables in the back of the store. ""I didn't know if you were going to make it today.""<br><br>""I wouldn't miss it,"" Paula said, sliding into a chair across from Sally and smiling as she pulled out a notepad and pen from her purse. ""It's too important.""<br><br>""I know,"" Sally said, reaching across the table and squeezing Paula's hand briefly before letting go. ""I can't believe we've been doing this for 5 years now.""<br><br>Paula thought about it for a moment, then smiled slightly and nodded. ""Yeah,"" she said quietly as Sally glanced around at their surroundings nervously before starting their meeting.<br><br>Sally's eyes were sad as she turned back to Paula. ""I think we should do something different today,"" she said quietly. Paula's eyes widened in surprise.<br><br>""What do you mean?"" she asked, lowering her voice as well as she tried to keep herself composed.<br><br>""I think we should tell them,"" Sally said quietly, emphasizing the last word heavily as they both glanced around nervously.<br><br>Paula sighed and looked down at her hands, feeling her heart start to race before composing herself again and locking eyes with Sally. ""I... I don't know,"" she said, shaking her head slowly and subconsciously rubbing her left ring finger with her right hand.<br><br>""No... I'm tired of hiding this,"" Sally said, leaning forward across the table towards Paula and looking into her eyes intensely as she spoke. ""We've been lying to them for 5 years now."" The pair paused for a moment before Sally continued. ""Look... I knew that coming here today was going to be tough,"" she said softly, reaching for Paula's hand and clasping it tightly in hers before speaking again. ""There are times when I feel like I can't breathe without you but...""<br><br>Paula could hear someone approaching from behind them so the two of them stopped talking and turned around. Paula took a deep breath and turned back to Sally, trying to keep her voice calm. ""Maybe we can take this one step at a time,"" she said, squeezing Sally's hand to reassure her before the two of them looked back down at their notepads.<br><br>""Okay,"" Sally said softly, turning back to Paula and nodding. ""How about we start with your side of things first?"" she asked as they both started writing out their story ideas.<br><br>Paula nodded in agreement before looking up at Sally and smiling slightly. ""I think I'm ready,"" she said confidently as she put her pen down and closed her notepad, preparing herself for what was next.<br><br>""Okay,"" Sally said very seriously, pushing the stack of cards that were already filled out towards Paula before standing up and clearing her throat, preparing to tell her story that she had written out on little cards beforehand. ""My name is... Sally.""<br><br>Sally's voice broke as she said that last line so Paula quickly looked over at her and reached across the table for Sally's trembling hand as the two best friends made eye contact with each other for a brief moment before turning their heads quickly away from each other and trying to look anywhere but at each other.<br><br>""My name is... Sally,"" Sally said again, this time sounding a little stronger as she spoke, but her voice still trembled slightly as she spoke the words that she had practiced saying for so long. ""I'm a teacher. I have been teaching for 15 years now. My husband's name... is Douglas.""<br><br>Sally took a deep breath before continuing. ""We've been married for 5 years now,"" she said nervously, pausing for a moment before continuing with her story as Paula scribbled down what she was saying.<br><br>""For 6 months of those five years... I've also been in love with another man,"" Sally said quietly, ignoring Paula's sudden intake of breath next to her and looking into Paula's eyes without wavering before continuing. ""His name is Mark...""<br><br>Paula shook her head slowly and felt tears well up in her eyes as Sally spoke those words to her. She glanced over at the table where the other members were sitting and could see them looking over at them curiously, but she didn't look away from Sally until after Sally had finished speaking every word that she had written on the little cards beforehand. After that, they both turned away from each other and allowed their tears to flow freely.<br><br>""I love you, Sal,"" Paula said, looking at Sally and smiling nervously as she tried to comfort her best friend. ""I'll always be here for you.""<br><br>Sally nodded slowly before taking a deep breath and looking into Paula's eyes again for the first time since she started telling her story about Mark. ""Thank you..."" she said softly, tears still flowing down her cheeks too heavily for her to speak normally.<br><br>Paula smiled slightly and nodded in response before getting up from her seat across the table from Sally and walking over to the lives they had written on little cards that they were using as inspiration for their stories. She placed one card in front of each member with a title written on it before turning back to Sally, who's hand was still shaking as she held onto Paula's right hand tightly with both of hers.<br><br>""Thanks everyone,"" Paula said softly, smiling weakly at everyone around them as the three remaining members of Trembling Pencils wrote out their next stories while Paula spoke.<br><br>Chapter 3: How They Feel About Each Other<br><br>""I'm ready,"" Sally announced quietly as soon as",0
"When Jack is alone, he talks to her.","laid in bed, holding each other, crying for a long time. Eventually they fell asleep and Jack woke up after a couple of hours – he didn’t even realize that he had fallen asleep – to find her lying next to him, sound asleep. He lay there watching her sleep for a while before getting up to go to the bathroom. As he was walking back, she opened her eyes and looked up at him.<br><br>“Jack? Are you okay?”<br><br>He came back closer to the bed and answered, “I’m fine. I just had something important to tell you. Can we talk?”<br><br>“Of course. Go ahead.”<br><br>“Eliza, remember that day last summer when we got each other flowers and went out on our first date? Remember how much fun we had? Remember how happy we were?” Jack continued.<br><br>“Of course. You told me about it every day since then too.” she said with a smile on her face. “Tell me about today then.”<br><br>Jack paused for a moment and thought about it. “Today I felt the same way as I did day. Except today, the flowers weren’t because of you. They were from my new boss to tell me about my new job tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning, I start working again after six months off to take care of you. That job is the reason why I haven’t gone completely insane yet.” Jack said this last part with a sigh and then thought about it again. “I don’t know, maybe my days just feel so long because we haven’t properly celebrated my birthday yet. Maybe we should do that tomorrow night?” he asked her. “Just us two? I promise I’ll tell you about my new job then too.”<br><br>Jack smiled. “That sounds like fun. Let’s do it then; just you and me, okay?”<br><br>Jack nodded and she smiled again, this time bigger than before. Jack told her about his day and he told her about the latest news. He told her about everything from his new boss to Donald Trump and then back to his new job again. He talked about everything he did that day and all of the things that he didn’t do too. He talked about everything that happened  in his house, from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to bed. He told her about his dreams and his hopes and how he only got an hour of sleep last night because he just couldn’t stop thinking about her.<br><br>Halfway through, Eliza stopped listening. Her smile had disappeared and her face had dropped into her hands again. Jack stopped talking but continued to smile at her. He continued to look at the living room wall and he could tell that she didn’t hear him anymore. Jack knew she didn’t want to hear him say everything that he was saying, but he did anyway. He kept talking because he thought it would help, but now it was making things worse.<br><br>Jack watched her face as tears trickled down her cheeks and he could hear her sobbing. The living room door opened and closed softly as Eliza walked away from him, into the kitchen. Jack sat on the living room couch and watched her try to wipe her face with one hand while holding a wine glass with the other.<br><br>“Eliza?” Jack asked her. She didn’t answer him, but moved to the refrigerator and opened it.<br><br>“Did you go to the store?” she said to no one.<br><br>Jack moved toward her slowly, his legs weak. His eyes were filling with tears again now that he saw her crying. He didn’t want her to cry alone and he wanted to say everything that he thought might make her feel better, but he moved slowly because he was unsure if she wanted to hear it.<br><br>“I know you don’t want to hear me talk about it,” Jack said to her. He moved closer and stood behind her as she leaned against the fridge door.<br><br>“But I can’t stop,” he continued. “Every time I open my mouth you move away from me, but I need to tell you what happened today and how your life is going to be better soon now that I have this job and we can move.”<br><br>She moved away from the fridge and turned around to face him. She looked at him and then over his shoulder.<br><br>“Move?” she asked.<br><br>“I got a new job, a good one, and we can move now that I have the money, and if you  want to go somewhere warm, we can go anywhere you want. There are so many places and I can take you to -”<br><br>“We?” she asked. She looked down at her feet. “What do you mean ‘we?’”<br><br>Jack sat down on the floor in front of her. “But you can come along, you can be there with me, we can talk about anything and everything -”<br><br>Eliza stood up and moved away from him. She turned back to him quickly though and said, “You say we as if I’m not here,” she said.<br><br>She moved again and went to the bedroom. She opened the door but didn’t enter. She moved closer to the door and looked inside.<br><br>Jack followed her into the bedroom. He looked around at the bed - a single bed - and then at Eliza.<br><br>“I moved your clothes,” she said. “And I tried to change things around, but it’s still the same bedroom, it’s still the same house. But you never move on, do you? You just sit here and you go through the motions of moving on, but that’s all you do. You don’t actually move on, you just sit here and talk to me like I’m not actually gone. Like this is some sort of delusion and I haven’t actually left you. Like  I’ll be coming back one day. Like my death isn’t final, that it isn’t final. You can move on but I can’t, or you won’t let me?” she said.<br><br>Jack didn’t know how to reply to this. He stared at her for a second and then turned away.<br><br>“You know, you never did tell me where this new place is,” she said.<br><br>Jack turned around again to look at Eliza and thought about the answer. The room was empty except for Eliza and him, but it felt crowded now.<br><br>“It’s in the city, on the other side of town. It’s only about twenty miles from here. Just over there along the coast,” he said.<br><br>Eliza frowned and turned toward the window instead of Jack. She moved the curtain aside to look out. “Well at least it’s on the coast,” she said.<br><br>Jack moved a little bit closer to her and placed his hand on her arm. The movement startled her and she looked at him with an expression of surprise. She moved away from him and turned toward the side of the bed instead.<br><br>“Why are you moving?” she asked. “Aren’t you happy here? I mean, this is where we lived together, isn’t it? You know, when we were happy. This is the room that we shared.”<br><br>Jack moved a few steps closer to her and then sat down on the edge of the bed next to her. He was silent for a moment, but then continued to speak.<br><br>“It’s not that I don’t want to live here. I live here at the moment because I have nothing else, but that can change. I want to move out there so that we can be together again, you and me. We can be happy together and live in a nice house near the ocean, where it is green and warm all year round. It doesn’t snow there, does it?”<br><br>Eliza moved a little closer to him again and looked into his eyes.<br><br>“Tell me,” she said softly. “Why move to this place? Isn’t it just like our old place? Why not move somewhere",1
Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"not here,"" she said as the sniffles continued to rack through her body. ""I'm scared.""<br><br>""Who isn't here?"" John asked as he tried to figure out what she was going on about.<br><br>""The man that attacked me is,"" Jenna said before saying, ""Oh god. He's coming back.""<br><br>John looked over his shoulder and then back at the door of Jenna's house before looking up and down the road before saying, ""Jenna what are you talking about? What man attacked you?""<br><br>""The man...the one that made me like this,"" Jenna stammered out but before she could continue speaking he heard a loud bang from inside the house, then a louder thump followed by another bang and the line went dead.<br><br>John looked down at his cell phone in his hand and after another look at the front door just to make sure that it was locked he began backing away from it as his eyes grew large with fear for her safety. He tried to call her again but there was no answer so he hung up then threw his cell phone into his car before taking out a gun that he always kept in his car and shoving it into his belt. Then he kicked open the door of the house and ran up the stairs as he tried to figure out where the sound had come from, assuming at first that it had been in her bedroom. As he reached the top of the staircase he could feel his heart racing like mad as he held the gun out in front of him and with his other hand he began turning the doorknob to her bedroom.<br><br>She was on her back still in her pajamas and half covered by blankets but clearly unconscious as she lay there with a leg bent at an odd angle and a gash in her forehead that was bleeding freely down her face. ""Jenna!"" John said before dropping to his knees beside her bed and taking hold of one of her hands. It was cold to his touch so he quickly took off his sweatshirt then placed it over her body but as soon as it came into contact with her skin she began shaking violently as if she would shatter any second and then suddenly sat up with gripping eyes that were pure white.<br><br>""Get away from me,"" Jenna snarled at him and then grabbed his face between both hands before sinking her teeth into his neck, biting down hard enough that blood was flowing from the wound.<br><br>As Jenna drank from him, John tried to scream out but no sound left his throat but wheezing breaths. She was too strong for him to fight and it didn't take him long before he lost consciousness and slid off the side of her bed onto the floor below.<br><br>Jenna fell back down on the bed only after draining John dry and then licked the wound on his neck to close it up before sitting up and looking over at him. ""I'm sorry,"" she said as she looked down at her hand and saw blood on her fingertips, ""but I could not let you take me away.""<br><br>With that said Jenna stood up from her bed and moved over to John's body before leaning down over him and pressing her lips against his in a gentle kiss that lasted for several seconds before pulling away again. It was the first time since she had been changed into a vampire that she had kissed anyone, but this one had felt like goodbye. With that thought in mind she turned around then walked out of her bedroom door and into the hallway, stopping next to her bedroom window where she looked through it at all of the houses that were lit up with lights on inside of them. It was nighttime still so most everyone was asleep right now which meant that there would be no witnesses to what she was about to do.<br><br>Jenna pulled open the window and stepped over the ledge onto the ground outside, then closed it behind her as she turned back around to face the house next to hers. A moment later she felt warm hands taking hold of her arms from behind her and pulling her backwards with a force that caused her to fall flat against a male chest. She quickly tried to turn around again but before she could do so someone had moved up beside of her and wrapped their arms around both of hers, holding them close against her body. Then she felt something cold being placed against either side of her head and it was only when he spoke that she realized who it was.<br><br>""It's been quite some time since we've seen each other face to face, hasn't it?"" Michael said as he stood there in front of Jenna with sunglasses covering up his black eyes while his dark hair moved softly in the wind next to his pale face. ""I know that you still have my bracelet on your wrist,"" he said referring to the silver charm bracelet he had given her for their first Christmas together back when neither one of them had known what was going on between them.<br><br>""I'm sorry,"" Jenna said softly before turning away from him, ""but I cannot leave with you.""<br><br>Michael looked down at her and saw that the front door to her house had opened and someone was standing there watching them before closing it again. ""So you were involved with him?"" he asked after releasing his grip on Jenna and taking a few steps back.<br><br>""I have already brought him back,"" Jenna replied as she pulled a business card out of her pocket and handed it to Michael. ""The number on the card is to the place where they are keeping him until they decide what to do.""<br><br>Michael took the card from her then looked down at it as he felt his hand being grabbed from behind by Ellen who had just come out of Jenna's house and walked up beside him. She took his hand within hers before looking over at Jenna again. ""He was talking about going inside,"" she said trying to keep calm for herself, ""and I wasn't sure what he might do.""<br><br>""He didn't hurt me,"" Jenna said with a small smile on her face that faded when she saw Michael glare over at Ellen in anger.<br><br>""You should have given us a chance! Why couldn't you have just trusted us?"" he shouted angrily while moving towards her",0
Trevor Lockwood ends up being a serial killer who lures women to their death and Natalie narrowly escapes becoming his next victim .,"night and they start flirting with each other. She has a drunken one night stand with him and later learns that he actually is a lot older than he told her (in his mid-30's) and actually works as a photographer for a magazine. While working on one of his photography assignments, Natalie goes to the location of his shoot (a dark warehouse) and then realizes that it was actually all fake; there was no magazine or anything else. She also finds out that she's been led there in order to have sex with him in order to 're-shoot' the pictures of the model who got sick. When Natalie refuses, Trevor becomes violent towards her physically by trying to push her into having sex with him against her will.<br><br>Emotions: Natalie feels betrayed; this is because she was lied to by Trevor about who he really was and that he had intentions of raping her by doing the photo shoot under false pretenses. She feels worried that she may have gotten drugged or raped at some point during their sexual encounter because she can't remember any details about what happened between them but this is something she tries not to dwell on since she doesn't want to think about it any further than necessary. She also feels uneasy because she knows that every time someone walks through the apartment complex she lives in that they could really be the potential killer that she was in danger of meeting the other night.<br><br>Motivations: Natalie wants to find out who this strange man really is, but doesn't have any means of doing so. This is because she doesn't know who he actually is and feels too scared to even go to the police about what happened since she already made-out with him and had sex with him once before. She wants to find out where he lives in order to track him down and figure out what he was doing with her photos. The personal goal for this comic will be for Natalie to eventually find out who Trevor Lockwood is and if it's possible for her to bring him somewhere where she can confront him about abducting her from the nightclub in order to have sex with her against her will. She also wants to make sure that nobody else goes through what she went through at his hands and this is why a lot of subplots will develop over time; there will be another woman abducted by Trevor Lockwood, or another women who gets into a similar dangerous situation as Natalie did (such as a woman walking home late one night when she gets attacked by someone or something). -----------------------------<br><br>Now let's have a look at the structure of what went into creating these story elements:<br><br>As you can see, this is just an example of the type of story outline that I create when plotting out my stories. This is what I like to use and find the most useful when it comes to planning out the details of my stories but there are other types you can use as well; one that is often used by comic creators is listing down some index cards on a board and organizing them according to their chronology and then writing all of their ideas down as they come to you; be sure to include any idea you've had or any subject matter, even if it's something like ""I'm going to describe a car being driven"" or ""I think I'm going to show an animal running out of nowhere."" When doing this, make note of the times where you find yourself becoming stuck in your story and don't know how to continue it; this may mean that there's some missing information and if that's the case, then start working on doing research and coming up with ideas so that you can fill in these gaps by adding more details.<br><br>Go over your outline again and again until you have all the information needed for your story. Then go through your notes once more, deciding how best to present your story. Now that you have all the information, you can write your story in any way possible; just make sure that you know what goes where in order to have the right information included and in order to put forth the best presentation possible. For instance, a comic script can be followed by a prose novel or novella with all of your characters spoken dialogue included in it.<br><br>At this point, you should have a basic storyline for the first part of your story; any details that don't make sense at this point will most likely be ironed out during the next steps of creating your story but be sure to go over everything beforehand so that you don't waste time later when it comes to finalizing anything. I'm going to talk about my experience with other elements now and then give an in-depth look on how I implement these things into my stories when writing them down and people who are interested in trying them can see if they work well for them.<br><br>What is an Outline and Why do You Need One?<br><br>An outline is essentially a guide; it is something that helps keep track of all of the parts that make up your story as well as how they relate to one another. If something doesn't make sense, if you're unsure how something fits into your story or if you're missing a few details, this will help you out immensely. It is something that will present your ideas in a way that makes them easy to follow for anyone who views it, be it another writer or anyone else who is looking at your work. The more detailed your outline is, the better it will be because you can show every little detail that goes into making up the story and doing so will leave less room for mistakes when writing each scene. I usually include everything I want to show in my stories; all of the characters I want, how they interact with one another, what they look like and how they dress but I do not include any dialogue unless it's absolutely necessary because I personally find it very tedious to write dialogue and prefer to focus on my characters' actions instead.<br><br>Keep in mind that this isn't going to be a storyboard; an outline doesn't describe what each scene looks like because a lot of the time, this can change during writing/drawing/animating depending on what makes sense and what's necessary for telling your story properly without running into any issues. For example: If there is too much going on in one scene or too many characters",0
Shannon's paintings begin to take on a life of their own and Shannon starts to feel like her paintings are her new family.,"Stephen's piece last week with all of its text and heavy writing - its lack of life - but it was a good thing that he didn't listen to me and instead he rewrote his piece, making it something it was never supposed to be in the first place - something alive.I was glad I didn't tell him how much I hated it; if I had, he might have just given up on his piece, on us. He might have stopped caring about finishing his piece at all, not wanting us to see what we had done to him by giving him an F on this paper.""Did you really like my piece?"" Steven asked me after class.I just looked at him and smiled; I couldn't say anything because I was too nervous that I might say the wrong thing.I was more nervous than usual around Steven now because he had asked me to help him with his piece last week and even though we still weren't exactly friends, he seemed to like me more now. And there was also the fact that we'd kissed in front of everyone yesterday; it felt weird when everyone went back to acting like nothing happened after we kissed but then again it felt weird when we were still acting like nothing happened afterwards as well.""Do you want to walk home together before we go to class?"" he asked me.I said yes and we started walking to his next class, still holding hands. It was a pretty nice feeling when we were holding hands or when he would squeeze my hand when we were walking together. I wished that things could stay this way forever; I was so happy right now that it didn't really matter what happened in the future. It seemed like the sun was shining brighter today and the autumn leaves had turned a little more golden than usual.""How did you like my new piece?"" he asked me as we walked.""I liked it,"" I told him, ""it's not just about writing anymore though, it's about how you feel about writing now instead of how you've always felt about writing.""He smiled at me and squeezed my hand tight. Maybe our being friends wasn't such a bad idea after all - well at least not as bad as I thought it would be before yesterday.We walked in silence for a while until Steven finally said something else.""Will you still help me with my piece?"" I smiled at him again but this time kept walking instead of stopping because I didn't want to slow down the flow of time for us too much.""Of course,"" I told him; ""even though we're not friends, or even dating, I like helping you with your piece and if I didn't like helping you with your piece, then I wouldn't do it.""""Maybe you should do more things for the people that you like,"" Steven told me.""You mean like for people who are my friends?"" I asked him.""No,"" he said, ""just people that you care about.""""I don't know,"" I told him; ""do we even like each other?""""That's a stupid question,"" he said. ""When was the last time you thought about me without having to be reminded to think about me? When was the last time that I wasn't on your mind?"" he asked me.I couldn't answer him because he was right - what did that have to do with liking someone, though? Did liking someone have to mean being constantly on their mind? It's not like Steven had ever been so preoccupied by me that it would have been difficult for him to talk about anything else - where and when are we going to get together again, what are we going to do when we get together next time, why is he walking faster than me? Those kinds of questions were never popping into my mind - in fact, the only questions popping into my mind when it came to Steven were about our current relationship. For one thing, I wondered why he liked me enough to keep asking me out but then not be willing to consider dating me. Not that it mattered anymore because I didn't want anything more than friendship from him; it just seemed like a bad idea to be friends with someone you liked so much.How could I have fallen in love with someone without even realizing that I was in love with them?""I don't know,"" Steven told me but he was smiling now and squeezing my hand tighter than before; ""it's just not right that you only think about me when we're together and then spend the rest of your time thinking about everything else.""""I guess,"" I told him.""You think too much,"" he said, ""just go with the flow for once in your life.""""Let's go by this tree that's by the school entrance,"" Steven suggested when we got closer to the school entrance.We sat down together on a bench underneath a big oak tree and looked out at the lawn of the school grounds.""Is this where you usually sit?"" I asked him.""Sometimes,"" he said; ""most of the time though, we don't sit under an oak tree - we sit under an apple tree.""""An apple tree?"" I asked him.""Are you going to ask me where I sit?"" he asked me but this time, he was smiling at me.""Maybe,"" I said.He didn't tell me where or in what tree he sat with his friends but he did say that they sat together and talked about their feelings and how they were feeling inside. They also gave each other advice on how to be more happy and comfortable with themselves....etc.I thought it sounded really, really weird but I didn't say anything to Steven because if I did, then maybe he would stop talking and I kind of liked hearing him talk - it was like no matter what we were talking about, it always felt like just the two of us.Steven stayed for a long time after that - the bell rang for class before we even realized what time it was (we had been sitting there together for over two hours.)""Do you have any classes with Cal today?"" Steven asked me.""No,"" I told him; ""why do you ask? It's not like you would go to his classes if we had any together.""""No,"" Steven said; ""that wouldn't be a good idea - besides, Cal likes to have lunch by himself so he can think about things.""""Cal's never really struck me as someone",0

Jennifer decides to leave her family and start a new life.,".""<br><br>She said in an almost happy tone as she looked at him from the corner of her eye before getting off of her bed and walking towards the door. When she opened it, she saw Eric sitting on the couch with his phone in his hands, looking like he had been waiting for her to wake up.<br><br>""Good Morning."" he said with a small smile on his face as Jennifer closed the door behind her before walking towards him with a sigh. ""What's wrong? ""he asked, glancing up at her before looking back down at the screen of his phone again. He was reading an article about something that could help him get over this whole mess between them since he didn't trust himself when it came to talking or even trying to approach Jennifer about what happened between them yesterday.<br><br>""Nothing is wrong."" Jennifer replied back with a small shrug of her shoulders before walking into the kitchen to make herself some breakfast. She was hungry and she needed something to eat since the doctor told her that she needed to take good care of herself while pregnant because then James would be strong as well.She sat down on a chair before opening the package containing the crackers and taking one out with a sigh of relief. The whole situation was really starting to get to her and she wished that she could just curl up into a ball and hide from the world for a while until it all went away. But how could she do that when Eric was still sitting in the living room with no intention of doing anything else? There was no way for her to get any peace and quiet in this house unless she chose to leave them alone.She sighed as she thought about the plan that was running through her head, deciding if it was really worth it to go with it or not. She knew that doing what she wanted wouldn't be something good at all because she would have to make Eric hate her even more before going ahead with it, but what other choice did they have? They couldn't go on like this every day when they are simply pretending like nothing is wrong between them, right? She took another bite of her cracker before grabbing her glass of water and drinking some of it before looking up at Eric again.""Are you going to talk about what happened yesterday?"" asked Jennifer in a soft voice as Eric looked up at her for a moment before shaking his head slowly.""No."" he said in a small voice, glancing up at Jennifer once more before looking back down at his phone once again. ""We've been through this before and I don't want to get into it again just so you can feel better, Jennifer."" he said, raising his hands in front of him as he sighed. ""I'm sorry... But I'm not going to do that.""Jennifer looked down at the ground for a moment before nodding her head slowly.""Alright then."" she said in a soft voice, getting off of her chair before walking towards the door leading outside. She stopped for a moment before turning around and looking at Eric again. ""I'm going for a walk over there.."" she said in a shy voice, pointing at the back door that led to the backyard with a small smile on her face because she knew that she was punishing them both this way by making them spend more time together when they didn't want to be together anymore. ""Please stay here... I won't be long.""Eric looked up at her before sighing deeply as he closed his phone and put it down on the armrest of the couch. He saw how nervous Jennifer was acting and wondered what she was going to do out there when she left the house like this. Was she planning on running away from home? He shook his head slowly as he thought about that possibility while getting off of the couch and following after her.He got outside, seeing Jennifer walking towards the side of the house. She could feel Eric following after her and she knew that she would have to move fast if he wanted to stop her from doing what she planned on doing. She didn't want him to know that she was running away from home because how would it look if everything was going well and then suddenly, she disappears? She didn't want that, of course... But it looked like Eric wasn't about to let this go so she had no choice but to do something about it herself.""Jennifer..."" called Eric in a small voice as he watched her walk into the backyard and close the door behind herself before stopping in the middle of the yard, looking up at the sky before taking a deep breath. ""What are you doing?""""I'm going for a walk."" Jennifer replied back with a shrug of her shoulders while looking down at her feet before taking another deep breath.""Alright then.. You can go for a walk but don't go too far away, okay? You'll get lost and I don't want that happening to you."" he said in an encouraging voice as Jennifer looked up at him with wide eyes.""I won't get lost."" she said in a soft voice before sighing deeply as Eric nodded his head at her words and she walked away from him before he could say anything else. She walked around the house, heading towards the forest nearby, checking over her shoulder every now and then to see if Eric was following after her. She didn't want him to get in her way or stop her from doing what she planned on doing because she needed to focus on just getting out of their lives as soon as possible.She finally got to the edge of the forest and she walked into it with a sigh of relief while looking around at everything that was in front of her. This place gave her the comfort that she had been looking for over these past few months. She knew that this was where she belonged. She didn't belong with Eric anymore... She had never belonged with him if she were being honest with herself because once upon a time he had been the guy who made her life worth living, but now? Now he was making her life miserable by making them go through this awkward relationship. They were fake to each other and they hated each other's guts but they couldn't just get a divorce because that would be too messy for them both instead of something simple like taking a leave of absence from work or something along those lines because they were both working together at two different companies",0
"Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.","? Do you want the story to be sad, or happy? What, exactly, is the story going to be about? What is Jack doing now?<br><br>Sorry, I do understand what you mean by that, but I truly don't think your premise is clear enough for me to write a story based on it. Can you give us more information about what happened? Do you want the story to be sad, or happy? What, exactly, is the story going to be about? What is Jack doing now?<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Jack sighed softly as he knelt down again. It was ironic that even though they thought they'd had a perfect life together, it had been ripped to shreds and left irreparably broken now. ""I love you so much,"" he said again, as if it was a mantra he wanted to repeat over and over just in case she might be able to hear it somehow; ""and I miss you.""<br><br>He glanced around uncomfortably out into the crowds of people that were visiting with their families for a moment after just voicing those strangely intimate feelings aloud to her, but there wasn’t anyone standing nearby at all. There never were when he came here, not even on the days when he would purposely come in the mornings before any of his co-workers could catch him here in order to be alone with her again. He always felt a little embarrassed whenever he visited her, but there wasn’t anyone here to see and he didn’t have much more time left now for talking to her face-to-face.<br><br>Jack sighed again, this time with just a hint of sorrow, as he looked down at his wife’s grave one last time. There was a patch of freshly mown grass on either side of the gravestone to mark the spot where it had been on display during the funeral service. Her rich brown hair had been brushed out straight in all directions from her head, and she had been wearing a dark blue dress when she was laid to rest: just like she would have worn for their wedding day if she hadn’t died so far too soon. “Eliza...I promise you that I will never love any other woman as long as I live,"" Jack whispered softly as he slid his hand into his blazer pocket and grasped the single rose that he had brought there with him all day long. ""I can’t believe how long it’s already been since you were taken from me too soon. It’s been exactly six months to the day.""<br><br>Jack stood up and stepped back from the grave. He wanted to say more, but he couldn’t think of anything else to do or any other way he could possibly say goodbye. There was no point in talking to her any more anymore...and there would never be any answers again. She had told him that she loved him and that she always would right before she died in his arms, but it wasn’t enough anymore. Jack couldn’t go on without her, not after all they had been through together and all that they had meant to each other over the years that they had spent building their life together. He just couldn’t face another day without her. As long as he lived, there would never be anyone else for him; because if Eliza wasn't here with him anymore, then there was no one else he could ever want or love again...<br><br>Jack slid his hand down over the top surface of the rose in his pocket as he turned away from her grave and began walking away from it. He closed his eyes against the tears welling up behind them as he thought about how much worse this day was going to be after he spent the rest of it thinking about it. He couldn’t even go back to work; there would also be no point in seeing anyone besides her today. She had been his life, and now she was gone. It was a truth that he would have to live for the rest of his days with now, and nothing could ever change that fact.<br><br>Jack paused a moment as he walked through the grassy patch of beautiful wildflowers growing on either side of the gravel path leading through them, catching another glimpse of her grave from behind him before continuing his walk out of the cemetery. The bright morning sunlight silhouetted him against her resting place, making it look like a miniature monument built for him alone as he pushed its doors open and stepped out into the busy street beyond with one last look back towards it.<br><br>Today was such a tragic day for him...and there were still five hundred ninety-nine more left after this one...

"Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.","? Do you want the story to be sad, or happy? What, exactly, is the story going to be about? What is Jack doing now?<br><br>Sorry, I do understand what you mean by that, but I truly don't think your premise is clear enough for me to write a story based on it. Can you give us more information about what happened? Do you want the story to be sad, or happy? What, exactly, is the story going to be about? What is Jack doing now?<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Jack sighed softly as he knelt down again. It was ironic that even though they thought they'd had a perfect life together, it had been ripped to shreds and left irreparably broken now. ""I love you so much,"" he said again, as if it was a mantra he wanted to repeat over and over just in case she might be able to hear it somehow; ""and I miss you.""<br><br>He glanced around uncomfortably out into the crowds of people that were visiting with their families for a moment after just voicing those strangely intimate feelings aloud to her, but there wasn’t anyone standing nearby at all. There never were when he came here, not even on the days when he would purposely come in the mornings before any of his co-workers could catch him here in order to be alone with her again.

"Shannon lands her first major assignment, a feature on the inner city, but quickly discovers that the ugly reality of life in the city is far different from the dream she imagined.","her to be careful and make sure she wasn't in any danger...and that would just give Shannon a reason to be even more determined to find out what happened.<br><br>As she walked down the sidewalk, Shannon thought about all the detective novels her dad had read when she was growing up. He used to read them aloud to her so that they could share his stories together...and then he used to give her advice about writing her own stories. He had always encouraged her too; he had been looking forward to the day when Shannon's stories would be published. And now that day had finally come! Now it was time for Shannon to prove that Mike had not sacrificed his life for nothing...and even though he couldn't do it himself anymore, maybe a few of his friends could help him out!<br><br>""I'll investigate this story just like one of those pulp detective novels!"" Shannon told herself with a smile as she reached the police station and took a deep breath before going inside. Although she was nervous, she felt confident that everything would work out fine because this was what her father wanted! ""I'll figure out why Dad died just like he always wanted me to,"" the young girl added with a confident smile as she opened the door and stepped inside.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>Mike's Murderer<br><br>""This is the Boston Police Department, how may I help you?"" Shannon was surprised to hear a woman's voice on the other side of the line; she assumed it would be a man!<br><br>""Hi,"" Shannon replied a little bit nervously, ""I'm calling about one of your missing persons cases...a Michael Guzman."" Mike had been gone for two years already, but Shannon still felt nervous whenever she mentioned his name to anyone. She knew it wasn't silly in any way...he was her dad after all...but just the thought of him being gone forever made her feel extremely sad. She supposed that was why he was on her mind so much these days...because she really missed him.<br><br>""One moment please,"" the woman told her politely before putting Shannon on hold and leaving room for music. At least this gave Shannon time to think about what she wanted to say; normally if someone asked why she wanted to report someone as missing, she would just say they hadn't been in touch with her family for a while. But Mike had actually been missing for more than two years now, so that wouldn't work! In fact, technically he wasn't even considered to be missing anymore because no one had reported him missing. Since Shannon had called, the case was officially reopened and his disappearance would be investigated once again.<br><br>""I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,"" the woman told her once she came back on the line, ""how may I help you today?""<br><br>""My name is Shannon Guzman,"" she replied, keeping her voice as confident as she could. She didn't want this woman to start asking questions until Shannon had a chance to explain everything; she wanted to be able to tell her everything that she knew about Mike's case before anyone said anything else! ""My father, Michael Guzman, disappeared from his home two years ago,"" she continued without hesitation; this was why Mike's friends were going to help her out! ""I called because I wanted to let you know that I think he may not have disappeared of his own accord."" She wasn't sure if that was how it would sound or not but it was what came naturally at the moment so Shannon decided not to worry about it!<br><br>""I see,"" the woman said slowly after a long pause. Clearly no one had called in two years telling them they thought their loved one didn't just up and disappear...that must have been something they weren't used to hearing. ""I'm sorry to hear that you think your father may have been a victim of foul play.""<br><br>""Thank you for understanding; however, I do have a reason for believing this,"" Shannon explained, hoping that her voice didn't sound too shaky. She was sure no one had called in two years to say they thought their loved one hadn't disappeared at all! ""For one thing, he was working on an important story about the inner city and the police force.""<br><br>""Really?"" the woman asked with a confused look in her voice. Shannon nodded, unable to speak because she knew no one would believe her if she tried to tell them that someone had called just like this two years ago! But she was going to tell this woman everything and then see if they would help her figure out what happened...or at least try to find Mike's killer before she figured it out herself! ""I'm sorry but it sounds like you think your father's disappearance may be related to his work...and I'm sorry but I can't help you there,"" she told Shannon apologetically. ""If he disappeared under suspicious circumstances then you can report it to the department and we'll investigate again but we only investigate if foul play is suspected,"" she continued. ""Otherwise the case is considered closed.""<br><br>""I don't understand,"" Shannon explained slowly. ""Did you not hear me earlier? I called to report something suspicious.""<br><br>""Oh this isn't about what happened to your father,"" the woman said, shaking her head as if Shannon were being silly. ""I can tell you that from what I've read in the files, there was nothing suspicious about his disappearance and no evidence of foul play...it wasn't a murder or anything like that.""<br><br>""I don't understand,"" Shannon repeated slowly. ""I'm not the one who called...this is exactly why I wanted to call!"" She pressed her lips together again, trying to figure out how she had messed up; she was sure no one had told her Michael's case had been officially closed! Sure, he hadn't been reported missing because it was believed he had taken off on his own...but that didn't mean he wasn't a victim! It just meant he didn't have any friends or family who would care enough to report him missing in the first place! And there hadn't been any way for anyone else to find out what happened until Shannon started looking for answers on her own two years later!<br><br>""Look, all I can do is tell",0

The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,". “Just stay in the hall!”<br><br>Tim was frozen with fear and confusion. “What are you doing?” he asked quietly.<br><br>Julia took a deep breath and turned to Thelma. “Please get me out of here,” she said with difficulty, her voice barely audible. “I think that I’m going to be sick.”<br><br>Thelma nodded and reached for the door, but a loud crashing noise made her freeze in her tracks. Julia had turned around and saw the large dark figures moving towards them. It did not quite look like they were moving, but more like they were flowing. Then the other door opened and the little girl came walking slowly into the room.<br><br>“I am here with your doctor,” she said calmly and smiled at Julia. “He says that he will be able to help you relax and get your thoughts and feelings in order.”<br><br>Thelma moved quickly to the girl’s side and forced her back out of the door. She turned around to face the doctor.<br><br>“What are you doing here? Why are you treating my daughter this way? Why can’t I come in there with her?”<br><br>The doctor looked around the room, as if searching for an answer. He found none and started to move towards the door. “I need to talk to the patient alone, Mrs. Bates. Please wait in the hallway and out of sight until I call you back in.”<br><br>The doctor moved to the door and held it open, but Thelma had moved out of his way. She stood calmly in front of him, blocking his exit.<br><br>“No sir. You will not move from this office until you explain your intentions to this young lady and me and our doctor.”<br><br>The doctor seemed to stare at her for a full minute before he spoke again. “Are you the patient’s mother?”<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>“Do you believe your daughter needs medical or psychiatric treatment?”<br><br>Thelma moved her head slowly in a nod and waited for the doctor to speak. His voice was very calm and monotone as he replied, “I believe your daughter may need medical treatment, but not psychiatric therapy at this time. I recommend that she be seen at the local hospital , where we can give her medical attention and keep her under sedation until the medication starts to take effect.”<br><br>Thelma pulled her body straighter and showed no emotion on her face. “We will provide those services here, Doctor.”<br><br>The doctor shook his head slowly. “I cannot recommend that course of action. I believe it would be in the best interest of your daughter for her to be seen by a specialist at the hospital in Raleigh.”<br><br>Thelma nodded slowly and lowered her head.  “You will cooperate with us, Doctor. If you don’t, I will have you dismissed from this hospital and never allow you to practice medicine again in this county. I am an officer of the law and know how these matters are handled.”<br><br>Timothy Jenks stood and walked swiftly to the door. He opened it and stepped out into the hall. Thelma followed quickly. “Come with me, young lady,” she said as she led Julia out the door.<br><br>Thelma walked silently down the corridor and stopped in front of a closed door. They turned to look at Julia. She was trembling on the verge of panic. “Don’t worry, honey. It will be okay,” Thelma said as she entered the room and closed the door behind her. She walked to the bed and sat on the edge beside Julia.<br><br>Julia looked up at Thelma and started to cry. “What are they going to do with me, Mama?”<br><br>Thelma’s expression changed from one of seething anger to that of a loving mother. She walked slowly to Julia, put her arms around her, and held her close. “Oh, honey. I’m sorry. They are not going to do anything except listen to you and help you get well.”<br><br>“They? What do you mean? You mean they will just listen to me talk about this stuff? That’s all? ”<br><br>As she spoke, Thelma realized that Julia was thinking of going to a psychiatrist. She was relieved that the town doctor refused to heed Thelma’s request. Now, looking into her daughter’s face, she could see the fear and uncertainty that Julia was facing. “Yes, honey. They will listen to you and—“<br><br>Suddenly there was a sound at the door. Thelma turned and saw Karen Jones standing in the doorway of the bedroom. “The doctor wants to talk to you, Dr. Martin. They moved up your appointment.”<br><br>Thelma turned back around to face Julia and continued, “They moved up your appointment because I insisted they do so.” She smiled reassuringly at her daughter and then added, “They are going to  help you get well and I am sure everything will be fine.”<br><br>Julia hesitated, then asked, “So why are you crying?” Thelma turned away as the tears streamed down her face. Julia looked at Karen for understanding, but she had already gone back into the kitchen.<br><br>In the next few minutes, it became clear to Julia that more than one person in town was disturbed by the recent events. First, Julia’s friends avoided her, and when she spoke to them on the telephone they had little to say about anything. Then, one day a group of high school girls came by Julia’s house and began screaming at her.<br><br>“You are possessed by the devil! Get out of town! Go away! We don’t want you here anymore! Get out of town or we will kill you!” Julia was taken completely by surprise her and did not know how to react. She began crying uncontrollably.<br><br>Thelma came running out of the house with a pan in her hand, screaming at the girls to leave her daughter alone. Thelma then turned her attention back to Julia and said, “Julia, I’m so sorry. Please don’t cry. Just leave when you can and never come back here again. Please stop crying Julia, for my sake if not your own.”<br><br>Julia stood outside her house, crying and listening to the screams of the girls moving up the street. Finally, Julia left her house and ran as fast as she could into town. She ran until she could no longer run. She found herself at the town square, collapsed on the grass crying and gasping for air. She was breathing so heavily that it was difficult for her to speak, but Julia managed to say, “I don’t know what’s happening to me. I don’t think I can stay here anymore. Please help me! Please do something! Please make this stop!”<br><br>Julia did not know what else to say. She was exhausted and out of breath. Julia felt alone and scared. Julia sat in the town square, surrounded by trees and empty benches, and cried. Julia cried because she was scared, because she felt alone, because she did not know how to fix what was happening to her, and because she just did not want to feel this way",1
Jenna wakes up in the hospital a week later to find that she is now a vampire.,"the speakers were blaring loudly. ""Jenna?"" Matthias said with a puzzled voice. ""What's wrong? Where are you? I can barely hear you.""<br><br>The man cleared his throat as he said, ""Tell him to meet us at the abandoned amusement park down by the river as soon as possible.""<br><br>Jenna nodded her head before saying, ""Matthias? It's me. Something happened and...and I need you to meet me at the abandoned amusement park down by the river as soon as possible.""<br><br>Even though it was hard to hear what she was saying because of all of the music in the background, Matthias quickly replied, ""Okay Jenna. What happened? You're not making any sense. Have you been drinking again?""<br><br>""I'm not drunk!"" Jenna said as she covered her face with her hand and hung up on him because she was too distraught to talk or say anything else. She stared off into space for several seconds while trying to figure out whether she should even tell him what really happened or not because if he didn't show up then that would leave him open to being attacked by the guy with a sword and killed too.<br><br>The man sighed before walking over towards Jenna and holding the sword over her face as he said, ""If you don't call him again, I'll kill you right here, right now. Got it?""<br><br>Jenna held up her hands in surrender before saying, ""Okay! I'm calling him.""<br><br>A few seconds later she had Matthias on the phone again and this time she didn't even talk to him. She hung up on him again after just putting the phone to her ear, figuring that that would be enough of a message for him to get the point without actually telling him what was going on. Jenna then threw her cell phone to the floor and then fell to her knees as tears began rolling down her face.<br><br>The man sighed loudly before walking around behind them again and sounding slightly frustrated when he said, ""There's no way he's coming now. Do you have any other friends? Anyone else that can come?""<br><br>Jenna shook her head sadly before saying, ""No.""<br><br>The man rubbed his forehead with his free hand as he paced back and forth behind them while holding his sword out at them in one hand while trying to think of what to do next. Suddenly it seemed like an idea popped into his head because he stopped pacing, turned towards them, and said, ""Okay. I think I've got a plan.""<br><br>***<br><br>That evening Lieutenant John Dorsey II of the Chicago Police Department started off his shift just like any other day. He was currently driving down the highway towards his job in his patrol car as he listened to some music on the radio and looked out the window at all of the people walking along on the sidewalks below. From what he could see from up here it was a beautiful sunny day and there were two or three times as many people out today than there usually were.<br><br>Suddenly John's cell phone started ringing in his pocket and pulled it out, raising an eyebrow as his name flashed across the screen of his phone before he pressed talk on it and held it up to his ear. ""This is John Dorsey,"" he said into the phone. ""Who's calling?""<br><br>One Friday night a couple months back John had got a call from Jenna over at her home after she had gotten in a huge fight with her boyfriend. She had kicked him out because she didn't want him around anymore but when she woke up on Saturday morning to find that he hadn't left yet she wanted him gone, so she called John because he was the only other one that she knew that was around. When he showed up at Jenna's house he had found her upset about what had happened and Matthias Calenski in her kitchen, telling her that if she didn't give him another chance then it was over between them permanently. John had told Matthias to leave without any further explanation and after threatening to kill him if he didn't, he did.<br><br>Because of this John recognized the name on his cell phone when he saw it flash up on the screen so he smiled slightly and said into the phone, ""Hey there little lady. What's going on tonight?""<br><br>""Please help me,"" Jenna said in a voice that was cracking with sobs as she tried to hold back tears. ""Please.""<br><br>""What's wrong? Are you okay?"" John asked as he quickly slowed down his car and pressed the brake as hard as it would go as he tried to figure out where she was calling from. ""Is it Matthias again? I told you to leave him alone if I ever heard from you again.""<br><br>Jenna shook her head but still managed a few tears before saying, ""No. It's not Matthias.""<br><br>""Then what is it?"" John asked. ""What do you need help with?""<br><br>""Please come and get me,"" Jenna said. ""I don't really want to talk about it over the phone.""<br><br>John rubbed his forehead and sighed before saying, ""We can't keep doing this Jenna. We're friends but I can only do so much for you.""<br><br>""Please,"" Jenna said again as she began crying harder.<br><br>As John listened to her beg him he was sure that she sounded like she was in more trouble than she had been in before and although he wasn't too happy about him having to help her every time that her boyfriend got too aggressive on her, he was always willing to help a friend if it meant getting them away from a bad situation. ""Alright,"" he said after bit as he pressed the gas pedal down harder on his car and sped off down the highway at breakneck speeds. ""I'll be there in five minutes.""<br><br>***<br><br>When John knocked on the door of Jenna's house ten minutes later no one answered it so he took out his cell phone and called her again, listening as the phone rang only once before she picked up and brought it up to her ear. ""He's",0
"Mary Smith, George Smith, Jessica Doe, and John Doe all give testimony in court and John Doe is ultimately convicted and sent to prison.","to the bottom of this soon before it becomes a bigger problem.”<br><br>Patrick nodded his head in agreement before saying, “I was thinking about going over to Alfa's bar; do you want to come with me?”<br><br>James smiled and answered, “Of course…it's like old times again with you back in our lives Mary.”<br><br>Patrick couldn't help but laugh at his brother as they headed over to the bar together; things had seemed so bleak in their lives not too long ago but now it seemed that everything was finally turning around for the better for them.<br><br>Chapter 4 – The Big Fight<br><br>Once the officers had left the alleyway, Mary stood there for a moment staring down at her hands which were trembling from the excitement of what had just happened. She had barely been able to believe her eyes when she realized that they were shaking and she wondered if there was something wrong with her or if perhaps just being around Patrick was enough to make any woman's hands shake out of excitement. She let out a long deep breath as she tried to clear her head; things were going too well right now and it would be foolish of her not to take advantage of this chance that she had been given.<br><br>“I really can't believe that it happened just like that; I wasn't even able to realize what was happening until it was over with and I couldn't believe how easily I tricked him.”<br><br>Mary smiled as she thought about how easy it had seemed when she first started this plan; the hardest part of it all was trying to get Patrick to not want her anymore, but once she had gotten past that hurdle then everything else seemed to be falling into place all on its own. She suddenly realized that she was breathing a bit heavily from being so nervous and she sat down on the ground in front of the fence and tried to calm herself down. It was obvious that she needed something more than just a few minutes to relax, but instead of turning to drugs or alcohol like countless other people did, Mary turned her thoughts towards one thing that always made her feel completely relaxed: her husband. She closed her eyes tightly and let out a low long moan as she thought back on their time together; the way he would smile when they first met at the park, how he would touch and caress her body until she couldn't think straight anymore…it all made her heart race with excitement again as if it were all happening all over again. Mary kept her eyes closed tightly as she let her mind wander and she thought back to all of their first dates and even the first time that they had ever slept together.<br><br>Mary let out a sharp gasp of air as she suddenly remembered the way that he had taken her virginity; there was a sharp pain in her heart when she realized that he hadn't even been aware that it was her first time. She had always been a virgin for many reasons, but the most important reason being because she wanted to give herself to someone special who would cherish it and treat it as something special because of how much it meant to her. The only thing that seemed more painful than realizing that Patrick never saw anything special about their night together was the fact that he had rather callously left her life without saying goodbye or doing anything special for her; he didn't even take care of any protection before arriving at his house late one night…she knew very well what could have happened if she had become pregnant with his baby and she shuddered at the thought of how different things might be right now if she had gotten pregnant with his child.<br><br>It didn't take long before Mary began to cry, though this time they were tears of frustration rather than pain. She had worked so hard to get back on her feet after the divorce and she had finally gotten her life together and everything was finally going so well…she couldn't allow Patrick to ruin this for her or she would be right back where she started. She knew that he was probably a scumbag who didn't care about anyone but himself, but even a scumbag could have a change of heart and if he saw that Mary was no longer in his life then maybe it would make him feel bad enough to come back into hers. Mary shook her head as she wiped the tears from underneath her eyes; there was no way that Patrick would ever feel anything for her again and whatever he felt for her before had likely been nothing more than some stupid love spell that time had broken.<br><br>Patrick did have magic powers, Mary thought to herself, which was the only reason why she could understand why he might have fallen in love with me…but what use are those powers if they can't make him stop being such an asshole?<br><br>For a moment Elizabeth breathed deeply as she tried to get herself together; even though it seemed silly to think back on all of this when it had happened so long ago, it also felt like yesterday as well. She knew that she was being dramatic, but she also knew that if Patrick somehow heard about this then he would be the one to blame for it. Even though it wasn't specifically his fault that he left her without saying goodbye, it was his fault for acting like such a jerk after their night together and if he could change things then she was sure that he would…but then again, if he really cared about her then wouldn't he have recognized his mistakes before things got to this point?<br><br>Elizabeth turned her thoughts toward something else when her phone suddenly began to vibrate in her pocket; having had a pretty bad day in general so far, she hoped that any call from Justin would cheer her up and give her something else to focus on s0he reached into her pocket and answered the phone happily.<br><br>""Hey Justin, what's up?"" Elizabeth asked as she wiped a stray tear from underneath one of her eyes.<br><br>""Oh hey Lizzy…what's wrong?"" Justin asked softly. ""I can tell you're upset…""<br><br>""It's nothing,"" Elizabeth responded with a sigh. ""My day has just been pretty awful so far…but I'm sure it'll get better soon."" She paused for a moment as",0
"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.",", causing Jenna to run around Ellen's back in an attempt to get away from him.<br><br>""He's right,"" Ellen said as she looked towards Jenna before taking a step backwards and facing Michael, ""she didn't need us.""<br><br>""I'm sorry you feel that way,"" Jenna said as she ran over to her front yard and then turned around to look at Michael and Ellen one last time, ""but I have to go.""<br><br>Michael stood there for a moment looking at Jenna before turning towards the direction of where he could feel his car parked somewhere within this neighborhood. He couldn't bring himself to say goodbye anymore than he could stop what he was about to do. Pulling out the card that he was still holding in one hand, he unfolded it and read the number on the card before looking back up at the house across from his which had just been left empty by someone who had broken his heart. He only hoped that they would be able to make up for what they had lost. With that thought in mind he turned away from this house and headed off towards his car.<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>That was when it happened, just as Michael had been about to turn a corner down an alley for cover, Jack suddenly lurched up and looked around him while placing his hand on his head. His vision was impaired as he struggled to adjust to the daylight, but he knew what he had to do regardless of how horrible it might be. Getting off of his knees, he walked over towards the side of the building he was standing next to and pulled out a stake which had been hidden in there before using that same hand to wipe away the few tears that had just fallen from his eyes while they were adjusting.<br><br>""I'm coming for you,"" Michael said in a low voice as he opened up the business card again and stuck it back into his pocket out of sight.<br><br>With that thought in mind, Jack headed off towards Michael's car and got inside of it before starting it up and driving away into the night.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>""She did what?"" Ellen asked with a gasp after hearing Jenna's words which she had just relayed down the phone from her own cell phone that she was holding on her shoulder. ""She didn't give you a chance to talk? She just ran off in tears?""<br><br>""Yeah,"" Jenna replied softly while leaning back against her dining room chair before sighing sadly, ""I don't think she's going to come back.""<br><br>""I'm really sorry, sweetie,"" Ellen said after a moment as she looked over at the window and wondered what Michael might be doing at this very moment. Had he gone off to search for Jenna? Was he angry with her? Or was this whole situation just going to hit him like a ton of bricks and make him realize that he had lost the best thing in his life? ""But you have to give the guy a chance. He loves you too much not to.""<br><br>""I know. I just... I guess now I have no reason not to go out there and find someone else. Maybe I'll look up some of those vampires and see if they're available?"" Jenna replied with a forced chuckle as she leaned forward against the table before placing her face into her hands as she knew that it would be a long time before everything was back to normal for everyone involved.<br><br>Chapter 22: Downfall So, what happens when one has found their soulmate, but then finds out that their life is about to come crumbling down around them quickly? Is it only natural for them to do everything they can in order to preserve their own life while also trying not to be selfish towards the person they love? Or are they going to try and find a way to give up what they've wanted for so long in order to do right by their partner?<br><br>The way that Michael had always felt about Nicky was simple even if it wasn't romantic. It was love at its purest form, but one that he had resolved himself to not having. He knew it would never be returned, and yet he still held onto the idea of being friends with her for the rest of his life regardless of how impossible that situation might seem.<br><br>But now everything had changed, and in a single night things were flipped upside down very quickly. There were now records of vampires all over the world, he seemed to have been injected with their blood without his knowledge or consent... and Nicky had just left him there with everything else that was on his mind for reasons which he could only assume involved his newfound status as a vampire. Michael wasn't sure how she knew about it either, but it didn't really matter that much most of all because he loved her anyways despite any reasonings she may have come up with behind why she had left him there alone.<br><br>All he wanted to do was go out there and find her right now so that they could talk things out, but Michael couldn't even think straight at the moment. He didn't know where she was or who she was with, and he wasn't sure he had enough strength in his legs to walk right now.<br><br>But regardless of it all, there was a part of him that knew that everything would turn out all right as long as he could be with her again.<br><br>---------------------<br><br>""Oh my God! Oh my God... it's no wonder she left you there! You're like one of them now, aren't you? Oh my God.. oh my God... are you even alive? You look pale like them.""<br><br>""Just calm down, please,"" Michael begged weakly as he looked up at Jenna who was standing over him in the middle of the forest. Her eyes were wide with shock and her hands were shaking slightly as if afraid that touching him might kill her somehow. ""I'm still me.""<br><br>""How can you say you're still you?"" Jenna asked in surprise before looking around the room briefly to make sure that they were alone before asking, ""You drank blood didn't you? You ate raw meat!""<br><br>""They injected some kind of unknown fluid into my body",0
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.",". “You are not a bad girl!” he barked in an excited voice.<br><br>Then the little dog suddenly stopped wagging his tail and looked at Kitty very seriously. He stared at her for a moment, then said “I don’t understand why somebody would yell at you for being a bad girl when you’re not—can I help you? Can I be of any assistance to you in any way?”<br><br>Kitty did not know what to say. She began staring at the ground, not sure what to do next.<br><br>Lulu Laverne stared at Kitty for a long moment. Then he nodded his head and smiled again. “I see that you have a problem,” he said in an understanding voice. “In fact, I think I can help you solve it!”<br><br>Kitty stared at the little dog. He was so kind and friendly that she almost forgot about the other men shouting at her.<br><br>“What is your name?” Kitty finally asked, still staring at the ground.<br><br>Lulu Laverne’s tail started wagging again, and his little ears perked up. “My name is Lulu Laverne,” he said in a friendly voice. Kitty looked up at him and smiled. It was nice to see that a dog could be so friendly, especially when some people were being so cruel to her. “And what is your name?”<br><br>Kitty hesitated a moment before answering. She still did not know if Sergei was still watching her and listening, but she realized that the kind little dog seemed to genuinely care about her. She began looking up at him again and said, “My name is Kitty Pawsky. I’m a private detective who moved here from the city because I like country life. But now there are some big problems here in the park, and I think it would be good if we all worked together on it. Do you think we can do that?”<br><br>Lulu Laverne stopped moving for a moment, and his happy face slowly began to turn a little more serious. “I see you moving your tail,” Kitty said gently. “Is there something wrong? Do you not want to talk about it?” <br><br>Lulu Laverne turned his head away from her. “It’s okay,” he muttered in a quiet voice. “I just have one friend here in the park who likes to tease me sometimes. He leaves catnip mice and feathers all over my house so that I’ll get into trouble when the other dogs see them. Sometimes he even comes inside on of the houses and scares me while I’m sleeping, but then he always leaves a treat for me by my bed, so it’s okay.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “So your friend is the one who does these bad things?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne shook his head. “No, he doesn’t do it! He just likes to watch me get into trouble.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “Then it sounds like he’s the one who is doing these bad things, since you keep getting into trouble,” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne sighed. “I told him to stop a long time ago, but he won’t listen,” he said. “And now I have to go in this house and do my homework…”<br><br>Kitty frowned. She knew that this was a bad thing that this friend was doing to Lulu Laverne, but she wasn’t exactly sure how to help him.<br><br>“Why doesn’t your friend listen to you?” she asked.<br><br>Lulu Laverne sighed again and shook his head. “I don’t know, he just doesn’t like to be told what to do, I guess.”<br><br>Kitty thought for a moment. “But you are his friend, and he must care about you a lot, right?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne smiled. “Yeah, he does care about me a lot,” he said. “You know, I’m starting to think that maybe I’ll just go into the house and tell my parents about it so they can help me.”<br><br>Kitty smiled as well. “That sounds like a good idea,” she said. Then, after a moment, she continued . “Do your homework first though, okay?”<br><br>Lulu Laverne laughed. “All right, I’ll do that first!” he said. He started walking off through the park as Kitty called after him.<br><br>“Lulu, stay safe, okay?” she said.<br><br>Lulu Laverne stopped and turned around to look at her. She smiled again. “I will, Kitty, I will!” he said. He continued walking towards his house as Kitty watched him go. She turned her gaze back to the park.<br><br>She saw that Sergei was heading for the swing set. The dogs were looking at him as he approached them. Kitty didn’t understand it, but she was glad that the dogs had someone to play with besides just each other and her; it’s much better when there are more people around to make everything a little more fun.<br><br>Kitty moved towards the swing set, ready to go off on another adventure into the dog park and try to figure out what was going on. She had followed Sergei to where he always seemed to go, and now she would work her way through the park and see what sort of clues she could discover.<br><br>There was something going on here, Kitty was sure of it. She moved closer to the swing set. The park was quiet. Nothing moved except for the trees and the leaves on them. Kitty moved towards the slide near the swings and moved in a position where she could see both of the swings.<br><br>She was moving closer to the swing set when she saw it – a catnip mouse. On the ground next to one of the swings sat a fluffy little gray catnip mouse with black ears and green eyes. It was moving from side to side as if trying to get the attention of the dogs at the park. Kitty moved over to where that was, and then reached out and picked up the toy.<br><br>She moved over to where she had last seen Sergei, moving slowly and carefully so that she didn’t step in anything in the park. She moved carefully, because there was a lot of stuff on the ground in the park. There were food scraps, leaves, pine cones and other stuff on the ground all over the place. She moved carefully so that she wouldn’t step in any of this stuff. She could see where some of it came  from – a lot of it had fallen from the trees overhanging the park. But some of it was just there for no reason.<br><br>As she moved ahead, she saw that Sergei wasn’t at the swing set anymore. He was near the slide, just moving back and forth like he had been before. He was looking at her as she walked towards him.<br><br>“You’re coming to play with me, aren’t you?” said Sergei while wagging his tail at Kitty. “You found my mouse! Now we can chase each other around – it will be so much fun!”<br><br>Kitty stared at him, not sure what to say. She didn’t know why he had this mouse with him, or where he was keeping the rest of them. And then she thought about what he had said about killing the dogs. She didn’t want to be around him if he was going to kill more dogs. She backed away from him, and then ran back towards the entrance of the park.<br><br>Sergei started chasing after her again, but this time Kitty didn’t stop. She just kept running until she could get out of the park – she didn’t know if the other dogs were here because they wanted to play, or if they thought the same thing she did. But she couldn’t stay and find out.<br><br>As soon as Kitty was out of the park, she saw that Jose Cuervo was nearby to her, and called out to him.<br><br>“Hey, Jose Cuervo! I need your help!”<br><br>She waited for him to come over and talk to her, but he just ran past her, and then she saw him enter the park. She started walking towards the entrance again, but didn’t go in – there were two other dogs there, and she wasn’t sure if they wanted to play with the other dogs or not.<br><br>“Hey, hey! Stay there! What’s your problem? Come back here so we can talk.”<br><br>Kitty walked towards where the two dogs were. When she got close enough, she shouted, “What’s going on here? Why are all of you in the park – did you get lost or something? I thought this was a place for dogs to come and play, not for them to",1

Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,", asked me if I would like to paint a picture with him. I don't remember much about the specifics of that day, but I do remember that it lasted all afternoon and included a lot of silence while both my uncle and I sat there quietly and painted. Sometimes, he would sing along with the radio, and sometimes he would just hum. He was a retired soldier who had served in Vietnam for several years before returning home without any wounds or scars on his body to show for his bravery; at least none that he ever spoke about to anyone. It was a quiet past that he kept away from us - from my siblings and me - because we were still too young to understand what it was like to hold down a machine gun or toss hand grenades at the enemy, or even see anyone die beside you because you had no other choice than to keep fighting until you were either killed or wounded.But when my uncle sat down in front of a blank canvas with his paintbrush in hand, it was as if he came back home - as if his mind had left Vietnam so long ago that it didn't matter anymore; he never spoke about it anyway so why bother? He wanted nothing more than to forget all of those memories and go back to being a painter again now that he was retired from the military. He was happy doing what he did.It made me happy to see him with a paintbrush in hand and a canvas of blankness before him as he painted our backyard with all of the flowers that mom had planted - even the ones that took up space in our window boxes during the summertime; they were always blooming and it seemed as if there were so many of them that they would never go away. I never understood why he was painting those flowers; they were everywhere and didn't really need to be on paper.But my uncle wanted to keep them alive, so maybe that's why he painted them.I looked at his canvas, realizing then that it all made sense - I couldn't understand why a soldier would want to keep flowers alive when there were lots of them outside already, but now I understood everything about what it meant to paint: you paint for yourself because it makes you happy, not for anyone else or for any reason at all; you just do it because you love the feeling of holding a brush and mixing together pretty colors on a blank canvas... how could you not want to do that?I finally understood my mother's paintings enough so I could tell her about my uncle's paintings after she asked me about one of them hanging in our living room - a colorful painting of a tree with little birds resting on some of its branches - and my eyes glimmered with tears as I explained to her, ""Mommy... he's not alive anymore.""My mother stopped moving around the kitchen and turned around, listening, waiting for me to finish. ""And?"" she said, sensing that there was more coming, knowing me well enough to know when I was finished telling my story.I felt the tears begin to fall and wiped them away with the back of my hand. My mother hugged me then and we cried together until she asked again if there was anything else that I wanted to tell her; she could tell there was something in me that wanted to be said but wasn't ready yet.""Hmm..."" I said, thinking about it for a few seconds before reaching into one of my pockets and pulling out some long strands of hair that were wrapped around a small rock.""It's Mommy's hair,"" I told her, giving the rock a squeeze before embracing her again.In the next chapter: Chapter 5- from Shannon’s perspective-----------------------------I liked how everything seemed so familiar; it made me feel like I had been here once before.But this was a new place for me - a place far from home where I had never been before. I couldn't remember ever being here before, so it was a little strange for me to feel this way. It was as if my mind was in two places at once; one of them, the familiar one, being home, and the other one being here, where I didn't know anyone and didn't belong to anyone.But it wasn't entirely strange to me either because I felt like this place was meant for me, like this place and all of its people could be my home if I wanted it to be.I had found my purpose that day in English class when we read our pieces aloud as a class - Stephen's piece hadn't changed much since we first read it aloud together; only a few lines were added that seemed to fit together with his words better than they did in the beginning. He had made his piece more than just an essay about writing and about how he thought about writing all the time; he added new lines that showed what he felt about writing now - how he saw writing as an opportunity for him to create something from nothing and make others happy with his work.When Steven finished reading his piece aloud again, Mr. Wilson looked around at all of us and then said, ""Well, guys, what do you think about Steven's piece now that he's rewritten it?""Carmen raised her hand and said that she still found it boring and stupid.Richard sent his paper from last week flying through the air toward Mr. Wilson and yelled, ""Man, I can't believe you gave me an F on this! This is total crap!""Mr. Wilson took Steven's paper to the front of the room so everyone could see it and then said, ""I really like this piece a lot more now that he has re-written it; let me know what you think.""We all started talking at once after that; everyone had something to say about Steven's piece. Some people were praising him for improving his work while others were saying that they liked his new piece just as much or even better than the old one.""The beginning seems very good to me,"" Carlos told him. ""It made me want to read more.""What a bunch of hypocrites we were being - it seemed like when we didn't like something we didn't have anything nice to say about it; but when someone did something great, we all ran over there as fast as we could to compliment them on their work. Maybe I was being a hypocrite too because I hated",0
"Natalie Harper makes a deal with Trevor Lockwood, a man she met online, to meet him in person in exchange for money so that she can pay her rent .","Natalie Harper made small talk with Trevor Lockwood online for several months. She was attracted to his confidence and good looks, even though he was nearly twenty years her senior. She saw herself as a confident woman, but she lacked the courage to approach him in public, nor would she do so out of respect for her boyfriend. So Natalie Harper had turned to the internet, where she found Trevor Lockwood. He was interested in meeting her in person, if she had enough money for their date. Natalie Harper agreed and they set up a time and place to meet. Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what kind of man she would date. Natalie Harper said that she would go out with someone like Trevor Lockwood, although he was not much older than her. Natalie Harper asked Trevor Lockwood if he was married. He said he wasn’t and had no children. She asked him if he lived alone, and again, his answer was positive. Natalie Harper met Trevor Lockwood in a coffee shop on the second floor of a shopping center in East Sacramento. She asked him to meet her there, but she did not tell him why. She gave him the agreed-upon amount of money—five hundred dollars—which he assured her would be enough for their date . Trevor Lockwood then gave Natalie Harper an address in rural Northern California and told her to come there. Natalie Harper was aware of Trevor Lockwood’s offer prior to this meeting, but she just needed to talk with him face-to-face to make sure he really meant her no harm. Natalie Harper got  in her car and drove towards the area where Trevor Lockwood told her he lived. She turned off Interstate 80 and drove on the country roads that led into his neighborhood. The roads were isolated, but she had a small map with the directions that Trevor Lockwood had given her. Natalie Harper arrived at his home after driving for about an hour. It was a large house set on a hill, surrounded by forest land. Natalie Harper parked her car on the side of the road and walked up to the front door of the house. She knocked and was immediately greeted by Trevor Lockwood, who opened it with a key he retrieved from inside.  Natalie Harper stepped into the house and greeted Trevor Lockwood.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was wearing a black short-sleeved shirt underneath a red cardigan sweater. His face was clean-shaven, except for a goatee that was trimmed close to his mouth. He had dark brown hair, short at the sides and about two inches long in the back. His eyes were blue and he gave off a strong and commanding presence to those he met. Trevor Lockwood was twenty-four years old and living with his parents in their five-bedroom house. He worked part-time at a small marketing firm in San Francisco, but his income was not very high. Trevor Lockwood invited Natalie Harper to sit down on the couch in his living room.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper how she liked driving up to his house. She said that she had enjoyed the drive, as it was quiet and peaceful. Trevor Lockwood moved to the edge of the couch and cleared a spot for Natalie Harper. Trevor Lockwood moved closer to Natalie Harper and sat down next to her.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood told Natalie Harper that he really enjoyed talking with her online and that he would have much preferred talking with her in person, but circumstances had prevented him from doing so. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand up to Natalie Harper’s shoulder.<br><br>Natalie Harper reached for Trevor Lockwood’s hand and placed it on her thigh. She looked at his lips and then smiled at him as she moved her head closer to his mouth. Trevor Lockwood moved his head away from her.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper if she had thought of any names for the business venture they were discussing. Trevor Lockwood explained that he had already thought of a name, but he was always willing to listen to suggestions from others. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand slowly up the inside of her thigh and moved it towards her crotch.<br><br>Natalie Harper moved Trevor Lockwood’s hand away. She was surprised that Trevor had touched her so soon in their conversation, as they still had so many details to discuss. She told Trevor Lockwood of two possible names that she wanted to consider, and Trevor Lockwood nodded his head.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked if he could move closer to Natalie Harper on the couch. Natalie Harper agreed and Trevor Lockwood moved next to her on the couch.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what she wanted him to do",1
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"Anna Cooper entered the office, a middle-aged black woman with a kind face. She wore a white uniform shirt and black pants that fit perfectly, even if her employer, Mrs. Miller, was not a size six. Mrs. Miller was sitting behind the principal’s desk, typing into her computer. A computer Anna Cooper had never seen before and would not have known how to use if it had been offered to her.<br><br>She stood at attention in front of the desk. She was a janitor and she wanted to show respect for her office, but mainly because there was no one else around. Her first day on job she had come early to get a feel for the place, and now she was waiting patiently.<br><br>Anna Cooper did not know if she would enjoy working for Mrs. Miller yet. But at least she had her looks going for her, and that was more than most of the other janitors at the school could say. Anna Cooper realized that she was being hard on herself. She was pretty, but she was also old. Not old in years, but certainly in looks. And she knew that Mrs. Miller thought she looked like a grandmother-type person, which wasn’t a compliment in Anna’s opinion.  But she was almost forty and did not want to look like she was twenty-five. She had been so young when her daughter died.<br><br>Anna Cooper felt that the principal did not even know her name yet, but Anna Cooper knew Mrs. Miller’s and had studied it carefully in case the principal expected to be called by her first name. It was a complicated one, Karen, but Anna was ready for it.<br><br>Finally the door opened and Karen walked into the room. Anna could tell at once that something was bothering her. “Mrs. Miller?” she said as she approached the desk, then  stopped briefly to give the principal more space. “I’m Anna Cooper.”<br><br>Mrs. Miller held out her hand and said quickly, “Please call me Karen. We need to be on first name terms, Anna. So I hear you are an excellent janitor and that you come highly recommended.”<br><br>Anna Cooper knew that the principal was trying to be friendly, but she was feeling off-put by the woman. And she didn’t like to be called Janitor instead of by her title. But she wanted it known that she didn’t take any nonsense from anyone. “I am not a janitor, Mrs. Miller. I have a title and I wish you would use it when addressing me.”<br><br>There was a brief silence after this statement, but then the principal said in an apologetic tone, “Of course you are, Anna. You are the head janitor and that’s what everyone calls you, right?”<br><br>“No! That is not correct. I am the Director of Facilities Management. Please call me by my title, Mrs. Miller. Or Ms Cooper if you prefer to be polite.”<br><br>Karen frowned at this and then said, “Well, I’ll just call you Janitor Cooper. It’s easier that way. Now, I need to know if you have any special talents in cleaning supplies? Do you use a certain kind of mop? How do you like to clean the floors?“<br><br>It was clear that Karen was trying to cover up for her earlier rudeness, but Anna Cooper wasn’t going to let her off the hook. She was offended by the term Janitor and it was also clear that Karen Miller had a problem with following orders. She was already starting to suspect that this would not be a good working relationship.<br><br>However, while this is something that she could work with, there were much more pressing issues. Anna Cooper needed to know what kind of writing was on the chalkboards and whether or not there were any more symbols that matched the one Daniel had shown her.<br><br>“I have no special talents in cleaning supplies,” Anna Cooper said directly. She figured this would get the discussion going again in the right direction.<br><br>“Well, that’s just great! We’re going to have a nice long talk about this ,” Karen Miller snapped.<br><br>“I think that is a bad idea,” Anna Cooper responded, “But it seems to me that you have an agenda and I don’t think it has anything to do with helping me out. So I suggest we end this conversation right here.”<br><br>The principal looked at the janitor for a second and then seemed to deflate. “Okay, but if that symbol shows up again, even on the back of a piece of paper in the trash can, I want to know about it first thing. Do you understand?”<br><br>One of the most obvious aspects of symbolism on the chalkboard is that it includes pictures of crucifixion.<br><br>Crucifixion is an old form of execution in which someone is nailed to a wooden cross. Crucifixion was originally meant as a form of punishment for those who were considered evil or heretics. Crucifixion was widely practiced by the Romans, but became increasingly unpopular in Western Europe.<br><br>Crucifixion was outlawed in some countries during the Middle Ages, but it was still practiced in England until 1853, and remained a legal method of execution in some of the world until very recently. Crucifixion is an extremely unusual method of execution for modern times, and it has been used mostly by people who are considered to be fringe groups or religious extremists.<br><br>Flailing crucifixions is a specific form of crucifixion where the victim is tied and whipped before being nailed to a cross. Flailing crucifixions refers to the violent whipping that usually accompanies crucifixion. Flailing is not an official part of the method of crucifixion, but it does occur often in countries that still practice it. Flailing is typically done with sharp metal rods or other implements, and often includes brutal beatings. The beating takes place while the cross is being raised off of the ground, and flailing is supposed to make the crucifixion more painful. Crucifixions are sometimes depicted in art, including famous works on the subject by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Flailing crucifixions are more common in modern times than flogging deaths, but depictions of both continue to appear in mainstream art.<br><br>Flailing crucifixions have been condemned by many religious leaders over the years. During the Middle Ages, flailing was condemned by Pope Gregory IX, who called it a sacrilegious act.<br><br>Crucifixion is an extreme form of torture,",0
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,", asked me if I would like to paint a picture with him. I don't remember much about the specifics of that day, but I do remember that it lasted all afternoon and included a lot of silence while both my uncle and I sat there quietly and painted. Sometimes, he would sing along with the radio, and sometimes he would just hum. He was a retired soldier who had served in Vietnam for several years before returning home without any wounds or scars on his body to show for his bravery; at least none that he ever spoke about to anyone. It was a quiet past that he kept away from us - from my siblings and me - because we were still too young to understand what it was like to hold down a machine gun or toss hand grenades at the enemy, or even see anyone die beside you because you had no other choice than to keep fighting until you were either killed or wounded.But when my uncle sat down in front of a blank canvas with his paintbrush in hand, it was as if he came back home - as if his mind had left Vietnam so long ago that it didn't matter anymore; he never spoke about it anyway so why bother? He wanted nothing more than to forget all of those memories and go back to being a painter again now that he was retired from the military. He was happy doing what he did.It made me happy to see him with a paintbrush in hand and a canvas of blankness before him as he painted our backyard with all of the flowers that mom had planted - even the ones that took up space in our window boxes during the summertime; they were always blooming and it seemed as if there were so many of them that they would never go away. I never understood why he was painting those flowers; they were everywhere and didn't really need to be on paper.But my uncle wanted to keep them alive, so maybe that's why he painted them.I looked at his canvas, realizing then that it all made sense - I couldn't understand why a soldier would want to keep flowers alive when there were lots of them outside already, but now I understood everything about what it meant to paint: you paint for yourself because it makes you happy, not for anyone else or for any reason at all; you just do it because you love the feeling of holding a brush and mixing together pretty colors on a blank canvas... how could you not want to do that?I finally understood my mother's paintings enough so I could tell her about my uncle's paintings after she asked me about one of them hanging in our living room - a colorful painting of a tree with little birds resting on some of its branches - and my eyes glimmered with tears as I explained to her, ""Mommy... he's not alive anymore.""My mother stopped moving around the kitchen and turned around, listening, waiting for me to finish. ""And?"" she said, sensing that there was more coming, knowing me well enough to know when I was finished telling my story.I felt the tears begin to fall and wiped them away with the back of my hand. My mother hugged me then and we cried together until she asked again if there was anything else that I wanted to tell her; she could tell there was something in me that wanted to be said but wasn't ready yet.""Hmm..."" I said, thinking about it for a few seconds before reaching into one of my pockets and pulling out some long strands of hair that were wrapped around a small rock.""It's Mommy's hair,"" I told her, giving the rock a squeeze before embracing her again.In the next chapter: Chapter 5- from Shannon’s perspective-----------------------------I liked how everything seemed so familiar; it made me feel like I had been here once before.But this was a new place for me - a place far from home where I had never been before. I couldn't remember ever being here before, so it was a little strange for me to feel this way. It was as if my mind was in two places at once; one of them, the familiar one, being home, and the other one being here, where I didn't know anyone and didn't belong to anyone.But it wasn't entirely strange to me either because I felt like this place was meant for me, like this place and all of its people could be my home if I wanted it to be.I had found my purpose that day in English class when we read our pieces aloud as a class - Stephen's piece hadn't changed much since we first read it aloud together; only a few lines were added that seemed to fit together with his words better than they did in the beginning. He had made his piece more than just an essay about writing and about how he thought about writing all the time; he added new lines that showed what he felt about writing now - how he saw writing as an opportunity for him to create something from nothing and make others happy with his work.When Steven finished reading his piece aloud again, Mr. Wilson looked around at all of us and then said, ""Well, guys, what do you think about Steven's piece now that he's rewritten it?""Carmen raised her hand and said that she still found it boring and stupid.Richard sent his paper from last week flying through the air toward Mr. Wilson and yelled, ""Man, I can't believe you gave me an F on this! This is total crap!""Mr. Wilson took Steven's paper to the front of the room so everyone could see it and then said, ""I really like this piece a lot more now that he has re-written it; let me know what you think.""We all started talking at once after that; everyone had something to say about Steven's piece. Some people were praising him for improving his work while others were saying that they liked his new piece just as much or even better than the old one.""The beginning seems very good to me,"" Carlos told him. ""It made me want to read more.""What a bunch of hypocrites we were being - it seemed like when we didn't like something we didn't have anything nice to say about it; but when someone did something great, we all ran over there as fast as we could to compliment them on their work. Maybe I was being a hypocrite too because I hated",0
Natalie goes to the police and helps them apprehend Trevor Lockwood before he can hurt anyone else .,"that month, Trevor Lockwood cleared his throat and changed the subject. “So, um, since we have our business out of the way…”<br><br>“You don’t have to worry about my rent anymore!” Natalie said, excited that another problem had been solved. She moved her legs around and leaned closer to Trevor Lockwood so that their shoulders were touching. She looked up at him with a coy smile.<br><br>The police station was located just a few blocks from Trevor Lockwood’s apartment building. The ride in the back of the squad car was short and when they arrived, Natalie was escorted into an interrogation room with a camera above the one-way mirror.<br><br>Natalie sat down on a small chair and looked over at the Detectives sitting across from her. Detectives Johnson and Lassiter of the Seattle Police Department. <br><br>“So, why don’t you tell us what happened?” Detective Johnson asked.<br><br>“I went to meet Trevor Lockwood at his apartment, but it was obvious that something was off about him. He wouldn’t stop staring at my chest and it kinda creeped me out.”<br><br>“Didn’t you report this already? Why are you telling us again?” Detective Lassiter asked.<br><br>Natalie was about to reply when the room filled with a familiar scent. The smell of coffee and bacon, her favorite combination for breakfast.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood walked in and set a plate of food down on the table in front of her.<br><br>“For the love of God, Trevor Lockwood! What do you want from me?”<br><br>Trevor moved closer to her and whispered in her ear. <br><br>“I want you, Natalie Harper.”<br><br>Natalie stood up and pushed him away. The detectives looked over at the two of them before they were startled by a loud banging on the door. They all turned around to see who was there, only to find Trevor standing outside with a knife in his hand.<br><br>“I have your money now, Natalie Harper, and I’m not afraid to use it.”<br><br>Detective Johnson took out his gun and pointed it at Trevor Lockwood. He shook his head in disbelief as he continued to point the gun at him.<br><br>“You can’t come in here with that knife, you crazy son of a bitch! Get out of here or I’ll shoot!”<br><br>Detective Lassiter moved between the two of them and tried to calm them down.<br><br>“Put the gun down, Detective Johnson! We don’t want to escalate this situation any further than it already is! If we take this any further, we could all be in danger. We need to figure out how to diffuse it first. Do you have a warrant?”<br><br>Detective Johnson shook his head.<br><br>“I don’t have a warrant but I do have probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. I’m here to arrest an individual for attempted murder.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter took them into the main police station. They sat down at a long table and Detective Johnson ordered everyone, including the secretaries and other detectives, to leave the room.<br><br>“Now, Detective Johnson, tell me what happened? Who did you come here to arrest? Did this person do something wrong?”<br><br>Detective Lassiter looked at the two policemen in front of him, waiting for one of them to speak up. One of them spoke first.<br><br>“Yes, we have a warrant out for a man named Trevor Lockwood. We think he may be responsible for the disappearance of five young women.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter did a quick internet search on his phone and then sat back in his chair.<br><br>“Wait, this is the same man that you came here to arrest? The one that just arrived here as well? The one who came here to… what exactly did you  say he was here to do? Did he come here to talk with you about something?”<br><br>Detective Johnson opened the folder with documentation for Trevor Lockwood. He handed it across the table to Detective Lassiter.<br><br>“His records indicate that he came here to speak with our witness, so we could arrest him.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter flipped through a few pages and then looked up at the two policemen.<br><br>“Wait, this says here that he is a serial killer?”<br><br>Detective Johnson nodded.<br><br>“That is correct. He has lured five young women to their deaths in the past three years. We believe he tried to lure our witness here today, but that she refused to go with him and instead came here to the police station where we were able to apprehend him.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter continued flipping through pages of paperwork before standing up.<br><br>“Where is this man now? We need to move fast to make an arrest.”<br><br>The two detectives explained that he was in a holding cell in the courthouse. Detective Lassiter left to make arrangements.<br><br>Detective Johnson looked down at the file on his lap and then back up at me.<br><br>“Are you ready to move forward with your statement?”<br><br>I nodded. “Yes, of course! I just need a few minutes though, if that’s okay with you.”<br><br>The two detectives agreed. I exited the room and moved to the side staircase and began climbing. When I reached the fourth floor, I entered an empty courtroom and sat down in front of the large window that overlooked Main Street. It was quiet and peaceful here, but it wouldn’t be for long. I moved to the front of the room and took a seat at the witness stand.<br><br>The courtroom door opened and Detective Johnson walked in. He closed the door behind him and turned to face me as he walked toward the witness stand.<br><br>“No problem, I understand that you just  went through something very traumatic. Take all the time you need to compose yourself. We can keep this quick and easy if you like, or we can take our time…whatever works for you.”<br><br>“It would be good to get this over with so I can begin putting my life back together.”<br><br>Detective Johnson nodded and then walked over to a wooden chair sitting directly in front of the witness stand. He sat down and then paused for a moment before speaking.<br><br>“I have a few questions I need to ask you that will help us move forward, but first I need you to meet someone.”<br><br>“Okay, who is it?”<br><br>Detective Johnson reached into his pocket and removed a piece of paper from inside his wallet. After unfolding the paper he handed it to me, and then moved closer to me.<br><br>“This is a picture of Trevor Lockwood,” he said as he pointed at the photograph. “This man is wanted by the police for multiple counts of kidnapping and murder. According to your statement, you are the latest in a long list of women who went missing under similar circumstances.”<br><br>He moved back to the wooden chair and placed his hands behind his head.<br><br>“The details of the crimes vary in each case, but they all follow the same pattern: The women agreed to meet a handsome man on a certain date after speaking with him online, but when they arrive at the location given by the man they were never heard from again. We have five instances where this exact scenario took place, and in all cases the women went to that location, but never came back.”<br><br>The detective moved closer to me, then continued talking.<br><br>“Lockwood would go to the location where the transactions were supposed to take place, but when a woman arrived there he would either move the location or have one of his accomplices do it. In all cases, no trace of any of these women was ever found again. We have gone to the locations Lockwood has been listed at, but all traces of him were long gone.”<br><br>He moved back to the chair and straightened his tie.<br><br>“The reason why we moved so quickly in this instance is that one of our informers said that Lockwood had been planning to lure yet another woman to her death, and that he had been bragging about it online. We were able to track him down and arrest him before he could carry out his plan.”<br><br>The detective paused for a moment, then looked at me.<br><br>“So, you see, Miss Harper, you are very lucky to be alive.”<br><br>I nodded in understanding, then asked the question that had been on my mind since I had first heard about this case.<br><br>“Detective, why do you think Trevor Lockwood did this?”<br><br>The detective leaned back in his chair and sighed.<br><br>“That, Miss Harper, is something that we may never know for sure. But I have my theories.”",1
Julia Martin starts to experience terrifying visions.,"Julia Martin lay in her bed. She was trying to calm down and slow her breathing. The images in her head were becoming clearer and clearer. She could see the townspeople as they walked about in their normal routine, going about their business. They looked pretty normal, but they were missing something that Julia couldn’t put her finger on, but she knew that she would know it when she saw.<br><br>She could see people walking by the grocery store, and suddenly a strange aura appeared around the door of the store. The aura was a very bright white light, and Julia found herself feeling afraid for no apparent reason. Julia started to feel a sense of dread, and she didn’t understand why. Her eyes started to tear up, and a lump formed in her throat. She felt scared, and she felt like she had to run away. She ran as fast as she could away from the grocery store, but  still she felt like something was coming after her.<br><br>The light from the grocery store seemed to follow Julia wherever she ran, always remaining just out of reach. The townspeople now seemed to be changing in Julia’s vision. She could see that they had begun a process of degeneration. The people around her were becoming more and more strange.<br><br>They were losing their bodies, and now they were nothing but gray masses, moving about the streets in a ghostly fashion. No longer did they have any discernible faces or bodies; all that she could see was a mass of moving gray clouds. They moved among the stores like a cloud of smoke, occasionally forming into a face or an animal and then dissipating again.<br><br>They seemed to be looking straight at Julia, but she couldn’t quite tell if they were even aware of her. They were moving in a very strange manner, with no apparent destination in mind. They glided from the streets into people’s homes and back again, making no sense whatsoever. Now the townspeople were trying to enter her own home.<br><br>As soon as they entered, they vanished, leaving behind only gray ash on the floor. She tried to close her eyes so that she might not be forced to look upon these bizarre ghosts, but she found that she was unable to.<br><br>She opened them again, and found herself staring at the entrance to her own home. In front of her was a young man with no face or body, who seemed to be holding an arm outstretched towards her. It was as if he were beckoning her to follow him, but there was nothing she could do. She had no legs with which to move, only a cloud of moving gray ash. Still, it appeared that whatever he was beckoning her to follow him into had a definite destination in mind; it wasn’t just wandering aimlessly through people’s homes.<br><br>More and more of these silhouettes started to appear before her. For some reason she did not question this occurrence; it was as if she had come to accept the fact that these ghosts would be coming into her house. They entered from every  side, and though they had no feet they were able to make their way through the floor as if it were water. They seemed to want not only to enter her house, but also to remain inside.<br><br>She could see them clearly now, because they had all taken on the gray color of her home. She saw that they were all people she knew in one form or another, and many of them had faces that had been torn apart or sliced off, a terrible sight. They didn’t seem to be aware of that, though; they simply stood there waiting for her to follow them into her home. She knew that she had to do it.<br><br>She was led into the living room, and saw that her house had been invaded by these gray silhouettes. At first she thought that they were looking at her, but then realized that they were all looking past her towards a house at the end of the street where a woman lived with her two children. The silhouettes were coming forward in a line, and they began to move towards the woman’s house.<br><br>Thelma Bates was now standing in front of Julia, and she was pointing to the house down the street. She could see the silhouette of Thelma become more distinct in the gray cloud that surrounded them both.<br><br>“That’s where it all starts to go awry. That’s where it begins, and then before you know it, the visions are everywhere. Each one more terrible than the last.” <br><br>Thelma began to walk down the street towards the woman with her two children. Julia wanted to go and warn her, but she was unable to move from where she was standing. She tried to call out, but could not force any sounds out of her mouth. She could see Thelma walking slowly down the street with the other silhouettes in her wake. When Thelma reached the woman’s house, she gestured for Julia to follow her. This time, Julia was able to make sounds, and she began to yell at Thelma, “What are you doing?”<br><br>“We have to show them what’s going on. We can’t let them enter that house without knowing what they are getting into,” Thelma said as she turned to Julia.<br><br>Julia continued to yell, “But they will get hurt! And so will you!”<br><br>As much as Julia wanted to stop what was happening, she could not muster up the strength to move. She tried again to yell and move her body, but both were still impossible. She heard a door open and then the sound of footsteps on the floor of the house. The figure of the woman appeared at the window and began to stare at Julia and Thelma. She stared with such fright that it frightened Julia even more.<br><br>The figure of the woman slowly turned away from the window, but she did not enter the room. Instead, she raised her hand and began to hit herself in the face over and over again.<br><br>Julia tried to yell louder, but she was still entirely incapable of moving. She was glad that Tim was in the house with them, but he was too far away for her to call out loud enough for him to hear. She wanted to scream so that he would help her, but she was mute. Thelma had jumped back and was waving to get Tim’s attention, but he did not seem to notice.<br><br>Finally, Julia made the effort to step forward even though it hurt and pulled Thelma with her. She called out to Tim and finally he turned around. It looked like Thelma was holding his left arm and Julia was holding his right. He stopped and stared at them, unable to believe what they were doing.<br><br>“Don’t come in here!” Thelma yelled at him",1
Jennifer decides to leave her family and start a new life.,".""<br><br>She said in an almost happy tone as she looked at him from the corner of her eye before getting off of her bed and walking towards the door. When she opened it, she saw Eric sitting on the couch with his phone in his hands, looking like he had been waiting for her to wake up.<br><br>""Good Morning."" he said with a small smile on his face as Jennifer closed the door behind her before walking towards him with a sigh. ""What's wrong? ""he asked, glancing up at her before looking back down at the screen of his phone again. He was reading an article about something that could help him get over this whole mess between them since he didn't trust himself when it came to talking or even trying to approach Jennifer about what happened between them yesterday.<br><br>""Nothing is wrong."" Jennifer replied back with a small shrug of her shoulders before walking into the kitchen to make herself some breakfast. She was hungry and she needed something to eat since the doctor told her that she needed to take good care of herself while pregnant because then James would be strong as well.She sat down on a chair before opening the package containing the crackers and taking one out with a sigh of relief. The whole situation was really starting to get to her and she wished that she could just curl up into a ball and hide from the world for a while until it all went away. But how could she do that when Eric was still sitting in the living room with no intention of doing anything else? There was no way for her to get any peace and quiet in this house unless she chose to leave them alone.She sighed as she thought about the plan that was running through her head, deciding if it was really worth it to go with it or not. She knew that doing what she wanted wouldn't be something good at all because she would have to make Eric hate her even more before going ahead with it, but what other choice did they have? They couldn't go on like this every day when they are simply pretending like nothing is wrong between them, right? She took another bite of her cracker before grabbing her glass of water and drinking some of it before looking up at Eric again.""Are you going to talk about what happened yesterday?"" asked Jennifer in a soft voice as Eric looked up at her for a moment before shaking his head slowly.""No."" he said in a small voice, glancing up at Jennifer once more before looking back down at his phone once again. ""We've been through this before and I don't want to get into it again just so you can feel better, Jennifer."" he said, raising his hands in front of him as he sighed. ""I'm sorry... But I'm not going to do that.""Jennifer looked down at the ground for a moment before nodding her head slowly.""Alright then."" she said in a soft voice, getting off of her chair before walking towards the door leading outside. She stopped for a moment before turning around and looking at Eric again. ""I'm going for a walk over there.."" she said in a shy voice, pointing at the back door that led to the backyard with a small smile on her face because she knew that she was punishing them both this way by making them spend more time together when they didn't want to be together anymore. ""Please stay here... I won't be long.""Eric looked up at her before sighing deeply as he closed his phone and put it down on the armrest of the couch. He saw how nervous Jennifer was acting and wondered what she was going to do out there when she left the house like this. Was she planning on running away from home? He shook his head slowly as he thought about that possibility while getting off of the couch and following after her.He got outside, seeing Jennifer walking towards the side of the house. She could feel Eric following after her and she knew that she would have to move fast if he wanted to stop her from doing what she planned on doing. She didn't want him to know that she was running away from home because how would it look if everything was going well and then suddenly, she disappears? She didn't want that, of course... But it looked like Eric wasn't about to let this go so she had no choice but to do something about it herself.""Jennifer..."" called Eric in a small voice as he watched her walk into the backyard and close the door behind herself before stopping in the middle of the yard, looking up at the sky before taking a deep breath. ""What are you doing?""""I'm going for a walk."" Jennifer replied back with a shrug of her shoulders while looking down at her feet before taking another deep breath.""Alright then.. You can go for a walk but don't go too far away, okay? You'll get lost and I don't want that happening to you."" he said in an encouraging voice as Jennifer looked up at him with wide eyes.""I won't get lost."" she said in a soft voice before sighing deeply as Eric nodded his head at her words and she walked away from him before he could say anything else. She walked around the house, heading towards the forest nearby, checking over her shoulder every now and then to see if Eric was following after her. She didn't want him to get in her way or stop her from doing what she planned on doing because she needed to focus on just getting out of their lives as soon as possible.She finally got to the edge of the forest and she walked into it with a sigh of relief while looking around at everything that was in front of her. This place gave her the comfort that she had been looking for over these past few months. She knew that this was where she belonged. She didn't belong with Eric anymore... She had never belonged with him if she were being honest with herself because once upon a time he had been the guy who made her life worth living, but now? Now he was making her life miserable by making them go through this awkward relationship. They were fake to each other and they hated each other's guts but they couldn't just get a divorce because that would be too messy for them both instead of something simple like taking a leave of absence from work or something along those lines because they were both working together at two different companies",0
Mary Smith walks home from work and becomes the victim of a mugging attempt by John Doe.,"<br><br>Mary walked home from her job at the local bank. The journey was a long one, since her office was near the outer edge of the city and she lived in the center of town. She was glad that the weather was good enough to walk home, although the walk could get a bit strenuous on some days, depending on traffic and other conditions.<br><br>So engrossed was Mary in her thoughts that she did not look up, even though she had heard footsteps approaching behind her. It was only when she heard someone call out for her to stop that she turned around and saw a man running out of an alley towards her.<br><br>“Halt!” he shouted. Her mind raced as she tried to think up ways to escape this man who had presumably just robbed someone else in this area. She started walking faster and tried walking down another street that looked like it led back towards town but there were no cars or pedestrians around now so this didn’t seem like a sound plan either. The mugger started running towards Mary, calling for her to stop again but his words were becoming increasingly strangled as he sprinted nearer and nearer to Mary.<br><br>Mary stopped running when he called out for the third time and turned around to face him. The man was still panting from the exertion of running but regained his breath quickly, glaring at Mary with a look that made her want to run and hide.<br><br>“Stupid bitch,” the man muttered and made a lunge towards Mary, grabbing her arm tightly enough so that she knew she would have bruises there in a few days. He dragged her into an alley and into some bushes where no one would be able to see them. “Now hand over all your valuables. If you don’t comply, I can easily harm you, missy.”<br><br>Mary handed over her purse and proceeded to take off her ring as well but did not hand it over yet. She hoped she could use this opportunity to escape from this situation without any harm being done. As the mugger took Mary’s handbag, he noticed he was shaking; he was nervous about taking this woman’s money or possessions for fear of being caught by the police for assaulting someone else on their way home from work or school or wherever it was they were coming from that day. He had been mugging people for years now but along came this girl who changed everything he thought about robbery. He didn’t know why, but he felt a strange connection to her; as if something was drawing him towards her.<br><br>As the mugger walked towards Mary to take her ring, she grabbed her purse and made a run for it. The mugger stepped out of the bushes just in time to see Mary running off, clutching onto the purse he had been about to steal from her. “Wait!” he called out with all his might.<br><br>Mary didn’t stop running until she was almost home and then she ran up the stairs and banged on the door of her flat. Patrick opened the door and smiled when he saw that it was Mary who had barged in on them unannounced. “Hi Mary, what are you doing back so early today?”<br><br>Mary started panting as she tried to catch her breath enough to answer Patrick’s question. “Someone tried to rob me and I ran away, oh God I still can’t breathe properly.” A few moments later, Mary finally managed to say more than one sentence at a time but only just barely. “I think I need some mints or something because my breath stinks! Do you have any?”<br><br>Patrick laughed. “You know that’s the least of your problems right?”<br><br>Mary shook her head. “No, don’t ask me questions like that, Pat. You scare me when you talk about things like that. My day was already bad enough, I don’t want to think about what would happen if you mention anything worse happening to me today!” Mary took a few more deep breaths before she went on with her story. “I was walking home from work today and some guy tried to rob me so I ran away and he chased after me but he didn’t catch me so all is well…I guess.”<br><br>Patrick smiled before stepping out of the door and locking it behind him as he walked out into the hall. “Well then, I think you should tell your story to someone who can actually do something about this mugging problem. After all, our neighbour is a cop and the department to report these things happens to be across from him so why don’t we walk over there now? He might even want to come help us investigate the area where it happened then we can try finding that mugger and find out why he was so desperate to steal from you.”<br><br>Mary folded her arms in front of her. “But I don’t want to go to the police with this, Pat. That would be a waste of their time and mine because it won’t happen again. Besides, I don’t think that guy will come back here again after seeing that I live here with other people who can protect me from him from now on. So really, there is no need for me to make a report or go anywhere else for that matter. This is it; case closed, end of story!”<br><br>Patrick shook his head but smiled at the same time while gripping onto Mary’s shoulder tightly before saying one more thing he wanted her to hear very clearly. “Well then, maybe if you don’t realise what an important part of the police force you are by reporting things like that to our neighbours then maybe we won’t be such good neighbours anymore? Maybe you should find some new ones and leave us behind? Don’t worry though; we will always have a place in your heart because your first kiss was right here! ”<br><br>Mary bl",0
Shannon's paintings help her to deal with her grief and to find a new sense of purpose.,"who would spend too much time thinking about things,"" I told Steven; ""and what he does or doesn't think about can't be that important if he's willing to leave me alone.""""What's wrong with you?"" Steven asked me; ""I don't understand why you think of yourself as so much better than everyone else.""""I don't think of myself as better,"" I said but I'm not sure that Steven heard me because he was talking again.""Cal's helpful, you know,"" Steven said; ""the teachers like him and the younger kids like him too - there's even a rumor going around that Cal doesn't really have a father but there's no proof that it's true. If it is true though, then it kind of explains why Cal is the way he is - maybe his father left him and his mother died when he was young and then his grandfather threw him out on the streets or something. Either that or his father gave him this asshole attitude to rebel against or something like that.""I didn't want to hear anything about Cal now so I twisted my head away from Steven - I was actually shivering now, even though it wasn't very cold outside. The wind was blowing on my face and making me feel cold but I couldn't stop shivering even though I was trying to calm myself down.""What's wrong with you?"" Steven asked me; ""why are you so upset? Did something happen?""I kind of laughed and then I shook my head; I didn't know what to say and besides, I didn't want to say anything.""I'm sorry,"" he said and he grabbed my hand. ""Did Cal do something to you? Did he tell you something bad about your mother or maybe about me?""""How could you possibly know what Cal would tell me - it's not like we're friends or anything,"" I told him.""Cal is a real asshole towards everyone,"" Steven said, ""he deserves it if the teachers don't like him. He treats everyone like shit and he doesn't care about anyone but himself.""""I wonder why he isn't in jail then,"" I said. ""It sounds like that's where someone like him would be if all the teachers really thought that way.""""No one really knows why Cal isn't in jail - there was this one time when they caught Cal stealing money from his teacher's desk,"" Steven told me; ""it was only twenty dollars so they could have just overlooked it but instead, they let Cal go with a warning just because of everything that had happened in the past. They said that the principal didn't think someone like Cal needed to be sent to jail just because of something like that. Everyone was worried about Cal though, especially his uncle - he said that they should have thrown Cal in jail and then he punched the principal in the face.""""Did they send Cal to jail then?"" I asked.""No,"" Steven told me; ""they just told him not to do it again and then they pretty much let it go at that. It was a lot of hard work for everyone but they all decided it was better than throwing Cal in jail just because of some petty crime.""I nodded my head; I could understand why everyone would want to leave Cal alone instead of throwing him in jail - after all, nobody really deserved to be sent to prison for stealing twenty dollars - but I still thought there must have been some other way for them to correct the situation without simply letting him off with a warning - what if he'd really been stealing thousands and thousands of dollars? How could anyone possibly allow something like that?""I'm out of here,"" Steven said suddenly and he got up from his seat; ""did you hear me? I'm not going back home tonight - I'll sleep somewhere around here.""I stood up too (my legs felt a bit weak) and I looked at Steven; I kind of wondered why he was being so stubborn about this but then I realized that this was his way of coping with the situation (or something like that). He wasn't going to just accept his mother's death and move on - why would anyone move on from something like that? It was impossible.""Are you sure it's a good idea to sleep around here?"" I asked Steven. ""Cal is out there doing God knows what - and if he finds you, what do you think he'll do to you?""""Cal won't find me,"" Steven said confidently. ""He doesn't even know where we went today - and even if he did know, it wouldn't matter because he wouldn't be able to find me.""I had the strangest feeling that Cal would be able to find us no matter where we went, no matter how well we hid ourselves but of course, there was no point in saying anything about that now.""Okay,"" I said blankly; ""good luck then.""I started walking towards my car - Dad had dropped me off earlier so that meant it was only about two minutes drive from here to my house.""Eve!"" Steven called after me.I turned around and looked at him. He was standing there, just like before, staring at me with those same intense eyes that seemed to pierce through my heart.""Don't forget about me, okay?"" Steven said. ""You're the only one who's ever understood me - you're the only one that's ever listened to me and seen past all of this.""""I won't forget about you,"" I told him. ""I promise.""""I'll find you when I'm ready,"" Steven said; ""and then we'll get out of here - I want to experience a life outside of this town.""""I'd like that,"" I told him. ""Write to me or call me or something - let me know what happens...""""Alright,"" Steven said; and then he turned around and walked off into the darkness of night...I had barely driven away from the curb before I started crying again. As soon as I was on my own, away from everyone else (especially Cal), I couldn't help but start crying again; but unlike all those other times when Cal wasn't around, this time was different because someone else was watching over me...It had been almost two hours since Dad picked us up from school.

Julia Martin starts to experience terrifying visions.,"Julia Martin lay in her bed. She was trying to calm down and slow her breathing. The images in her head were becoming clearer and clearer. She could see the townspeople as they walked about in their normal routine, going about their business. They looked pretty normal, but they were missing something that Julia couldn’t put her finger on, but she knew that she would know it when she saw.<br><br>She could see people walking by the grocery store, and suddenly a strange aura appeared around the door of the store. The aura was a very bright white light, and Julia found herself feeling afraid for no apparent reason. Julia started to feel a sense of dread, and she didn’t understand why. Her eyes started to tear up, and a lump formed in her throat. She felt scared, and she felt like she had to run away. She ran as fast as she could away from the grocery store, but  still she felt like something was coming after her.<br><br>The light from the grocery store seemed to follow Julia wherever she ran, always remaining just out of reach. The townspeople now seemed to be changing in Julia’s vision. She could see that they had begun a process of degeneration. The people around her were becoming more and more strange.<br><br>They were losing their bodies, and now they were nothing but gray masses, moving about the streets in a ghostly fashion. No longer did they have any discernible faces or bodies; all that she could see was a mass of moving gray clouds. They moved among the stores like a cloud of smoke, occasionally forming into a face or an animal and then dissipating again.<br><br>They seemed to be looking straight at Julia, but she couldn’t quite tell if they were even aware of her. They were moving in a very strange manner, with no apparent destination in mind. They glided from the streets into people’s homes and back again, making no sense whatsoever. Now the townspeople were trying to enter her own home.<br><br>As soon as they entered, they vanished, leaving behind only gray ash on the floor. She tried to close her eyes so that she might not be forced to look upon these bizarre ghosts, but she found that she was unable to.<br><br>She opened them again, and found herself staring at the entrance to her own home. In front of her was a young man with no face or body, who seemed to be holding an arm outstretched towards her. It was as if he were beckoning her to follow him, but there was nothing she could do. She had no legs with which to move, only a cloud of moving gray ash. Still, it appeared that whatever he was beckoning her to follow him into had a definite destination in mind; it wasn’t just wandering aimlessly through people’s homes.<br><br>More and more of these silhouettes started to appear before her. For some reason she did not question this occurrence; it was as if she had come to accept the fact that these ghosts would be coming into her house. They entered from every  side, and though they had no feet they were able to make their way through the floor as if it were water. They seemed to want not only to enter her house, but also to remain inside.<br><br>She could see them clearly now, because they had all taken on the gray color of her home. She saw that they were all people she knew in one form or another, and many of them had faces that had been torn apart or sliced off, a terrible sight. They didn’t seem to be aware of that, though; they simply stood there waiting for her to follow them into her home. She knew that she had to do it.<br><br>She was led into the living room, and saw that her house had been invaded by these gray silhouettes. At first she thought that they were looking at her, but then realized that they were all looking past her towards a house at the end of the street where a woman lived with her two children. The silhouettes were coming forward in a line, and they began to move towards the woman’s house.<br><br>Thelma Bates was now standing in front of Julia, and she was pointing to the house down the street. She could see the silhouette of Thelma become more distinct in the gray cloud that surrounded them both.<br><br>“That’s where it all starts to go awry. That’s where it begins, and then before you know it, the visions are everywhere. Each one more terrible than the last.” <br><br>Thelma began to walk down the street towards the woman with her two children. Julia wanted to go and warn her, but she was unable to move from where she was standing. She tried to call out, but could not force any sounds out of her mouth. She could see Thelma walking slowly down the street with the other silhouettes in her wake. When Thelma reached the woman’s house, she gestured for Julia to follow her. This time, Julia was able to make sounds, and she began to yell at Thelma, “What are you doing?”<br><br>“We have to show them what’s going on. We can’t let them enter that house without knowing what they are getting into,” Thelma said as she turned to Julia.<br><br>Julia continued to yell, “But they will get hurt! And so will you!”<br><br>As much as Julia wanted to stop what was happening, she could not muster up the strength to move. She tried again to yell and move her body, but both were still impossible. She heard a door open and then the sound of footsteps on the floor of the house. The figure of the woman appeared at the window and began to stare at Julia and Thelma. She stared with such fright that it frightened Julia even more.<br><br>The figure of the woman slowly turned away from the window, but she did not enter the room. Instead, she raised her hand and began to hit herself in the face over and over again.<br><br>Julia tried to yell louder, but she was still entirely incapable of moving. She was glad that Tim was in the house with them, but he was too far away for her to call out loud enough for him to hear. She wanted to scream so that he would help her, but she was mute. Thelma had jumped back and was waving to get Tim’s attention, but he did not seem to notice.<br><br>Finally, Julia made the effort to step forward even though it hurt and pulled Thelma with her. She called out to Tim and finally he turned around. It looked like Thelma was holding his left arm and Julia was holding his right. He stopped and stared at them, unable to believe what they were doing.<br><br>“Don’t come in here!” Thelma yelled at him",1

"Mary Smith, George Smith, Jessica Doe, and John Doe all give testimony in court and John Doe is ultimately convicted and sent to prison.","to the bottom of this soon before it becomes a bigger problem.”<br><br>Patrick nodded his head in agreement before saying, “I was thinking about going over to Alfa's bar; do you want to come with me?”<br><br>James smiled and answered, “Of course…it's like old times again with you back in our lives Mary.”<br><br>Patrick couldn't help but laugh at his brother as they headed over to the bar together; things had seemed so bleak in their lives not too long ago but now it seemed that everything was finally turning around for the better for them.<br><br>Chapter 4 – The Big Fight<br><br>Once the officers had left the alleyway, Mary stood there for a moment staring down at her hands which were trembling from the excitement of what had just happened. She had barely been able to believe her eyes when she realized that they were shaking and she wondered if there was something wrong with her or if perhaps just being around Patrick was enough to make any woman's hands shake out of excitement. She let out a long deep breath as she tried to clear her head; things were going too well right now and it would be foolish of her not to take advantage of this chance that she had been given.<br><br>“I really can't believe that it happened just like that; I wasn't even able to realize what was happening until it was over with and I couldn't believe how easily I tricked him.”<br><br>Mary smiled as she thought about how easy it had seemed when she first started this plan; the hardest part of it all was trying to get Patrick to not want her anymore, but once she had gotten past that hurdle then everything else seemed to be falling into place all on its own. She suddenly realized that she was breathing a bit heavily from being so nervous and she sat down on the ground in front of the fence and tried to calm herself down. It was obvious that she needed something more than just a few minutes to relax, but instead of turning to drugs or alcohol like countless other people did, Mary turned her thoughts towards one thing that always made her feel completely relaxed: her husband. She closed her eyes tightly and let out a low long moan as she thought back on their time together; the way he would smile when they first met at the park, how he would touch and caress her body until she couldn't think straight anymore…it all made her heart race with excitement again as if it were all happening all over again. Mary kept her eyes closed tightly as she let her mind wander and she thought back to all of their first dates and even the first time that they had ever slept together.<br><br>Mary let out a sharp gasp of air as she suddenly remembered the way that he had taken her virginity; there was a sharp pain in her heart when she realized that he hadn't even been aware that it was her first time. She had always been a virgin for many reasons, but the most important reason being because she wanted to give herself to someone special who would cherish it and treat it as something special because of how much it meant to her. The only thing that seemed more painful than realizing that Patrick never saw anything special about their night together was the fact that he had rather callously left her life without saying goodbye or doing anything special for her; he didn't even take care of any protection before arriving at his house late one night…she knew very well what could have happened if she had become pregnant with his baby and she shuddered at the thought of how different things might be right now if she had gotten pregnant with his child.<br><br>It didn't take long before Mary began to cry, though this time they were tears of frustration rather than pain. She had worked so hard to get back on her feet after the divorce and she had finally gotten her life together and everything was finally going so well…she couldn't allow Patrick to ruin this for her or she would be right back where she started. She knew that he was probably a scumbag who didn't care about anyone but himself, but even a scumbag could have a change of heart and if he saw that Mary was no longer in his life then maybe it would make him feel bad enough to come back into hers. Mary shook her head as she wiped the tears from underneath her eyes; there was no way that Patrick would ever feel anything for her again and whatever he felt for her before had likely been nothing more than some stupid love spell that time had broken.<br><br>Patrick did have magic powers, Mary thought to herself, which was the only reason why she could understand why he might have fallen in love with me…but what use are those powers if they can't make him stop being such an asshole?<br><br>For a moment Elizabeth breathed deeply as she tried to get herself together; even though it seemed silly to think back on all of this when it had happened so long ago, it also felt like yesterday as well. She knew that she was being dramatic, but she also knew that if Patrick somehow heard about this then he would be the one to blame for it. Even though it wasn't specifically his fault that he left her without saying goodbye, it was his fault for acting like such a jerk after their night together and if he could change things then she was sure that he would…but then again, if he really cared about her then wouldn't he have recognized his mistakes before things got to this point?<br><br>Elizabeth turned her thoughts toward something else when her phone suddenly began to vibrate in her pocket; having had a pretty bad day in general so far, she hoped that any call from Justin would cheer her up and give her something else to focus on s0he reached into her pocket and answered the phone happily.<br><br>""Hey Justin, what's up?"" Elizabeth asked as she wiped a stray tear from underneath one of her eyes.<br><br>""Oh hey Lizzy…what's wrong?"" Justin asked softly. ""I can tell you're upset…""<br><br>""It's nothing,"" Elizabeth responded with a sigh. ""My day has just been pretty awful so far…but I'm sure it'll get better soon."" She paused for a moment as",0

He pushed the small cotton fabric aside and moved his hands underneath of them to touch her bare breasts.<br><br>Natalie Harper was moving completely out of her comfort zone by agreeing to an in-person meeting with Trevor Lockwood. She was moving further out of it as he moved his hands all over her body, especially when she  could feel his hard cock against her crotch through their clothes.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood touched the soft skin without restraint and Natalie Harper held her breath as he squeezed her large breasts in his hands. He then moved his lips to the area above one of them and kissed the tender skin there.<br><br>Natalie Harper was already feeling turned on by Trevor Lockwood and she knew that when he felt her bare breasts, his arousal would increase. She was a little surprised at how turned on she was herself, considering how nervous she felt as Trevor Lockwood was undressing her. <br><br>Trevor Lockwood parted Natalie Harper’s thighs with his hands as he began to suck on one of her large breasts. After a few seconds, Natalie felt him move closer to her and she knew what was coming next.<br><br>The part of Natalie Harper that was not turned on by this situation was kicking in as Trevor Lockwood spread her legs and buried his face between them. Natalie began to feel a little nervous about the situation. She had never let anyone do that before, not even herself.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood began to kiss the soft skin of Natalie Harper’s inner thighs and she felt her knees grow weak as he licked the area between her legs. Natalie Harper felt her nerves give way to desire as Trevor Lockwood touched her most intimate areas. She began to think about what he was doing and why, and she felt a little uncomfortable that she was so turned on by it all. Trevor Lock wood found this amusing and continued to lick Natalie Harper’s pussy.<br><br>Natalie Harper was beginning to panic as she thought about what Trevor Lockwood was doing between her legs. He had not even touched her pussy yet and she could already feel the strong sensations emanating from it. It occurred to Natalie that Trevor Lockwood might have done this before and that he might be very good at it. Natalie Harper grew more and more nervous as the minutes passed, but she could only focus on what was happening to her body.<br><br>Natalie Harper felt as if she were going crazy. She wanted to stop what was happening, but  her body told her otherwise. She knew that it was “wrong” to let a stranger do this to her and she knew that she should get up and leave, but something inside of her would not allow her to do so.<br><br>She didn’t hear from Trevor after that, and Natalie began",1
Aimee Kincaid goes home after a long day at work only to find her apartment empty and her loneliness amplified by the silence.,"<br><br>Aimee Kincaid stepped off the train and trudged through the rain, stopping every now and then to look at a storefront or listen to the people around her. The bustle of busy commuters and pedestrians was different than at home, but there was still something comforting about being in a city where millions of people had found their own way in life and were making something for themselves.<br><br>She walked down the sidewalk, coming up to a street corner that was almost like an intersection in its own right; people from all directions crisscrossed through the middle of it, stepping into shops and restaurants or down side streets. The sidewalk was crowded but flowing smoothly enough for Aimee to keep moving. She broke through the crowd going outside of a shop with a sign that said ""Bookstore"", pulling her scarf up over her head as she went inside to be out of the rain.<br><br>Inside it wasn't quite as crowded as out on the sidewalk, but there was still more than enough people around Aimee to break up her initial loneliness when she first walked into the store. She made her way over to one of the self-checkout lanes, found the book she wanted in record time and swiped it across a scanner before bagging it.<br><br>""Excuse me!"" A voice broke through the drone of activity inside the bookstore, calling Aimee's attention to a man standing at the other side of the aisle she was facing. He had his hand raised, palm up, as if he'd been trying to wave her over. ""Hello?"" His tone seemed like he wasn't expecting an answer, and that could only mean one thing: he wanted help looking for someone. ""My wife is missing.""<br><br>""I'm sorry."" Aimee turned back toward him and approached him with a long stride. ""What can I do to help?""<br><br>""I'm not sure..."" He looked back over his shoulder before turning his attention forward again, his eyes falling on a woman standing behind the magazine rack at the other end of the aisle that Aimee was standing in front of. The woman looked fairly normal but she stood out somehow, despite having a very average build and wearing very bland clothing: a dark grey skirt with knee-high boots and black tights underneath them; her tight t-shirt revealed that she wore a black bra beneath it; and a pale blue cardigan sweater that was pulled around her tightly even in this weather because it was likely to be chilled. She was holding a magazine in one hand and a stack of them in the other, as though she'd begun reading them but then decided not to before moving on to another aisle. ""Oh, there she is.""<br><br>The man moved around Aimee to get over to his wife, bursting forward in an impressive run for someone who was probably in his 60s or 70s; he overdid it just enough that Aimee laughed at him inwardly. She gave the woman beside her a smile when she looked up from her magazine, but she didn't seem to want to make eye contact with Aimee either.<br><br>""I'm sure you're more than capable of finding your wife on your own."" Aimee turned back around so that she was facing forward again and resumed walking out of the store when she noticed that everyone had started getting back into their own business. ""Just kidding!"" The woman beside her heard her say that and looked up at her with an arched eyebrow, which only made Aimee laugh even more. ""Sorry, I'm so sorry..."" When they got outside the woman was still looking at Aimee strangely and looking over her shoulder every few seconds as if expecting something bad to happen, so as soon as they were out of earshot Aimee turned to her again and spoke to her while they walked. ""Look, I'm sorry if this is insensitive but I have to ask: are you feeling like something bad is going to happen because of your husband being gone? Because that's totally normal for anyone in your situation, not just for your husband being missing.""<br><br>""Really?"" She stopped walking and turned to face Aimee, stepping toward her on the sidewalk. ""Then you should know that I have a very strong feeling that something bad is going to happen!""<br><br>""Hey! Don't be rude!"" The man emerged from the door that his wife had disappeared into as soon as she was done talking. ""Aimee's been helping me look for you for almost twenty minutes now! What is wrong with you?"" He looked at his wife again and shook his head. ""I'm sorry about this..."" He gave Aimee a sad smile before continuing. ""We're still getting used to each other again since we got back together after... Well, since we were separated for so long."" The woman began walking forward again and now the two of them were just looking at each other as they walked, so Aimee decided it was okay to continue following them.<br><br>""She thought something was going to happen?"" Aimee shook her head and scoffed. ""I'm sorry, I shouldn't have been so rude..."" She stared down at her feet as they started walking again, kicking at some of the broken glass that had littered the sidewalk since the other night. ""But I don't know why she'd feel like something bad is about to happen if you're here with her."" Her eyes drifted up to watch the man's face as he struggled to come up with an answer; what she saw surprised her and made her stop in her tracks. He was crying... This man she'd only just met today was crying because he felt like he'd failed someone because of something else that he did...? It wasn't fair!<br><br>""Listen..."" She broke out of her trance and started walking forward again, brushing past both of them without saying another word. After about ten seconds of walking though she stopped again and turned around; now she had everyone's attention and they all stopped walking as well to look at Aimee curiously. ""...If you think your wife is suicidal maybe you shouldn't leave her alone right now..."" Her words were hard to hear over the sound of a few sirens that were",0
"Melissa Jones, a witness to the robbery, calls the police and John Doe is apprehended and arrested.","you would do something about it.”<br><br>James leaned forward once again and kissed Mary on the cheek before saying to her, “You really did the right thing by calling me over to help you with this; I will call in a report and we can try to get him arrested very soon. You know how I feel about you Mary and I think that the most important thing right now is making sure that you feel safe so we can catch this guy quickly.”<br><br>Mary nodded her head as tears formed in her eyes; it was more important than anything else for her to have James' love again as soon as possible so that she could be happy. It was also very important for her to feel safe from all of the dangers in the world around them because she had been able to make herself forget about those dangers when she had been wrapped up in James' arms…which she still craved immensely now. She went over to James and gave him a hug before looking towards Patrick who was still waiting on his turn to receive a hug from Mary. He smiled at Mary before she closed her eyes and felt his arms wrap around her slender body; he smelled like spice mixed with roses…and it made Mary feel so safe just by being near him.<br><br>Patrick rejoiced in having Mary back in his arms once again and he hoped that this moment would never end; he wanted to have Mary forever and it was a dream worth holding on to. Somehow, things would work out so that they could be together in the future and he would figure out how to make that dream happen; it wouldn't be easy but nothing ever was. For now, though, Patrick just held on to Mary and enjoyed being near her; it had been so long since they had seen each other last that nothing else mattered.<br><br>After a few minutes of hugging, James broke the silence by saying to his two friends, “Well I think I am going to go call the cops now…I will see you two later okay?”<br><br>Patrick let go of Mary from his grasp before speaking again, “Yeah James I am going to head home myself so I can get some rest after spending all day here fighting off muggers…it has been a long time since we have been able to spend time like this together Mary…and I hope you remember all of the good times we had before things got complicated for us.”<br><br>Mary nodded her head and smiled at Patrick before answering him, “I'm sure that I do remember all of the good times…and I am so sorry for what happened between us. If there was anything I could do to make it up to you then I would; you didn't deserve any of the things that happened between us and it makes me feel sad when I think about how badly things ended up for us in the end.”<br><br>Patrick shook his head and pulled Mary close to him once again before saying, “It isn't your fault…and I still have some regrets of my own because I should have been more understanding towards you. You were trying to figure out who you really were while struggling to make your way in a world that can be so cruel sometimes; we both made mistakes and now we need to figure out how we can make our relationship work again...if you still want me back in your life after everything that has happened though.”<br><br>Mary wanted nothing more than to have Patrick back in her life again because she couldn't image being happy without him. She had gone into a deep depression for months after their breakup and it took her a long time before she was able to get back on track with her life; it was true that she had learned a lot from the mistakes that she had made in her relationship with Patrick and it was now a chance to do things differently.<br><br>“Of course I want you back in my life Patrick…and I will try to make things right between us this time. You are the one that I have wanted to be with ever since we first met and I love being around you; there is no one else in the world who can capture my heart the way that you can.”<br><br>Patrick smiled after he heard Mary's answer; he felt like a weight had been lifted off of his chest because there was nothing more important for him to hear than those three little words. He kissed Mary lightly on her cheek before saying, “I will see you later, James…and we will all talk about how we are going to fix everything between us later on tonight…it sounds like something good is going on over at Alfa's place so we should go celebrate there for a bit before heading home for the night.”<br><br>James couldn't help but feel proud of his brother at that moment; it was obvious that Patrick was taking this situation more seriously than anything in his life had ever been before and he hoped that things would end up working out for them by the end of the night.<br><br>“Yeah I will see you two later…and I am proud of you Patrick…I know that things didn't go the way that we thought they would but I am just glad to see you two getting back together again.”<br><br>Patrick smiled at James before saying, “I will see you later man…and thanks for always being there for me brother!”<br><br>James nodded his head before he was suddenly engulfed in Mary's arms once again; it had been so long since she had been able to hug him and she found herself wishing for things to go back the way that they used to be between them. He let go of her after a few moments and watched as she headed over towards an officer who was standing at the scene; a wild smile crossed her face as she realized that her life would soon be changing in ways that she never even imagined before.<br><br>Patrick let out a deep breath and looked over at his brother, “So what do you think about what happened tonight? It seems like a huge coincidence doesn't it?”<br><br>James nodded his head and answered, “It does seem like a bit of a coincidence; I hope that we get",1
"Paula falls in love with Sally's husband, David, and the two begin an affair.","she and Paula were back in their own car. She had driven Paula's car back to her house so that she could go home and get her car, but she needed a ride back over to the counseling office.<br><br>Paula nodded in response before turning the key in the ignition and pulling out of the parking lot of the counseling office, heading towards their homes. ""I thought you might be..."" Paula mumbled softly as they drove along.<br><br>""Do you think they'll want to hear this story?"" Sally asked suddenly, her voice wavering slightly as she placed a sheet of paper into a large envelope on her lap. ""This is my first time telling it.""<br><br>Paula nodded slowly before speaking again after some time had passed. ""Yeah... I think I'd love to hear it.""<br><br>""You wouldn't have wanted to hear about Mark then,"" Sally said quickly, but paused for a long moment as she waited for Paula to reply. ""I've been thinking about that ever since we got home from the counseling appointment...""<br><br>""Yeah... I think it might help me,"" Paula said softly as she held onto Sally's hand tightly with her right hand while keeping both hands placed at 10 and 2 on the steering wheel with her left.<br><br>""I'm not sure how much help it'll be for me,"" Sally said quietly as she watched the road ahead of them, but she didn't say anything else.<br><br>Paula nodded and smiled as they drove along, arriving at Sally's house several minutes later. She waited until Sally was out of the car and was heading inside before she pulled away from the curb and onto the road towards her own home.<br><br>She had been home for only a few minutes when she heard a knock on the front door, but she immediately walked to the door and opened it up anyway. ""Hey!""<br><br>""Are you ready to hear my story?"" Sally asked nervously as Paula opened the door and stepped aside so that Sally could walk into her home.<br><br>""Yup.""<br><br>""Alright..."" Sally said slowly after nodding once when she spoke with Paula in order to make clear that she understood what Paula was saying to her. She took a deep breath then let it out slowly before speaking again. ""I'm ready...""<br><br>Paula smiled softly as she looked at Sally in front of her, shaking slightly for reasons that Paula couldn't discern from looking at her best friend's face. ""Alright...""<br><br>""I think I'm gonna go use your bathroom real quick,"" Sally said quietly before she quickly walked into Paula's bathroom and closed the door.<br><br>Chapter 4: The Story<br><br>Two weeks after Sally had moved in with Paula, the two of them were sitting on the couch watching a movie together while eating pizza. After they finished eating their pizza, they both stretched out on her couch with their feet hanging off the edge, gently kicking each other's toes now and then as they continued to watch the movie. It was almost midnight when the movie ended, making Paula feel tired, but she didn't want to get up yet. She didn't want to leave Sally right away even though she knew that Sally would have to go home eventually. She loved having her best friend there on nights like this where they could just sit and talk or watch a movie together without anything from outside coming in to distract them from what they were doing at that moment.<br><br>""What did you get for dinner?"" Paula asked quietly as she wrapped the blanket around herself tighter so that she could become more comfortable.<br><br>Sally shrugged before replying quietly, ""An apple.""<br><br>Paula nodded slowly and smiled as she looked at Sally. ""You should probably go to sleep soon...""<br><br>""I know,"" Sally replied with a smile of her own before she slowly got up and off the couch, stretching her arms and legs out as she continued to look at Paula before speaking again. ""I'm glad I have a place to stay... Thank you for letting me stay here with you.""<br><br>""Of course,"" Paula said softly before she watched Sally walk up the stairs and into her room, closing the door behind her. She shook her head slowly as she smiled down at the blanket that she was still holding onto, sitting on the couch alone. She didn't want to be alone, so even though she felt tired enough to fall asleep right then, she reached a hand over to turn off the television that they had been watching together then walked upstairs into her bedroom.<br><br>She took a shower quickly then put on pajamas before walking across the hall into Sally's bedroom where she found Sally sitting on the floor leaning against her bed with a teddy bear in one hand, staring at the door for several minutes before Paula walked in. ""Hey...""<br><br>""Hey,"" Sally said quietly as Paula sat down next to her on the floor and wrapped an arm around Sally's shoulder. ""I think I'm going to go to sleep now... It's getting late...""<br><br>""You should go to sleep then,"" Paula said with a nod as she squeezed Sally's shoulder gently before she got up and walked back into her own room. She climbed into bed and closed her eyes as she laid on her back, bringing the blanket up over her face as she hummed quietly.<br><br>Chapter 5: The Kidnapping<br><br>Two months after Sally had moved in with Paula, the two of them had driven out of town for a camping trip for a couple of days, which was something that they did every once in a while for fun when they both felt a desire to leave their busy lives behind for a few days. In this case, it was on Saturday when they decided that it was time for one of these trips. They packed all of the things that they would need into two backpacks before driving out of town and into the woods, bringing along their sleeping bags and pillows before setting up their tent at the campsite where they planned on staying until Monday evening. After setting up their tent, they made dinner together before sitting on sleeping bags in front of the tent next to each other eating and talking",0
Natalie goes to the police and helps them apprehend Trevor Lockwood before he can hurt anyone else .,"that month, Trevor Lockwood cleared his throat and changed the subject. “So, um, since we have our business out of the way…”<br><br>“You don’t have to worry about my rent anymore!” Natalie said, excited that another problem had been solved. She moved her legs around and leaned closer to Trevor Lockwood so that their shoulders were touching. She looked up at him with a coy smile.<br><br>The police station was located just a few blocks from Trevor Lockwood’s apartment building. The ride in the back of the squad car was short and when they arrived, Natalie was escorted into an interrogation room with a camera above the one-way mirror.<br><br>Natalie sat down on a small chair and looked over at the Detectives sitting across from her. Detectives Johnson and Lassiter of the Seattle Police Department. <br><br>“So, why don’t you tell us what happened?” Detective Johnson asked.<br><br>“I went to meet Trevor Lockwood at his apartment, but it was obvious that something was off about him. He wouldn’t stop staring at my chest and it kinda creeped me out.”<br><br>“Didn’t you report this already? Why are you telling us again?” Detective Lassiter asked.<br><br>Natalie was about to reply when the room filled with a familiar scent. The smell of coffee and bacon, her favorite combination for breakfast.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood walked in and set a plate of food down on the table in front of her.<br><br>“For the love of God, Trevor Lockwood! What do you want from me?”<br><br>Trevor moved closer to her and whispered in her ear. <br><br>“I want you, Natalie Harper.”<br><br>Natalie stood up and pushed him away. The detectives looked over at the two of them before they were startled by a loud banging on the door. They all turned around to see who was there, only to find Trevor standing outside with a knife in his hand.<br><br>“I have your money now, Natalie Harper, and I’m not afraid to use it.”<br><br>Detective Johnson took out his gun and pointed it at Trevor Lockwood. He shook his head in disbelief as he continued to point the gun at him.<br><br>“You can’t come in here with that knife, you crazy son of a bitch! Get out of here or I’ll shoot!”<br><br>Detective Lassiter moved between the two of them and tried to calm them down.<br><br>“Put the gun down, Detective Johnson! We don’t want to escalate this situation any further than it already is! If we take this any further, we could all be in danger. We need to figure out how to diffuse it first. Do you have a warrant?”<br><br>Detective Johnson shook his head.<br><br>“I don’t have a warrant but I do have probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. I’m here to arrest an individual for attempted murder.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter took them into the main police station. They sat down at a long table and Detective Johnson ordered everyone, including the secretaries and other detectives, to leave the room.<br><br>“Now, Detective Johnson, tell me what happened? Who did you come here to arrest? Did this person do something wrong?”<br><br>Detective Lassiter looked at the two policemen in front of him, waiting for one of them to speak up. One of them spoke first.<br><br>“Yes, we have a warrant out for a man named Trevor Lockwood. We think he may be responsible for the disappearance of five young women.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter did a quick internet search on his phone and then sat back in his chair.<br><br>“Wait, this is the same man that you came here to arrest? The one that just arrived here as well? The one who came here to… what exactly did you  say he was here to do? Did he come here to talk with you about something?”<br><br>Detective Johnson opened the folder with documentation for Trevor Lockwood. He handed it across the table to Detective Lassiter.<br><br>“His records indicate that he came here to speak with our witness, so we could arrest him.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter flipped through a few pages and then looked up at the two policemen.<br><br>“Wait, this says here that he is a serial killer?”<br><br>Detective Johnson nodded.<br><br>“That is correct. He has lured five young women to their deaths in the past three years. We believe he tried to lure our witness here today, but that she refused to go with him and instead came here to the police station where we were able to apprehend him.”<br><br>Detective Lassiter continued flipping through pages of paperwork before standing up.<br><br>“Where is this man now? We need to move fast to make an arrest.”<br><br>The two detectives explained that he was in a holding cell in the courthouse. Detective Lassiter left to make arrangements.<br><br>Detective Johnson looked down at the file on his lap and then back up at me.<br><br>“Are you ready to move forward with your statement?”<br><br>I nodded. “Yes, of course! I just need a few minutes though, if that’s okay with you.”<br><br>The two detectives agreed. I exited the room and moved to the side staircase and began climbing. When I reached the fourth floor, I entered an empty courtroom and sat down in front of the large window that overlooked Main Street. It was quiet and peaceful here, but it wouldn’t be for long. I moved to the front of the room and took a seat at the witness stand.<br><br>The courtroom door opened and Detective Johnson walked in. He closed the door behind him and turned to face me as he walked toward the witness stand.<br><br>“No problem, I understand that you just  went through something very traumatic. Take all the time you need to compose yourself. We can keep this quick and easy if you like, or we can take our time…whatever works for you.”<br><br>“It would be good to get this over with so I can begin putting my life back together.”<br><br>Detective Johnson nodded and then walked over to a wooden chair sitting directly in front of the witness stand. He sat down and then paused for a moment before speaking.<br><br>“I have a few questions I need to ask you that will help us move forward, but first I need you to meet someone.”<br><br>“Okay, who is it?”<br><br>Detective Johnson reached into his pocket and removed a piece of paper from inside his wallet. After unfolding the paper he handed it to me, and then moved closer to me.<br><br>“This is a picture of Trevor Lockwood,” he said as he pointed at the photograph. “This man is wanted by the police for multiple counts of kidnapping and murder. According to your statement, you are the latest in a long list of women who went missing under similar circumstances.”<br><br>He moved back to the wooden chair and placed his hands behind his head.<br><br>“The details of the crimes vary in each case, but they all follow the same pattern: The women agreed to meet a handsome man on a certain date after speaking with him online, but when they arrive at the location given by the man they were never heard from again. We have five instances where this exact scenario took place, and in all cases the women went to that location, but never came back.”<br><br>The detective moved closer to me, then continued talking.<br><br>“Lockwood would go to the location where the transactions were supposed to take place, but when a woman arrived there he would either move the location or have one of his accomplices do it. In all cases, no trace of any of these women was ever found again. We have gone to the locations Lockwood has been listed at, but all traces of him were long gone.”<br><br>He moved back to the chair and straightened his tie.<br><br>“The reason why we moved so quickly in this instance is that one of our informers said that Lockwood had been planning to lure yet another woman to her death, and that he had been bragging about it online. We were able to track him down and arrest him before he could carry out his plan.”<br><br>The detective paused for a moment, then looked at me.<br><br>“So, you see, Miss Harper, you are very lucky to be alive.”<br><br>I nodded in understanding, then asked the question that had been on my mind since I had first heard about this case.<br><br>“Detective, why do you think Trevor Lockwood did this?”<br><br>The detective leaned back in his chair and sighed.<br><br>“That, Miss Harper, is something that we may never know for sure. But I have my theories.”",1
"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","Jenna Riley stood in the doorway of her family’s blue bungalow, sipping on a cold glass of milk. The air was warm and humid, and Jenna felt heavy in the muggy heat. She had worked the midnight shift at the diner all night long, and it was now four in the morning. Jenna was exhausted from working, and she wished that she could go home to her apartment soon. She passed a few other people on the sidewalk on her way home. They all wore clothes that were too warm for how humid it was outside that early in the morning. Jenna stopped to chat with one of her coworkers. Jenna wished that she worked during the day shift, like him. It would be easier on her body and easier for her to do errands during the day, rather than at night. She would have to wait until after ten thirty before she could go home and rest. She had time for a quick nap  before she had to leave for work again.<br><br>Jenna was carrying a big brown bag of books in one hand and her keys in the other as she walked down the street. She stopped to look at a flyer about a community event. As she was looking through the pages, someone grabbed her shoulder and spun her around behind her. The mugger pressed his hand over her mouth and pulled out a gun.<br><br>“Do anything stupid,” he warned, “and I’ll shoot you in the head and leave you in this alley, just like your friend.”<br><br>He was talking about the poor girl who had been found murdered in the alley behind the diner a few weeks ago. Jenna had often walked through that same alley on her way home from work. She wished that she hadn’t been too tired this morning to walk a different route.<br><br>Jenna tried to scream, but the mugger clamped his hand tighter over her mouth. When he let go of her shoulder, Jenna took advantage and ran for the doors of the library across the street. There were several people inside, working on their laptops or sitting in cozy chairs reading magazines.<br><br>“Help!” Jenna shouted, but the people either looked up from their work or kept reading. No one bothered to come out and help her.<br><br>The mugger ran up to her, grabbed at the bag of books she was holding, and screamed, “Give me your stupid books! Now!”<br><br>Jenna dropped the plastic-wrapped books, but the mugger tripped on his own feet, allowing Jenna to escape. As he stood up, he pulled out a gun and pointed it at Jenna.<br><br>Jenna knew that she couldn’t outrun him.<br><br>“Get over here or I’ll blow your brains out,” the mugger barked.<br><br>Jenna stepped closer to the man, giving him no other choice but to pull the trigger. When a shot rang out, Jenna instinctively ducked and found herself on the ground. It felt like her cheek was burning, but she couldn’t be sure.<br><br>The mugger laughed and knelt down next to her. “You made it easy for me, bitch,” he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette lighter. He looked down at Jenna  and smiled. “When I’m done with you, you won’t be able to walk home from your shift at the diner anymore.”<br><br>The mugger stood up and ignited the lighter. Jenna closed her eyes and felt a sharp pain in her face as the mugger pressed the hot end of the lighter against Jenna’s cheek. She heard a sizzle and when she opened her eyes, she saw the mugger staring at her.<br><br>Jenna sat up and coughed, blood spewing out of her mouth. She looked around and saw the mugger lighting another cigarette;  he was still sitting on the ground next to her. Jenna screamed as loud as she could and lunged forward at the mugger, knocking him off balance. The mugger fell backwards and screamed in pain as he fell onto some broken glass.<br><br>Jenna stood up, but was too weak to get very far. She stumbled to the other side of the alley and collapsed against a wall. She looked down at her hands and saw that they were covered in blood. Her shirt was also stained with blood, and she could feel it slowly seeping into her jeans.<br><br>The mugger got back to his feet and turned around; he was holding the lighter as if preparing for another attack. Jenna’s vision started to go dark, and she stumbled forward, trying to reach the diner. She reached her arms out as if to brace herself against the wall, but all she hit were cold bricks.<br><br>Jenna then felt a sharp sting in her side; she looked down and saw that she was bleeding profusely. She slowly sank to the ground, and began coughing up more blood. The mugger walked out of the alley after he saw that Jenna was lying motionless on the ground. He picked up his sunglasses from the ground and put them back on his face.<br><br>Jenna suddenly came to, and forced herself onto her knees. She heard sirens just outside the alley, and tried to crawl in the direction of the diner’s entrance. It was hard going, but she managed to make it to the door. She was about to use her hands to open it when she realized that her hand was completely covered in blood.<br><br>She then heard a voice, “It’s okay, just lean on me.” When she looked up, Damian Henchman was helping Jenna out behind the diner. Jenna coughed and spat out some blood onto the ground. She began coughing again, and then collapsed on the ground.<br><br>Jenna came to again, and this time, she found herself in a white-walled hospital room with a man in his mid twenties standing at her bedside. Jenna looked up at him, and noticed that he had long blond hair and blue eyes. His face was covered with deep, red scars. He wore a white shirt and pants that were tucked into black combat boots.

Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,", asked me if I would like to paint a picture with him. I don't remember much about the specifics of that day, but I do remember that it lasted all afternoon and included a lot of silence while both my uncle and I sat there quietly and painted. Sometimes, he would sing along with the radio, and sometimes he would just hum. He was a retired soldier who had served in Vietnam for several years before returning home without any wounds or scars on his body to show for his bravery; at least none that he ever spoke about to anyone. It was a quiet past that he kept away from us - from my siblings and me - because we were still too young to understand what it was like to hold down a machine gun or toss hand grenades at the enemy, or even see anyone die beside you because you had no other choice than to keep fighting until you were either killed or wounded.But when my uncle sat down in front of a blank canvas with his paintbrush in hand, it was as if he came back home - as if his mind had left Vietnam so long ago that it didn't matter anymore; he never spoke about it anyway so why bother? He wanted nothing more than to forget all of those memories and go back to being a painter again now that he was retired from the military. He was happy doing what he did.It made me happy to see him with a paintbrush in hand and a canvas of blankness before him as he painted our backyard with all of the flowers that mom had planted - even the ones that took up space in our window boxes during the summertime; they were always blooming and it seemed as if there were so many of them that they would never go away. I never understood why he was painting those flowers; they were everywhere and didn't really need to be on paper.But my uncle wanted to keep them alive, so maybe that's why he painted them.I looked at his canvas, realizing then that it all made sense - I couldn't understand why a soldier would want to keep flowers alive when there were lots of them outside already, but now I understood everything about what it meant to paint: you paint for yourself because it makes you happy, not for anyone else or for any reason at all; you just do it because you love the feeling of holding a brush and mixing together pretty colors on a blank canvas... how could you not want to do that?I finally understood my mother's paintings enough so I could tell her about my uncle's paintings after she asked me about one of them hanging in our living room - a colorful painting of a tree with little birds resting on some of its branches - and my eyes glimmered with tears as I explained to her, ""Mommy... he's not alive anymore.""My mother stopped moving around the kitchen and turned around, listening, waiting for me to finish. ""And?"" she said, sensing that there was more coming, knowing me well enough to know when I was finished telling my story.I felt the tears begin to fall and wiped them away with the back of my hand. My mother hugged me then and we cried together until she asked again if there was anything else that I wanted to tell her; she could tell there was something in me that wanted to be said but wasn't ready yet.""Hmm..."" I said, thinking about it for a few seconds before reaching into one of my pockets and pulling out some long strands of hair that were wrapped around a small rock.""It's Mommy's hair,"" I told her, giving the rock a squeeze before embracing her again.In the next chapter: Chapter 5- from Shannon’s perspective-----------------------------I liked how everything seemed so familiar; it made me feel like I had been here once before.But this was a new place for me - a place far from home where I had never been before. I couldn't remember ever being here before, so it was a little strange for me to feel this way. It was as if my mind was in two places at once; one of them, the familiar one, being home, and the other one being here, where I didn't know anyone and didn't belong to anyone.But it wasn't entirely strange to me either because I felt like this place was meant for me, like this place and all of its people could be my home if I wanted it to be.I had found my purpose that day in English class when we read our pieces aloud as a class - Stephen's piece hadn't changed much since we first read it aloud together; only a few lines were added that seemed to fit together with his words better than they did in the beginning. He had made his piece more than just an essay about writing and about how he thought about writing all the time; he added new lines that showed what he felt about writing now - how he saw writing as an opportunity for him to create something from nothing and make others happy with his work.When Steven finished reading his piece aloud again, Mr. Wilson looked around at all of us and then said, ""Well, guys, what do you think about Steven's piece now that he's rewritten it?""Carmen raised her hand and said that she still found it boring and stupid.Richard sent his paper from last week flying through the air toward Mr. Wilson and yelled, ""Man, I can't believe you gave me an F on this! This is total crap!""Mr. Wilson took Steven's paper to the front of the room so everyone could see it and then said, ""I really like this piece a lot more now that he has re-written it; let me know what you think.""We all started talking at once after that; everyone had something to say about Steven's piece. Some people were praising him for improving his work while others were saying that they liked his new piece just as much or even better than the old one.""The beginning seems very good to me,"" Carlos told him. ""It made me want to read more.""What a bunch of hypocrites we were being - it seemed like when we didn't like something we didn't have anything nice to say about it; but when someone did something great, we all ran over there as fast as we could to compliment them on their work. Maybe I was being a hypocrite too because I hated",0
Trevor Lockwood ends up being a serial killer who lures women to their death and Natalie narrowly escapes becoming his next victim .,"night and they start flirting with each other. She has a drunken one night stand with him and later learns that he actually is a lot older than he told her (in his mid-30's) and actually works as a photographer for a magazine. While working on one of his photography assignments, Natalie goes to the location of his shoot (a dark warehouse) and then realizes that it was actually all fake; there was no magazine or anything else. She also finds out that she's been led there in order to have sex with him in order to 're-shoot' the pictures of the model who got sick. When Natalie refuses, Trevor becomes violent towards her physically by trying to push her into having sex with him against her will.<br><br>Emotions: Natalie feels betrayed; this is because she was lied to by Trevor about who he really was and that he had intentions of raping her by doing the photo shoot under false pretenses. She feels worried that she may have gotten drugged or raped at some point during their sexual encounter because she can't remember any details about what happened between them but this is something she tries not to dwell on since she doesn't want to think about it any further than necessary. She also feels uneasy because she knows that every time someone walks through the apartment complex she lives in that they could really be the potential killer that she was in danger of meeting the other night.<br><br>Motivations: Natalie wants to find out who this strange man really is, but doesn't have any means of doing so. This is because she doesn't know who he actually is and feels too scared to even go to the police about what happened since she already made-out with him and had sex with him once before. She wants to find out where he lives in order to track him down and figure out what he was doing with her photos. The personal goal for this comic will be for Natalie to eventually find out who Trevor Lockwood is and if it's possible for her to bring him somewhere where she can confront him about abducting her from the nightclub in order to have sex with her against her will. She also wants to make sure that nobody else goes through what she went through at his hands and this is why a lot of subplots will develop over time; there will be another woman abducted by Trevor Lockwood, or another women who gets into a similar dangerous situation as Natalie did (such as a woman walking home late one night when she gets attacked by someone or something). -----------------------------<br><br>Now let's have a look at the structure of what went into creating these story elements:<br><br>As you can see, this is just an example of the type of story outline that I create when plotting out my stories. This is what I like to use and find the most useful when it comes to planning out the details of my stories but there are other types you can use as well; one that is often used by comic creators is listing down some index cards on a board and organizing them according to their chronology and then writing all of their ideas down as they come to you; be sure to include any idea you've had or any subject matter, even if it's something like ""I'm going to describe a car being driven"" or ""I think I'm going to show an animal running out of nowhere."" When doing this, make note of the times where you find yourself becoming stuck in your story and don't know how to continue it; this may mean that there's some missing information and if that's the case, then start working on doing research and coming up with ideas so that you can fill in these gaps by adding more details.<br><br>Go over your outline again and again until you have all the information needed for your story. Then go through your notes once more, deciding how best to present your story. Now that you have all the information, you can write your story in any way possible; just make sure that you know what goes where in order to have the right information included and in order to put forth the best presentation possible. For instance, a comic script can be followed by a prose novel or novella with all of your characters spoken dialogue included in it.<br><br>At this point, you should have a basic storyline for the first part of your story; any details that don't make sense at this point will most likely be ironed out during the next steps of creating your story but be sure to go over everything beforehand so that you don't waste time later when it comes to finalizing anything. I'm going to talk about my experience with other elements now and then give an in-depth look on how I implement these things into my stories when writing them down and people who are interested in trying them can see if they work well for them.<br><br>What is an Outline and Why do You Need One?<br><br>An outline is essentially a guide; it is something that helps keep track of all of the parts that make up your story as well as how they relate to one another. If something doesn't make sense, if you're unsure how something fits into your story or if you're missing a few details, this will help you out immensely. It is something that will present your ideas in a way that makes them easy to follow for anyone who views it, be it another writer or anyone else who is looking at your work. The more detailed your outline is, the better it will be because you can show every little detail that goes into making up the story and doing so will leave less room for mistakes when writing each scene. I usually include everything I want to show in my stories; all of the characters I want, how they interact with one another, what they look like and how they dress but I do not include any dialogue unless it's absolutely necessary because I personally find it very tedious to write dialogue and prefer to focus on my characters' actions instead.<br><br>Keep in mind that this isn't going to be a storyboard; an outline doesn't describe what each scene looks like because a lot of the time, this can change during writing/drawing/animating depending on what makes sense and what's necessary for telling your story properly without running into any issues. For example: If there is too much going on in one scene or too many characters",0
"With supplies running low and tensions high, the group must work together to find a way out before it's too late.","was no way they were going to miss out on their last meal together.<br><br>The sounds of their laughter and voices echoed throughout the old house as they talked about all the things that had happened since they'd found themselves in there; some of them were reminiscing about funny things that happened in the past while the others just told stories that had happened after they'd found themselves holed up in there. He laughed with them and even smiled along, he really did enjoy hearing some of their funny stories and it felt good to have a nice time with everyone, even if it was only for a little while longer. The night went on and before he knew it, one by one everyone began to fall asleep but he wasn't tired at all. That thing was still roaming around outside and he knew for certain now that it wasn't going to stop until it got what it wanted; to take over this place and kill them all. Ever so slowly he sneaked out from his bed and crept towards the door leading out of their room, knowing full well his sister wouldn't want him walking around at night when she was sleeping so close by; she didn't need to know that he was just about to go upstairs though.<br><br>He opened the door carefully and peeked outside; all he had to do was quietly walk to the kitchen and open the pantry door to his right, where they'd been storing some of the food they'd found. He closed the door and slowly made his way through the hallway when suddenly he heard a sound coming from inside one of the other rooms. He could easily tell that that thing was inside there and it didn't take long for him to realize that it was waiting for him...waiting for him to make a move so it could get a clear shot at his sister and everyone else.<br><br>He looked around, looking for anything that might be able to help him in some way but there wasn't much left in this house; all he could see were things he'd seen before without any purpose other than being decoration for the place. That's when an idea started forming inside his head, something small but it was all he had at that moment. If only he could get past this thing without waking up everyone else then maybe...maybe he'd have a chance at getting them out of there before morning came around.<br><br>It took every ounce of strength he had left in him but he managed to stay quiet while sneaking past where the thing was hiding inside one of the rooms nearby; as soon as he'd gotten past it, he ran towards the stairs without looking back. He took them two by two as he headed for the kitchen, trying his best to stay as quiet as possible. As soon as he reached the kitchen, he turned around and looked out through the wooden boards that had long ago been put up over the windows; sure enough there was that thing, still standing outside staring at something on the ground, probably waiting for him to make a move into one of the rooms nearby. He tried his best to breathe in and out calmly, wasting time but not complaining about it; all that mattered now was getting away from this place with his sister and everyone else before it was too late.<br><br>""Are you alright?""<br><br>He suddenly heard someone calling out to him and quickly turned around to look at who it was. His mother came walking towards him with a concerned look on her face; she had also been getting more and more worried as they hadn't seen or heard from him in quite some time now.<br><br>""I'm fine mom...I'm just tired,"" he told her with a smile on his face, knowing full well how important this little show of theirs really was ""I just wanted some...some water,"" he told her, acting like he was trying to find something to drink inside the kitchen.<br><br>""Oh...well, I'll get you some in a little bit. Why don't you go back to bed now?"" she asked him and he simply nodded in agreement; sure enough this little show was enough of an excuse for them to both stop doing what they were doing and go back to bed. That thing still wouldn't try anything while there were so many people around and it wouldn't do anything as long as he stayed close to the house either.<br><br>His mother turned around and slowly walked towards the door leading back into their room when suddenly that thing outside moved closer towards the window; despite being hidden by the wooden boards, it didn't take long before it saw him standing right in front of it. Ever so slowly its arm reached out towards the window and ripped down one of the boards; despite being outside, it managed to see his face clearly with its glowing eyes. It stared right at him for a few moments before disappearing into the darkness; this was his chance! As soon as that thing turned around, he ran inside their room through the backdoor leading to his sister's room where they'd been sleeping with everyone else. The thing followed him inside but just when he thought it was finally within his grasp, it disappeared with a loud bang which shook the whole house.<br><br>""What was that?"" he heard his mother ask in a nervous tone and immediately knew this thing had done something to scare them off before it could do anything to them. It scared the living hell out of him for a moment but he couldn't let that stop him from getting everyone out of there; that thing wasn't going to try anything while everyone was awake so as soon as most of them were back in their rooms, he went from one room to another and gathered up all the stuff they had with them before coming back into the main room where everyone was waiting for him. Thankfully no one even asked what he was doing until he had everything ready for their little escape.<br><br>""What are you doing?"" she asked but stopped after seeing him pointing at something behind her; she turned around only to see that thing standing just outside the bedroom door with its arm stretched out towards him. She tried calling out to him but there was nothing she could do: her fear got the better of her and she quickly ran away from its arm, taking everyone else with her as they continued moving towards the stairs.<br><br>""The car...""<br><br>",0
"Jennifer's husband and the other woman leave, and Jennifer's daughter stays with her.","she worked the hardest out of them, even during her pregnancy when it was supposed to be off limits for her.<br><br>She took a deep breath before dialing his number and waited until he picked up after hearing the first two rings. ""Are you ready to apologize?"" she asked without saying hello or even trying to be civil with him.<br><br>Eric didn't answer right away but she could hear him breathing as if he was trying not to say anything back. Jennifer felt her anger rising once more but then she decided that it made no sense to argue with him right now since he was too busy feeling guilty about everything that happened so far.<br><br>""I'll see you at home later, I have a lot of work to catch up on today."" said Jennifer before hanging up and putting her phone back in her purse once more. She didn't bother making any breakfast for herself and instead planned on having something outside than sitting inside the house all day long just thinking about what had happened between Eric, his mistress and herself earlier in the day. She had a lot of work ahead of her today so she better get started on doing it so that she would have enough time to take care of James later if necessary, knowing that Eric wasn't going to be there when she needed him.<br><br>*<br><br>When Jennifer came home later that day, James had already gone to bed and Eric was sitting on the sofa watching TV. She walked towards him and took off her heels before sitting next to him as he continued watching his program without saying anything at first. ""I'm sorry."" he mumbled after a few moments of silence.<br><br>She held her breath for a second before finally speaking. ""I need you to do something for me."" she said slowly, trying not to let her anger get the best of her in that moment. Eric looked at her then nodded his head slowly, making sure not to say anything even if it was just out of fear that it would anger Jennifer even further if he did something wrong. ""I want you to take care of James while I clean up my mess."" she said calmly before standing up and taking off the jacket that she was wearing earlier on in the day with a heavy sigh as she looked back at Eric once more who didn't seem to want to move from his place on the couch.<br><br>Jennifer turned around and went towards their bedroom without saying anything else, wondering what it would be like for them if she decided never to talk about their problems anymore instead of trying to make things right. She didn't feel like it was worth it anymore, not when there were still so many things that they needed to work out and she just wanted to leave it all behind and never give Eric a second chance.<br><br>She put her shoes inside her closet after hanging up her jacket and then made her way towards the kitchen once more where she looked through the cabinets for anything edible. She found some crackers that she liked eating back when she was still pregnant with James and so no matter how full she felt at the moment, Jennifer had to eat something since the doctor told her that she needed to take good care of herself while pregnant because then James would be strong as well.<br><br>She sat down on a chair before opening the package containing the crackers and taking one out with a sigh of relief. The whole situation was really getting on her nerves and she hated thinking about it even longer than this moment right now, but what else could she do if he wasn't ready to apologize or talk about what had happened between him, his mistress and their family?<br><br>When Jennifer heard footsteps coming from the living room where Eric was sitting on that couch with his phone in his hand, she closed her eyes for a moment before opening them back up and continuing to eat the cracker instead of getting up to talk to him about everything. It wasn't her fault that he had slept with another woman, it was his decision and so she was going to be the bigger person here and not let her anger get the best of her for once in her life.<br><br>""He told me that he needed you."" said Eric in a quiet voice as he sat down opposite her, looking at Jennifer as if he didn't want to look away from her at all. She continued eating the cracker carefully before looking at him for a moment before sighing. ""How much longer is this going to go on?"" she asked quietly, looking at him with hopeful eyes, wondering if it would really help if she pretended like nothing had happened between them when in reality, they had just gotten into their first fight ever since they first met.<br><br>""I don't know."" he said, feeling sad when Jennifer refused to look at him or even reply anything else back. She was angry with him and there was no use denying it any longer, but what could he do? He knew that it was his fault that she found out about his affair with his mistress earlier in the day and yet there wasn't anything that he could do to make her feel like staying with him was what she wanted.<br><br>""You'll talk to me?"" she asked, furrowing her eyebrows together when Eric nodded his head slowly. ""Are you going to apologize for last night or whatever it was that happened?"" she asked in a soft tone, looking at Eric as she saw him biting his lower lip. ""I shouldn't have found out about your affair and I should have left you both alone that night."" said Jennifer, taking another cracker from the package and looking at him once more.<br><br>""I know."" said Eric in a soft voice as he looked down at the ground in shame, wondering what he should say next. ""I'm sorry.""<br><br>Chapter 3: Chapter 3 (Falling In Love With The Enemy) ----------------------------- Jennifer woke up with a small yawn before turning around in her bed to face the window that was right across her bed and looked at all of the beautiful rays of sunshine peeking out of it that made it look like it was going to be such a beautiful day today after everything that happened between them yesterday. She closed her eyes once more before sitting up on her bed and then looking around to see if James had woken up yet",1

His mind began to fill with thoughts of Aimee now; thoughts of how when she ran away from him after meeting Jack earlier, it felt like someone had ripped out his heart or soul because of how much it hurt him to see her running away from him like that....he knew then how much she meant to him because of how much he felt when they parted ways....and then there was Lola....the way that their entire relationship had been starting to change lately because of everything between them",0
The world ends in a cataclysmic event.,"One day, the world just ended.<br><br>    The sky turned red and the ground shook. Everyone knew it was the end for all of them. The lights went out, the electricity left, along with the running water and all other necessities that people took for granted. The world ended.<br><br>And then it started again. A flash of green light and a brilliant white sound filled the sky as if the world was being zapped clean. And then it happened again. And again.<br><br>And suddenly, everything was ok again in the world, but darker than before. Some said that heaven came to earth and wiped the world clean, and that everything would be fine from now on. But that didn’t really explain why there was so much darkness afterwards. Why it seemed darker than before. Why the world seemed smaller somehow, like a smaller version of itself. Why people kept seeing ghosts everywhere and zombies, and demons and all kinds of creatures that should have died in the cataclysm that had just happened.<br><br>The world was ending again, but this time for real. The blackness in the world was spreading. Soon everything would be gone forever. The end of the world had come for real this time .<br><br>The sun gave way to the blackness, and in the middle of it all, was a huge ring of light that shone brightly from all over the earth. It came out of nowhere, and there was no explanation for it whatsoever. But everyone knew what it was. And they knew it meant the end of the world was finally here.<br><br>As the sky got darker, and then darker still, and the ring of light turned into a circle of light that seemed to emanate from the ground beneath them, darkness finally fell over everything. All of nature went silent. The birds stopped singing, grass stopped growing, flowers stopped blooming, trees stopped leafing. Rivers and streams dried up.<br><br>And then the sky turned red.<br><br>The whole sky turned red, like the color of blood. And the ground shook violently beneath them as all of nature was overcome with a terrible heat that seemed to come from below their feet.  So people ran away in terror, everyone trying to get as far away from each other as possible. Everyone ran for their own lives as fast as they possibly could, not knowing what would happen next, nor where they would run to. They just knew they had to get away from others as fast as possible before the end came upon them.<br><br>The people were in such a terrible state of panic and confusion, that when Maria Martinez tried to ask the others what was going on, no one paid any attention to her. All they could think of was getting away from everyone else and somewhere safe, and so they all ignored her. Maria  ran around in circles for a while trying to figure out what was happening and where to go, but it was hopeless.<br><br>“I don’t know what to do! What should I do?” she cried out desperately into the night air as she ran around in circles on the plaza. The sun disappeared behind a wall of flames that burned its way across the horizon like a fiery river and plunged the world into darkness. It was now pitch black and eerie shadows danced all around as if some otherworldly creatures were playing tricks on them.<br><br>Maria felt so frightened that she was shaking uncontrollably, but she  didn’t have much time to think, because the ground started to crumble and buildings collapsed as the earth shook violently beneath their feet. Everyone began screaming and trying to run away as fast as they could, not knowing what was causing this, or where to go.  Maria could hear the sound of glass breaking and the distant, terrified screams of her neighbors as she ran through the streets just like everyone else.<br><br>Maria looked up at the night sky and saw a bright light shining down from it. It spread its beams out across the landscape like a million tiny spotlights, illuminating everything in sight. Everything looked different now, as if it was lit up by some weird light that didn’t belong there. Suddenly, the sky went dark again and it seemed as if a hole had opened in the Earth from which they could see far below them. The moon disappeared and the stars vanished from the sky, plunging the world into darkness. Then the ground fractured and an enormous crack spread from horizon to horizon, swallowing up everything in its path.<br><br>The sky faded to red as fire engulfed the world. Finally, the light faded and everything went silent once more. Then a blinding flash of white fire burst forth, engulfing the sky.<br><br>The ground crumbled and opened up, swallowing up not only the sky but everything in sight. Trees, buildings, cars; all disappeared like dust in a rainstorm. Everything except for one lone building which stood unharmed at the center of all this chaos; untouched by the chaos  that engulfed everything else.<br><br>Cars and bodies flew through the air like dust in the wind. When they landed, they scattered across the land like seeds from a bomb blast. The people who had once lived and worked there were forced to watch their homes, their friends and family die before their eyes; right before they were swallowed up by the ground below.<br><br>The ground crumbled and split apart as if it too was dying. Then, with a loud crash and a thunderous roar, everything stopped. The land fell silent again, as if nothing had ever happened at all. In the distant void of space, where the ground had shattered, a dark figure was standing on top of a stone pillar. It raised up its massive black arm, opening its mouth and sending out a beam of white fire that shot into the sky. Its mouth opened wider as it swallowed the whole world …<br><br>… and nothing else was left.",1
Mary Smith walks home from work and becomes the victim of a mugging attempt by John Doe.,"<br><br>Mary walked home from her job at the local bank. The journey was a long one, since her office was near the outer edge of the city and she lived in the center of town. She was glad that the weather was good enough to walk home, although the walk could get a bit strenuous on some days, depending on traffic and other conditions.<br><br>So engrossed was Mary in her thoughts that she did not look up, even though she had heard footsteps approaching behind her. It was only when she heard someone call out for her to stop that she turned around and saw a man running out of an alley towards her.<br><br>“Halt!” he shouted. Her mind raced as she tried to think up ways to escape this man who had presumably just robbed someone else in this area. She started walking faster and tried walking down another street that looked like it led back towards town but there were no cars or pedestrians around now so this didn’t seem like a sound plan either. The mugger started running towards Mary, calling for her to stop again but his words were becoming increasingly strangled as he sprinted nearer and nearer to Mary.<br><br>Mary stopped running when he called out for the third time and turned around to face him. The man was still panting from the exertion of running but regained his breath quickly, glaring at Mary with a look that made her want to run and hide.<br><br>“Stupid bitch,” the man muttered and made a lunge towards Mary, grabbing her arm tightly enough so that she knew she would have bruises there in a few days. He dragged her into an alley and into some bushes where no one would be able to see them. “Now hand over all your valuables. If you don’t comply, I can easily harm you, missy.”<br><br>Mary handed over her purse and proceeded to take off her ring as well but did not hand it over yet. She hoped she could use this opportunity to escape from this situation without any harm being done. As the mugger took Mary’s handbag, he noticed he was shaking; he was nervous about taking this woman’s money or possessions for fear of being caught by the police for assaulting someone else on their way home from work or school or wherever it was they were coming from that day. He had been mugging people for years now but along came this girl who changed everything he thought about robbery. He didn’t know why, but he felt a strange connection to her; as if something was drawing him towards her.<br><br>As the mugger walked towards Mary to take her ring, she grabbed her purse and made a run for it. The mugger stepped out of the bushes just in time to see Mary running off, clutching onto the purse he had been about to steal from her. “Wait!” he called out with all his might.<br><br>Mary didn’t stop running until she was almost home and then she ran up the stairs and banged on the door of her flat. Patrick opened the door and smiled when he saw that it was Mary who had barged in on them unannounced. “Hi Mary, what are you doing back so early today?”<br><br>Mary started panting as she tried to catch her breath enough to answer Patrick’s question. “Someone tried to rob me and I ran away, oh God I still can’t breathe properly.” A few moments later, Mary finally managed to say more than one sentence at a time but only just barely. “I think I need some mints or something because my breath stinks! Do you have any?”<br><br>Patrick laughed. “You know that’s the least of your problems right?”<br><br>Mary shook her head. “No, don’t ask me questions like that, Pat. You scare me when you talk about things like that. My day was already bad enough, I don’t want to think about what would happen if you mention anything worse happening to me today!” Mary took a few more deep breaths before she went on with her story. “I was walking home from work today and some guy tried to rob me so I ran away and he chased after me but he didn’t catch me so all is well…I guess.”<br><br>Patrick smiled before stepping out of the door and locking it behind him as he walked out into the hall. “Well then, I think you should tell your story to someone who can actually do something about this mugging problem. After all, our neighbour is a cop and the department to report these things happens to be across from him so why don’t we walk over there now? He might even want to come help us investigate the area where it happened then we can try finding that mugger and find out why he was so desperate to steal from you.”<br><br>Mary folded her arms in front of her. “But I don’t want to go to the police with this, Pat. That would be a waste of their time and mine because it won’t happen again. Besides, I don’t think that guy will come back here again after seeing that I live here with other people who can protect me from him from now on. So really, there is no need for me to make a report or go anywhere else for that matter. This is it; case closed, end of story!”<br><br>Patrick shook his head but smiled at the same time while gripping onto Mary’s shoulder tightly before saying one more thing he wanted her to hear very clearly. “Well then, maybe if you don’t realise what an important part of the police force you are by reporting things like that to our neighbours then maybe we won’t be such good neighbours anymore? Maybe you should find some new ones and leave us behind? Don’t worry though; we will always have a place in your heart because your first kiss was right here! ”<br><br>Mary bl",0
"John Doe, the serial killer, tells Valerie that she must escape the basement before dawn or else she will become his next trophy.","to come down the stairs. She saw a set of keys on top of one of the boxes that were all around the basement, and she started to search until she found one with a keychain that said: John Doe in bold letters. Valerie quickly grabbed the keys and darted forward, only to find another solid door in front of her.<br><br>She once again tried the key and found that it would not open this door either. Valerie slid down to the floor of the basement and started to cry. She was trapped in a basement with an insane murderer, and she had no idea what he would do to her next. She closed her eyes, and she could hear the footsteps coming toward her. She tightened up and prepared herself as the door opened.<br><br>The killer ran at Valerie, but she evaded his grasp by rolling out of the way. He kicked her in the side of the head, knocking her to the ground once again. He picked her up by the neck and slammed her down on a nearby table. Valerie’s body went limp as she struggled to breathe.<br><br>He moved to his right side of the basement, where he had placed Valerie’s lifeless body. He placed his hands on her stomach and began to press  in, feeling her ribs pop from his pressure. Valerie grabbed the table with both hands and screamed in pain.<br><br>“Who are you? I don’t know who you are, put me down!” Valerie yelled, but John Doe ignored her cries and continued to feel her up. <br><br>“You have to escape, and you have to do it before dawn. You know that, don’t you? That’s how this game works. You have to escape before dawn or else I will begin taking your life away piece by piece.” John said, his voice thick and ominous.<br><br>Valerie continued to scream as she felt her body being violated. She gritted her teeth and forced herself to stand again, using the table for support.<br><br>John Doe looked at the young woman and smiled. He was about to say something when he heard a noise come from upstairs. He  quickly stood up and grabbed Valerie by the throat, strangling her with his bare hands.<br><br>“What are you doing? Put me down!” Valerie screamed, but she could only manage weak coughs.<br><br>She tried to thrash around in an attempt to loosen his grip, but John Doe was strong. He looked at Valerie with contempt and said, “I want to make this clear to you. You have a head start, and it’s your best chance of getting out of here alive. But if you don’t get out before dawn, then I will come after you myself and give you a head start of your own – head to my chopping block.”<br><br>John Doe let go of Valerie’s throat and walked over to the steps. He turned around and gave the young woman one last cold look before he went upstairs. <br><br>Valerie looked at the basement steps for a brief moment, hoping that John Doe would come down and finish her off. She saw the cellar door start to open, but it was too late; John Doe had left her alone with the sun just beginning to rise from the horizon.<br><br>Valerie shakily reached underneath her and felt for the door handle. She turned around and ran up the steps, falling over in her haste to get away from the basement. She ran into John Doe’s living room, which was now adorned with blood-stained sheets on the walls and blackened  photographs that once showed his happy family, and she ran into the bedroom where his wife and children used to sleep until they were ripped away by his psychotic hands.<br><br>Valerie saw her chance to escape when John Doe came back into the house – he had gone upstairs to change his bloody clothes – and she took off through the front door, which slammed shut behind her.<br><br>John Doe opened the door, ready to chase after Valerie. He stopped when she ran down the steps of the front porch and disappeared around the corner. She was running straight into oncoming traffic, but John Doe did not care. He only cared about one",1
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"Anna Cooper entered the office, a middle-aged black woman with a kind face. She wore a white uniform shirt and black pants that fit perfectly, even if her employer, Mrs. Miller, was not a size six. Mrs. Miller was sitting behind the principal’s desk, typing into her computer. A computer Anna Cooper had never seen before and would not have known how to use if it had been offered to her.<br><br>She stood at attention in front of the desk. She was a janitor and she wanted to show respect for her office, but mainly because there was no one else around. Her first day on job she had come early to get a feel for the place, and now she was waiting patiently.<br><br>Anna Cooper did not know if she would enjoy working for Mrs. Miller yet. But at least she had her looks going for her, and that was more than most of the other janitors at the school could say. Anna Cooper realized that she was being hard on herself. She was pretty, but she was also old. Not old in years, but certainly in looks. And she knew that Mrs. Miller thought she looked like a grandmother-type person, which wasn’t a compliment in Anna’s opinion.  But she was almost forty and did not want to look like she was twenty-five. She had been so young when her daughter died.<br><br>Anna Cooper felt that the principal did not even know her name yet, but Anna Cooper knew Mrs. Miller’s and had studied it carefully in case the principal expected to be called by her first name. It was a complicated one, Karen, but Anna was ready for it.<br><br>Finally the door opened and Karen walked into the room. Anna could tell at once that something was bothering her. “Mrs. Miller?” she said as she approached the desk, then  stopped briefly to give the principal more space. “I’m Anna Cooper.”<br><br>Mrs. Miller held out her hand and said quickly, “Please call me Karen. We need to be on first name terms, Anna. So I hear you are an excellent janitor and that you come highly recommended.”<br><br>Anna Cooper knew that the principal was trying to be friendly, but she was feeling off-put by the woman. And she didn’t like to be called Janitor instead of by her title. But she wanted it known that she didn’t take any nonsense from anyone. “I am not a janitor, Mrs. Miller. I have a title and I wish you would use it when addressing me.”<br><br>There was a brief silence after this statement, but then the principal said in an apologetic tone, “Of course you are, Anna. You are the head janitor and that’s what everyone calls you, right?”<br><br>“No! That is not correct. I am the Director of Facilities Management. Please call me by my title, Mrs. Miller. Or Ms Cooper if you prefer to be polite.”<br><br>Karen frowned at this and then said, “Well, I’ll just call you Janitor Cooper. It’s easier that way. Now, I need to know if you have any special talents in cleaning supplies? Do you use a certain kind of mop? How do you like to clean the floors?“<br><br>It was clear that Karen was trying to cover up for her earlier rudeness, but Anna Cooper wasn’t going to let her off the hook. She was offended by the term Janitor and it was also clear that Karen Miller had a problem with following orders. She was already starting to suspect that this would not be a good working relationship.<br><br>However, while this is something that she could work with, there were much more pressing issues. Anna Cooper needed to know what kind of writing was on the chalkboards and whether or not there were any more symbols that matched the one Daniel had shown her.<br><br>“I have no special talents in cleaning supplies,” Anna Cooper said directly. She figured this would get the discussion going again in the right direction.<br><br>“Well, that’s just great! We’re going to have a nice long talk about this ,” Karen Miller snapped.<br><br>“I think that is a bad idea,” Anna Cooper responded, “But it seems to me that you have an agenda and I don’t think it has anything to do with helping me out. So I suggest we end this conversation right here.”<br><br>The principal looked at the janitor for a second and then seemed to deflate. “Okay, but if that symbol shows up again, even on the back of a piece of paper in the trash can, I want to know about it first thing. Do you understand?”<br><br>One of the most obvious aspects of symbolism on the chalkboard is that it includes pictures of crucifixion.<br><br>Crucifixion is an old form of execution in which someone is nailed to a wooden cross. Crucifixion was originally meant as a form of punishment for those who were considered evil or heretics. Crucifixion was widely practiced by the Romans, but became increasingly unpopular in Western Europe.<br><br>Crucifixion was outlawed in some countries during the Middle Ages, but it was still practiced in England until 1853, and remained a legal method of execution in some of the world until very recently. Crucifixion is an extremely unusual method of execution for modern times, and it has been used mostly by people who are considered to be fringe groups or religious extremists.<br><br>Flailing crucifixions is a specific form of crucifixion where the victim is tied and whipped before being nailed to a cross. Flailing crucifixions refers to the violent whipping that usually accompanies crucifixion. Flailing is not an official part of the method of crucifixion, but it does occur often in countries that still practice it. Flailing is typically done with sharp metal rods or other implements, and often includes brutal beatings. The beating takes place while the cross is being raised off of the ground, and flailing is supposed to make the crucifixion more painful. Crucifixions are sometimes depicted in art, including famous works on the subject by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Flailing crucifixions are more common in modern times than flogging deaths, but depictions of both continue to appear in mainstream art.<br><br>Flailing crucifixions have been condemned by many religious leaders over the years. During the Middle Ages, flailing was condemned by Pope Gregory IX, who called it a sacrilegious act.<br><br>Crucifixion is an extreme form of torture,",0

"Natalie Harper makes a deal with Trevor Lockwood, a man she met online, to meet him in person in exchange for money so that she can pay her rent .","Natalie Harper made small talk with Trevor Lockwood online for several months. She was attracted to his confidence and good looks, even though he was nearly twenty years her senior. She saw herself as a confident woman, but she lacked the courage to approach him in public, nor would she do so out of respect for her boyfriend. So Natalie Harper had turned to the internet, where she found Trevor Lockwood. He was interested in meeting her in person, if she had enough money for their date. Natalie Harper agreed and they set up a time and place to meet. Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what kind of man she would date. Natalie Harper said that she would go out with someone like Trevor Lockwood, although he was not much older than her. Natalie Harper asked Trevor Lockwood if he was married. He said he wasn’t and had no children. She asked him if he lived alone, and again, his answer was positive. Natalie Harper met Trevor Lockwood in a coffee shop on the second floor of a shopping center in East Sacramento. She asked him to meet her there, but she did not tell him why. She gave him the agreed-upon amount of money—five hundred dollars—which he assured her would be enough for their date . Trevor Lockwood then gave Natalie Harper an address in rural Northern California and told her to come there. Natalie Harper was aware of Trevor Lockwood’s offer prior to this meeting, but she just needed to talk with him face-to-face to make sure he really meant her no harm. Natalie Harper got  in her car and drove towards the area where Trevor Lockwood told her he lived. She turned off Interstate 80 and drove on the country roads that led into his neighborhood. The roads were isolated, but she had a small map with the directions that Trevor Lockwood had given her. Natalie Harper arrived at his home after driving for about an hour. It was a large house set on a hill, surrounded by forest land. Natalie Harper parked her car on the side of the road and walked up to the front door of the house. She knocked and was immediately greeted by Trevor Lockwood, who opened it with a key he retrieved from inside.  Natalie Harper stepped into the house and greeted Trevor Lockwood.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was wearing a black short-sleeved shirt underneath a red cardigan sweater. His face was clean-shaven, except for a goatee that was trimmed close to his mouth. He had dark brown hair, short at the sides and about two inches long in the back. His eyes were blue and he gave off a strong and commanding presence to those he met. Trevor Lockwood was twenty-four years old and living with his parents in their five-bedroom house. He worked part-time at a small marketing firm in San Francisco, but his income was not very high. Trevor Lockwood invited Natalie Harper to sit down on the couch in his living room.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper how she liked driving up to his house. She said that she had enjoyed the drive, as it was quiet and peaceful. Trevor Lockwood moved to the edge of the couch and cleared a spot for Natalie Harper. Trevor Lockwood moved closer to Natalie Harper and sat down next to her.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood told Natalie Harper that he really enjoyed talking with her online and that he would have much preferred talking with her in person, but circumstances had prevented him from doing so. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand up to Natalie Harper’s shoulder.<br><br>Natalie Harper reached for Trevor Lockwood’s hand and placed it on her thigh. She looked at his lips and then smiled at him as she moved her head closer to his mouth. Trevor Lockwood moved his head away from her.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper if she had thought of any names for the business venture they were discussing. Trevor Lockwood explained that he had already thought of a name, but he was always willing to listen to suggestions from others. Trevor Lockwood moved his hand slowly up the inside of her thigh and moved it towards her crotch.<br><br>Natalie Harper moved Trevor Lockwood’s hand away. She was surprised that Trevor had touched her so soon in their conversation, as they still had so many details to discuss. She told Trevor Lockwood of two possible names that she wanted to consider, and Trevor Lockwood nodded his head.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked if he could move closer to Natalie Harper on the couch. Natalie Harper agreed and Trevor Lockwood moved next to her on the couch.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood asked Natalie Harper what she wanted him to do",1

After all, our neighbour is a cop and the department to report these things happens to be across from him so why don’t we walk over there now? He might even want to come help us investigate the area where it happened then we can try finding that mugger and find out why he was so desperate to steal from you.”<br><br>Mary folded her arms in front of her. “But I don’t want to go to the police with this, Pat. That would be a waste of their time and mine because it won’t happen again. Besides, I don’t think that guy will come back here again after seeing that I live here with other people who can protect me from him from now on. So really, there is no need for me to make a report or go anywhere else for that matter. This is it; case closed, end of story!”<br><br>Patrick shook his head but smiled at the same time while gripping onto Mary’s shoulder tightly before saying one more thing he wanted her to hear very clearly. “Well then, maybe if you don’t realise what an important part of the police force you are by reporting things like that to our neighbours then maybe we won’t be such good neighbours anymore? Maybe you should find some new ones and leave us behind? Don’t worry though; we will always have a place in your heart because your first kiss was right here! ”<br><br>Mary bl",0
Shannon's paintings begin to take on a life of their own and Shannon starts to feel like her paintings are her new family.,"Stephen's piece last week with all of its text and heavy writing - its lack of life - but it was a good thing that he didn't listen to me and instead he rewrote his piece, making it something it was never supposed to be in the first place - something alive.I was glad I didn't tell him how much I hated it; if I had, he might have just given up on his piece, on us. He might have stopped caring about finishing his piece at all, not wanting us to see what we had done to him by giving him an F on this paper.""Did you really like my piece?"" Steven asked me after class.I just looked at him and smiled; I couldn't say anything because I was too nervous that I might say the wrong thing.I was more nervous than usual around Steven now because he had asked me to help him with his piece last week and even though we still weren't exactly friends, he seemed to like me more now. And there was also the fact that we'd kissed in front of everyone yesterday; it felt weird when everyone went back to acting like nothing happened after we kissed but then again it felt weird when we were still acting like nothing happened afterwards as well.""Do you want to walk home together before we go to class?"" he asked me.I said yes and we started walking to his next class, still holding hands. It was a pretty nice feeling when we were holding hands or when he would squeeze my hand when we were walking together. I wished that things could stay this way forever; I was so happy right now that it didn't really matter what happened in the future. It seemed like the sun was shining brighter today and the autumn leaves had turned a little more golden than usual.""How did you like my new piece?"" he asked me as we walked.""I liked it,"" I told him, ""it's not just about writing anymore though, it's about how you feel about writing now instead of how you've always felt about writing.""He smiled at me and squeezed my hand tight. Maybe our being friends wasn't such a bad idea after all - well at least not as bad as I thought it would be before yesterday.We walked in silence for a while until Steven finally said something else.""Will you still help me with my piece?"" I smiled at him again but this time kept walking instead of stopping because I didn't want to slow down the flow of time for us too much.""Of course,"" I told him; ""even though we're not friends, or even dating, I like helping you with your piece and if I didn't like helping you with your piece, then I wouldn't do it.""""Maybe you should do more things for the people that you like,"" Steven told me.""You mean like for people who are my friends?"" I asked him.""No,"" he said, ""just people that you care about.""""I don't know,"" I told him; ""do we even like each other?""""That's a stupid question,"" he said. ""When was the last time you thought about me without having to be reminded to think about me? When was the last time that I wasn't on your mind?"" he asked me.I couldn't answer him because he was right - what did that have to do with liking someone, though? Did liking someone have to mean being constantly on their mind? It's not like Steven had ever been so preoccupied by me that it would have been difficult for him to talk about anything else - where and when are we going to get together again, what are we going to do when we get together next time, why is he walking faster than me? Those kinds of questions were never popping into my mind - in fact, the only questions popping into my mind when it came to Steven were about our current relationship. For one thing, I wondered why he liked me enough to keep asking me out but then not be willing to consider dating me. Not that it mattered anymore because I didn't want anything more than friendship from him; it just seemed like a bad idea to be friends with someone you liked so much.How could I have fallen in love with someone without even realizing that I was in love with them?""I don't know,"" Steven told me but he was smiling now and squeezing my hand tighter than before; ""it's just not right that you only think about me when we're together and then spend the rest of your time thinking about everything else.""""I guess,"" I told him.""You think too much,"" he said, ""just go with the flow for once in your life.""""Let's go by this tree that's by the school entrance,"" Steven suggested when we got closer to the school entrance.We sat down together on a bench underneath a big oak tree and looked out at the lawn of the school grounds.""Is this where you usually sit?"" I asked him.""Sometimes,"" he said; ""most of the time though, we don't sit under an oak tree - we sit under an apple tree.""""An apple tree?"" I asked him.""Are you going to ask me where I sit?"" he asked me but this time, he was smiling at me.""Maybe,"" I said.He didn't tell me where or in what tree he sat with his friends but he did say that they sat together and talked about their feelings and how they were feeling inside. They also gave each other advice on how to be more happy and comfortable with themselves....etc.I thought it sounded really, really weird but I didn't say anything to Steven because if I did, then maybe he would stop talking and I kind of liked hearing him talk - it was like no matter what we were talking about, it always felt like just the two of us.Steven stayed for a long time after that - the bell rang for class before we even realized what time it was (we had been sitting there together for over two hours.)""Do you have any classes with Cal today?"" Steven asked me.""No,"" I told him; ""why do you ask? It's not like you would go to his classes if we had any together.""""No,"" Steven said; ""that wouldn't be a good idea - besides, Cal likes to have lunch by himself so he can think about things.""""Cal's never really struck me as someone",0
Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"not here,"" she said as the sniffles continued to rack through her body. ""I'm scared.""<br><br>""Who isn't here?"" John asked as he tried to figure out what she was going on about.<br><br>""The man that attacked me is,"" Jenna said before saying, ""Oh god. He's coming back.""<br><br>John looked over his shoulder and then back at the door of Jenna's house before looking up and down the road before saying, ""Jenna what are you talking about? What man attacked you?""<br><br>""The man...the one that made me like this,"" Jenna stammered out but before she could continue speaking he heard a loud bang from inside the house, then a louder thump followed by another bang and the line went dead.<br><br>John looked down at his cell phone in his hand and after another look at the front door just to make sure that it was locked he began backing away from it as his eyes grew large with fear for her safety. He tried to call her again but there was no answer so he hung up then threw his cell phone into his car before taking out a gun that he always kept in his car and shoving it into his belt. Then he kicked open the door of the house and ran up the stairs as he tried to figure out where the sound had come from, assuming at first that it had been in her bedroom. As he reached the top of the staircase he could feel his heart racing like mad as he held the gun out in front of him and with his other hand he began turning the doorknob to her bedroom.<br><br>She was on her back still in her pajamas and half covered by blankets but clearly unconscious as she lay there with a leg bent at an odd angle and a gash in her forehead that was bleeding freely down her face. ""Jenna!"" John said before dropping to his knees beside her bed and taking hold of one of her hands. It was cold to his touch so he quickly took off his sweatshirt then placed it over her body but as soon as it came into contact with her skin she began shaking violently as if she would shatter any second and then suddenly sat up with gripping eyes that were pure white.<br><br>""Get away from me,"" Jenna snarled at him and then grabbed his face between both hands before sinking her teeth into his neck, biting down hard enough that blood was flowing from the wound.<br><br>As Jenna drank from him, John tried to scream out but no sound left his throat but wheezing breaths. She was too strong for him to fight and it didn't take him long before he lost consciousness and slid off the side of her bed onto the floor below.<br><br>Jenna fell back down on the bed only after draining John dry and then licked the wound on his neck to close it up before sitting up and looking over at him. ""I'm sorry,"" she said as she looked down at her hand and saw blood on her fingertips, ""but I could not let you take me away.""<br><br>With that said Jenna stood up from her bed and moved over to John's body before leaning down over him and pressing her lips against his in a gentle kiss that lasted for several seconds before pulling away again. It was the first time since she had been changed into a vampire that she had kissed anyone, but this one had felt like goodbye. With that thought in mind she turned around then walked out of her bedroom door and into the hallway, stopping next to her bedroom window where she looked through it at all of the houses that were lit up with lights on inside of them. It was nighttime still so most everyone was asleep right now which meant that there would be no witnesses to what she was about to do.<br><br>Jenna pulled open the window and stepped over the ledge onto the ground outside, then closed it behind her as she turned back around to face the house next to hers. A moment later she felt warm hands taking hold of her arms from behind her and pulling her backwards with a force that caused her to fall flat against a male chest. She quickly tried to turn around again but before she could do so someone had moved up beside of her and wrapped their arms around both of hers, holding them close against her body. Then she felt something cold being placed against either side of her head and it was only when he spoke that she realized who it was.<br><br>""It's been quite some time since we've seen each other face to face, hasn't it?"" Michael said as he stood there in front of Jenna with sunglasses covering up his black eyes while his dark hair moved softly in the wind next to his pale face. ""I know that you still have my bracelet on your wrist,"" he said referring to the silver charm bracelet he had given her for their first Christmas together back when neither one of them had known what was going on between them.<br><br>""I'm sorry,"" Jenna said softly before turning away from him, ""but I cannot leave with you.""<br><br>Michael looked down at her and saw that the front door to her house had opened and someone was standing there watching them before closing it again. ""So you were involved with him?"" he asked after releasing his grip on Jenna and taking a few steps back.<br><br>""I have already brought him back,"" Jenna replied as she pulled a business card out of her pocket and handed it to Michael. ""The number on the card is to the place where they are keeping him until they decide what to do.""<br><br>Michael took the card from her then looked down at it as he felt his hand being grabbed from behind by Ellen who had just come out of Jenna's house and walked up beside him. She took his hand within hers before looking over at Jenna again. ""He was talking about going inside,"" she said trying to keep calm for herself, ""and I wasn't sure what he might do.""<br><br>""He didn't hurt me,"" Jenna said with a small smile on her face that faded when she saw Michael glare over at Ellen in anger.<br><br>""You should have given us a chance! Why couldn't you have just trusted us?"" he shouted angrily while moving towards her",0
A group of survivors find themselves holed up in an old house in the middle of nowhere.,"For weeks, the group had been holed up in the old house. They were all tired of being inside, but the woods outside were dangerous. The woods harbored plenty of animals, and the thought that a rabid wolf or bear could run into the house was still enough to make them afraid. They had found a way to block all of the doors except for the front door, but they were still afraid of what might be outside.<br><br>There was no food left in the back of the house, and they had already eaten all of their food. They needed to find more food in order to survive. They must think of ways to get out of the house in order to stay alive.<br><br>The group had stayed together out of necessity, but they did not know each other very well. They had spent every day together after their escape from the hospital, but they did not really know each other that well. They knew that staying alive was easier if they stayed together.<br><br>In the beginning of the group’s stay in the house, there had been tension among them, but eventually they overcame their differences and started working together, despite disagreements over what to do on occasion. They must learn how to work together in order to stay alive .<br><br>They did not know much about each other at all, and they knew that there were certain things that they could say to each other without starting unnecessary arguments. They needed to discuss how the group was going to move forward in order to survive.<br><br>Jennifer would think about her father from time to time, and try to learn as much as she could from the others about what had happened. If they learned how to work together for their mutual benefit, they could learn a lot of valuable information that would help them stay alive.<br><br>Stephanie knew that she would never be able to trust Jennifer completely; after all,  she had made a move on her boyfriend, and then lied about it. But if Jennifer showed an interest in working with the group as a whole, and proved trustworthy, Stephanie might be able to put aside her differences with her.<br><br>She waited until after breakfast—which was an egg omelet—to broach the subject.<br><br>“Who’s going out to get fish?” Stephanie asked, sitting in front of the fire with Jennifer and Johnathan Hill. The group had found a couple dozen fish in a lake nearby, but they needed more. They needed fresh protein, something that could sustain the group for a few weeks at least.<br><br>The group needed to find a source of freshwater, something that would provide them with clean water for drinking and bathing.<br><br>“I’ll go find some fresh water,” Johnathan said,  standing and stretching.<br><br>“I’ll take you,” Jennifer said, jumping up as well. “We can walk through the woods nearby, and maybe we can find a stream or something.”<br><br>Stephanie rolled her eyes and turned back to the fire.<br><br>“You’re not a great fighter,” she said, turning toward Jennifer. “And it would be very helpful if you stay here and protected the rest of us. If you leave, I don’t know what will happen to the rest of us. You could die out there, and we’d be all alone and defenseless. If we get attacked while you’re gone, what are we supposed to do? Just lie down and die? We need someone here watching over us at all times so that doesn’t happen.”<br><br>Stephanie had a point. Jennifer looked back at Stephanie with a small smile of agreement. She did need to stay with the rest of the group as much as possible. There were more than enough weapons in the house to protect them, and if anyone came near the house, they’d be able to hear it.<br><br>“I’m sorry, I know I said that I wanted to go, but you’re right. We can’t risk losing any of us, especially me. Alright? I won’t go.”<br><br>Stephanie nodded. “Okay, good. You just stay here and watch over the rest of us while we’re sleeping. I don’t want anyone getting hurt.”<br><br>Jennifer nodded in agreement again, and Stephanie went back to the fire to keep Willow company while she",1
Shannon's paintings help her to deal with her grief and to find a new sense of purpose.,"<br><br>Shannon finished wiping away her tears and looked at the canvases on the floor. “I think I really will appreciate them more now, but I don’t know what to do next. Should I put them away or hang them on the wall first?”<br><br>Rosemary thought for a minute. “You can put them in your studio later on. Besides the attic room was getting crowded and now you have a whole other place to work! You can put them up there when you get ready to move each canvas. Right now, I think we should try and get the attic finished first.”<br><br>Shannon looked at the unfinished attic with some sadness. “I know you are right about the attic being too small and I am excited about my new studio, but I will miss working in my old attic. It is where I used to paint all the time with my mom. The attic always held so many memories for me and now that she is gone, I can’t bring myself to clean it out. I have left everything just the way it was.” Shannon moved around in the attic and picked up a few of her mother’s paintings. She put them back down before moving on.<br><br>Shannon’s heart was filled with sadness as she moved down the attic stairs. She had finished cleaning out the room and had started moving the furniture to the studio earlier that day. She had moved her easel and paints, but still hadn’t decided on what  to do about all of her mother’s paintings. The attic was the last room in the house that needed to be cleaned out and Shannon knew she would have to go up there soon no matter how hard it was.<br><br>Shannon put her head in her hands, overwhelmed with sadness and grief. She sat down on the bottom step of the stairs and started crying. “I just wish I had more time with you mom! You were so amazing and I miss you so much!” Shannon covered her face with her hands hoping she wouldn’t cry as hard if she couldn’t see her tears.<br><br>A few minutes later, Shannon heard a soft knock on the door. She quickly wiped her tears and stood up slowly. She opened the door to see her dad standing outside with several large boxes of pizza in his hands.<br><br>“Hey Shan, how are you doing?” He stepped into the room and set the pizza boxes down.<br><br>Shannon wrapped her arms around him and started crying again. “I miss her so much! I can’t believe she is gone!”<br><br>“I know it is hard honey. It gets easier every day, but it also makes a little harder because you miss her so much.” He patted Shannon on the back and looked over her shoulder to see that the floor was already cleared out and she was in the middle of painting.<br><br>“Hey sis!” came a cheerful voice from behind Shannon and she was greeted by the smiling face of her older sister Sara. She walked into the room and brought with her a comforting scent of lavender. “How are you holding up?”<br><br>“I am okay, just missing her so much! I still can’t believe she is gone!” Shannon  cried.<br><br>“It’s okay, we miss her too. But it is going to get better every day, and you will gradually learn to cope with it. You just need something to focus on, something positive that will make you happy. I think painting would be a great way to keep your mind busy, and do something productive to keep your mind off of her. I love seeing what you do Shannon! It brings back so many good memories from when we were kids,” Sara smiled. “You really have a talent there honey, don’t ever forget that!” Shannon felt a ray of hope from her sister’s words and it lifted her spirits. She was determined to prove that she was just as good an artist as her mother had been.<br><br>Shannon felt motivated by the praise. She felt a sense of determination to get better, and try to create more sophisticated paintings. Shannon looked at the brushes that she had gotten from her father’s art supplies, and noticed how much better they were than hers. They were expensive art brushes that had the best quality paint on them. They were much finer than the ones she had been using for her projects, and allowed for more intricate  details.<br><br>Shannon set up a small table in her space in the attic, and started to prepare her palette for a new painting. She felt comfortable and at peace with herself out there, away from the world. The paint that came with the brushes was very high quality, and she was thrilled about experimenting with it. Shannon wanted to try and emulate the style of her mom’s paintings, even if she didn’t quite have the talent and skill yet. She wanted to do it just for her mom, because she knew that her mom would be so proud of her. Shannon hoped that by doing this, she could somehow feel closer to her mother again.<br><br>Shannon wanted to create more beautiful, bigger paintings like the one that hung in her bedroom. They had all of her favorite things about the city; pictures of cars and skyscrapers, as well as various people in different clothes walking around. It was as if Shannon’s mom had known that she would love the city, even though she had never been there herself.",1
"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.","and we might be able to meet up more frequently. Do you want to go to NYC?”<br><br>Jenna shook her head in response as she replied, “If I go to Italy, I’ll have to talk with Antonia and Damian at some point. Why can’t I just go there and talk with them now?”<br><br>Liam shrugged his shoulders as he said, “I don’t know. She did say that you shouldn’t come back to the US for a while. This might have something to do with it. But if we don’t go, you won’t be able to help me in any way, because I can’t tell Antonia and Damian about being bitten by Dracula. Who knows what they are capable of doing?”<br><br>Jenna understood the danger that could be in store for Liam if he told anyone about his bite. She also knew that he was right – she wouldn’t be able to help him if she didn’t go to Italy. Getting back to her attacker was her only priority at this moment, and she had to do whatever it took. “Ok, I’ll go to NYC with you, but first we will have to talk with Randolph Howe. Once we are done, I’ll head off to Italy.”<br><br>Liam nodded in agreement as he said, “Deal!” Jenna was feeling happy that they were going to see Randolph Howe again; she liked him, and she trusted his knowledge of vampires.<br><br>They found the vampire community easily. It was still quite early when they arrived, so only a handful of people were walking about. Everybody seemed to be going about their business quietly and respectfully, which made for a very peaceful first impression. As they walked towards the community, Jenna felt a bit uneasy. It seemed like everyone had heard of her – there were many people looking at them as if they were some kind of celebrities.<br><br>It also seemed like everyone knew that she was missing, and had returned; most vampires around here looked surprised to see her. Some didn ’t seem as surprised, and Jenna recognized the looks on their faces. They were the faces of people who knew that she had been hurt, because they had been there when it happened.<br><br>Randolph was already sitting at his desk when they arrived at the community building, but he did stand up and greet Jenna. “Jenna, good to see you again!” He then reached out his hand to Liam. “And you must be Liam Cross?”<br><br>“Yes, sir, I am. I think we have met before?” Jenna noticed that Gregory Maldonado was sitting in the corner of the office, listening in.<br><br>“I don’t think so. But I do recognize you from pictures and stuff. You are Gregory Maldonado’s son, right?”<br><br>Gregory nodded quietly. “That is correct.”<br><br>Liam smiled at Gregory. It was a stiff smile, but he was trying to be polite. “Nice to meet you, sir.”<br><br>Gregory nodded back to him. “Likewise, Mr. Cross. Now, let us move into a private room; we can talk there.” Gregory Maldonado then stood up and gestured for them to follow him.<br><br>They moved into the next room, which was a rather large office with a large desk.<br><br>Gregory sat down behind the desk, and then gestured for them to sit across from him. “Now, let us move on to the reason why you are here. Jenna, I have heard through channels that you are trying to track down Gregory Maldonado’s son?”<br><br>“Yes sir, I am. He is guilty of several crimes that he has committed in Seattle and now in my  town. I want to know where he is so I can bring him to justice.”<br><br>Gregory Maldonado laughed quietly at her words. “Really? Do you truly think he will be brought to justice if you do find him?”<br><br>Liam was starting to get nervous at this conversation. It sounded like something was being set up here, but he didn’t know what it was.<br><br>Jenna gave Gregory an annoyed look. “I do, actually. I just need to find him first so that I can give the evidence I have to the FBI.”<br><br>“You are working for them now, and yet you want to turn your back on them? There is no need to do that. I have people that can help you track down his son, and then they will turn their attention to Antonia Rossi. She has a few people keeping an eye on the club tonight, but I am sure we can move it somewhere else for a night or two. But if we do that, then it would be better if we did it now, as opposed to later. If we wait too long, we will have a lot more eyes on us.<br><br>Liam was starting to get really nervous at this point. He moved a little closer to Jenna just in case he needed to shield her or something.<br><br>Jenna took a couple of seconds to think about this before speaking again. “Moving the club is okay with me, but moving it tonight might be a bad idea.”<br><br>“Moving it to somewhere safe is not a problem. Moving it to somewhere that our enemies can attack without fear of getting hurt would probably be a poor decision. Moving the club now might be an even worse idea though.”<br><br>This was starting to sound like moving the club was a bad idea no matter what.<br><br>Jenna looked over at Antonia. “Moving the club tonight is completely out of the question. We have a huge event tonight at Club Red, and everyone is looking forward to it. Why not move it to another club tomorrow?”<br><br>“Tomorrow night might be a better choice, anyway. If you move the club now, no one would know what or where the change was, and that could make matters even worse for you. You would then have to deal with the people who knew you might move the  club, as well as those who guessed right and chose to follow you there.”<br><br>Jenna looked at Antonia for a little while. This made sense, so she said, “I guess I could postpone the move until tomorrow. Yes, I will be sure that everyone knows what’s happening by the end of tonight.”<br><br>Antonia Rossi nodded a few times, and then said, “I would be happy to help with whatever you need when it comes to your attacker. I do not have much experience with that sort of thing, but I know others who may be able to help  me.”<br><br>Jenna sighed and said, “Okay. I appreciate that. But I have a feeling that the person who did this is going to be killed tonight, if they aren’t already.”<br><br>Antonia Rossi looked at Jenna for a long time and said, “What makes you think that? It seems that only Damian was seen leaving your alley, and he was arrested shortly thereafter.”<br><br>“I saw him leave my alleyway, but not after he assaulted me. He had a knife in his hand. I even got a good look at it, and I know that there’s no way that he could have killed me if he was holding it. He may have moved to the alleyway after he stabbed me, but did so much later. I’m not sure of the exact time frame, but it was definitely after the attack. And if he moved to my alleyway after the attack, then maybe he ran into Damian Henchman there, which is why he was arrested.”<br><br>Damian Henchman said, “Jenna, that is a possibility. Damian has already been questioned by the police about what happened to you. It is possible that they talked about moving to your alleyway. But why would you think that only one person was responsible for your attack?”<br><br>“Because I didn’t see anyone else that night. I didn’t hear anyone else, either. And I definitely didn’t feel anyone moving around me in the dark.”<br><br>Antonia piped up, “Jenna is right. She was moving around a lot with her superhuman speed and agility, and she would have noticed if someone was anywhere near her.”<br><br>“Well, I can tell you that someone was moving around, because I did feel something,” said Jenna. “But it was only one thing moving around me. For the most part, that thing just held still and waited for the right time to pounce. So I moved around a little bit myself to figure out what was going on, but then it moved in the same minute that I did. And then it just held still while I tried to fight back, and then it jumped on me, picked me up, and carried me away from wherever I was walking. Then it carried me over to the alleyway between your club and my apartment building. And then it  stabbed me, and I don’t really remember anything after that.”<br><br>Dread filled Jenna’s heart as she thought about everything she had been through. This was certainly the worst thing that had ever happened to her in her entire life, and yet it wasn’t even close to the worst attack that had been made against her.<br><br>All around them, everyone watched and listened intently.<br><br>“This is a very serious accusation you are making, Miss Riley,” said Judge White. “There is no proof that Damian Henchman is your attacker at all. You were found covered with blood in a back alley, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he attacked you there. In fact, it doesn’t even necessarily mean that he attacked you at all. The evidence will be presented tomorrow morning. Until then, Mr. Henchman will remain in custody here at the courthouse.”<br><br>Jenna nodded, and they exited the courtroom together. They moved to a separate room in the basement of the courthouse, a holding cell where they could speak privately and still be guarded by both security personnel and police officers. Judge White ordered security to escort both Jenna and Henchman into this room. They moved to the room, accompanied by four security guards and a detective who had worked on the case.<br><br>The courtroom was large and imposing. The holding cell was small and cramped. Jasper moved to one corner of it, opposite the door, while Damian moved to another corner opposite him. Jenna took up a position in the middle of the room, facing both men.<br><br>Jenna was standing very still, staring intently at Damian Henchman. It was clear that she had moved past being just angry to being downright furious with him now. She had stopped herself from attacking him, but only barely—she could feel that she was holding herself back by a thread of willpower alone.<br><br>Damian moved to the center of the room as well, facing Jenna. His face was clean-shaven now, and he did not look like himself at all. He looked smaller, more vulnerable than before. He moved to the center of the room, moving past a metal divider that separated Jenna from him.<br><br>Jenna moved to one side of the divider, away from Damian Henchman.<br><br>Damian looked at Jasper, then to one of the security officers in the room, gesturing with his head for them to leave. The security officer nodded and moved to the door, opening it and gesturing for the other three men to leave as well.<br><br>The detective lingered for a moment, looking first at Jenna, then at Damian. He hesitated, then moved to leave as well.<br><br>Jenna watched the men leave, then turned her attention back to Damian.<br><br>""You attacked me,"" she said, her voice low and dangerous. It was not a question.<br><br>Damian swallowed, but did not say anything. He looked away from Jenna's gaze.<br><br>""Why?"" Jenna asked. ""What did I ever do to you?""<br><br>Damian shook his head. ""You didn't do anything,"" he said. ""It wasn't personal.""<br><br>""Not personal?"" Jenna repeated, her voice incredulous. ""You nearly killed me, and you say it wasn't personal?""",1
Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"<br><br>Jenna looked around her. The room was filled with several beds and the odd piece of equipment. There were curtains on most of the windows, but one was wide open and showed a brick wall outside. She looked back at Liam before speaking again. “What’s your name?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam smiled at that. “My name is Liam Cross, and I promise that I will not hurt you, no matter what anyone else tells you.”<br><br>Jenna thought about things for a few more seconds before asking another question. “Does everyone become a vampire? Is that what this is?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam shook his head. “Most people don’t become vampires, and it is definitely not something that you want to happen to you,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna looked at him curiously before asking a question that she had been thinking about for the last several minutes. “Where am I? How did I get here?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam stared at her for a moment. “You are in the hospital,” said Liam, answering her second question first. “The police found you in an alley.”<br><br>Jenna looked at him to make sure he was telling the truth. She looked at the room around her, and then back at Liam. “Where is everyone else? I don’t see anyone else here,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam smiled for a moment before shaking his head. “You’re the only person here, right now, but the police are looking for other people who might have been with you at the time of your attack that they might have left behind. You were there quite a while before they found you, and you’re very lucky to be alive,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna looked around the room again, and then back at him. “I don’t understand what happened to me, but I feel like it was more than being attacked and left for dead in an alley,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam nodded for a moment before speaking again. “You are right about that, although I don’t know everything about what happened either,” said Liam. He pulled his jacket out from where he kept it under the chair by his bed, and handed it to  her. “When we meet someone for the first time, as is customary in our kind of society, we give them something small as a token of trust. I hope this isn’t too much for you to carry around with you,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna took the jacket from him and slipped it on. It fit her perfectly, almost as if it was made for her. “No, not at all. Thank you,” said Jenna as she smiled and looked back at him.<br><br>He nodded for a few minutes before speaking again. “I want to tell you something else that might answer some questions you have,” said Liam. “When a vampire is about to change, we experience a few events that give us more insight into what is coming. You were probably going through this and may have not realized it, or just forgot about it. When I saw you in the alley, I knew exactly who you were and what had just happened to you,” said Liam as he leaned back more comfortably into his chair.<br><br>Jenna leaned forward slightly in her seat as she listened intently to what he was saying. She took a moment to think about what he said and decided to ask him a question as she leaned back in her chair. “In other words, you knew I was going to turn into a vampire,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam looked up at the ceiling for a few seconds, and then looked back at her. “Yes, that is sort of what I’m saying. We all go through this when we are about to change,” he said as he looked back over at the front door.<br><br>Jenna shifted her eyes from one side of the room to another as she thought about how Elijah Sedgew ick might take what Liam was saying. She turned to look at the clock on the wall as she realized that it was late, and Elijah would be coming in soon if he wasn’t there already.<br><br>She turned away from the clock and back at Liam, who was still watching her carefully. “Where did you say you met each other?” asked Jenna as she shifted her weight in the chair.<br><br>“We met on the train to New York,” he said with a slight nod of his head. “I had just gotten on board and sat down in a seat next to you, as I was already quite tired from the trip up from Virginia. When I sat down you turned to look at me, and then took your phone out of your pocket and started typing away.”<br><br>Jenna listened as Liam spoke about their first meeting, but was having trouble picturing it in her mind. “Wait a minute,” she said as she looked at the clock and then back at Liam. “Are you saying that I got on this train by myself? When you first walked in here, I thought that I had been taken over by a vampire or something.”<br><br>Liam nodded. “Yes, and I know why you would think that. It is one of the things that leads up to a vampire’s transformation. They feel as if they are not traveling alone and have company with them on their journey, but when they look around they realize that no one else is there.”<br><br>Jenna nodded her head slowly trying to absorb everything Liam was telling her. “So that’s why I thought there was someone else in here with me?”<br><br>He nodded again. “It is possible because you were heading to New York, and I know that Antonia Rossi lives in New York. She is a very powerful vampire. She is the only person right now who holds the allegiance of most of the vampires in this country. She holds sway over a large number of vampires, both here and abroad. Every vampire who has turned to her for protection has been transformed into her kind. You have to go to New York and find her. She will be able to help you.”<br><br>Jenna moved away from the door, turning her back on Liam as she slid down until she was sitting on the floor in front of one of the seats. “New York ? What about Liam? I thought he was going with me.”<br><br>He shook his head solemnly. “I wish that I could, Jenna, but I can’t. Antonia is very powerful and has vast connections to all sorts of dark forces. If she finds out about me, then they will know that I am here. There wouldn’t be any point in traveling to NYC and going to her if she finds out that I am here. She would come looking for me immediately and, in the process, she would kill you.”<br><br>Jenna closed her eyes as she sighed heavily with resignation. “What’s the connection between Damian Henchman and Antonia? Why is he important to her?”<br><br>Liam looked at Jenna with a solemn expression as he said, “Damian is a vampire who has been to Italy recently. I think that you should go to Italy and find out if there are any clues to help you about your attacker. You could try New York first, but I think that it would be better if you went to Italy because it is less far away. Plus, it is closer to home for you",1
Trevor Lockwood ends up being a serial killer who lures women to their death and Natalie narrowly escapes becoming his next victim .,"to realize that she had been played. Trevor had lured her out to his home under false pretenses with the hopes that she would sleep with him. Natalie figured that he might have been trying to rape her, since she was stuck out in the middle of nowhere with no means of escape and a man who wanted to hurt her.<br><br>After a few weeks, Natalie moved to a city close by. She never told anyone about what Trevor Lockwood had done to her, not even her closest friends. She was ashamed of what had happened to her and she thought people would think less of her if they knew that she had slept with a man in order to get money. She had played Trevor Lockwood and now she felt like he was playing her, this time by trying to lure her into his home where he could kill her.<br><br>Natalie Harper’s home was a modest one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of a city. She had moved to the city so that she could get a job at a grocery store closer to her home.<br><br>She moved in with some friends from her hometown, but three months later she found herself living alone again due to disagreements over money and rent with her roommates. She had found the apartment after being referred there by  the manager at a local grocery store where she worked.<br><br>Natalie had been working as a cashier at the grocery store for about two months when she ran into Trevor Lockwood again, who wanted to set up another meeting with her. Natalie declined. Trevor persisted, sending Natalie emails that were rude and pushy.<br><br>Eventually Natalie changed her mind, realizing that she needed the money to pay her bills. Trevor Lockwood had offered her a job working as a model for his modeling agency. She was reluctant at first but decided to give it a try because it paid well and she would be able to quit her job at the grocery store, which Natalie realized that she didn’t care much for.<br><br>Natalie agreed to meet Trevor Lockwood at a local restaurant and discuss the offer in person.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was a handsome young man with bright eyes and short dark hair. He was about twenty-seven years old Natalie guessed, though she couldn’t be sure. Trevor Lockwood had a confident air about him. He was very persuasive and knew how to work people, Natalie observed. And he seemed like he could be dangerous if provoked, she thought. He definitely wasn’t someone she wanted to cross. But  the money sounded too good to pass up.<br><br>When Natalie arrived at the restaurant, Trevor Lockwood was already sitting at a table, alone. He greeted her with a smile and some small talk about the weather. It was unusually cold and snowing outside for this time of year. Natalie pulled aside her coat to  reveal a tight black dress underneath. The dress was mostly sheer and showed off Natalie’s ample cleavage.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood smiled appreciatively, his eyes taking in every inch of Natalie’s body, lingering on her breasts. After glancing down at her cleavage a few more times Natalie finally pulled the coat back over her chest and pretended to be interested in a news article she had retrieved from the check-stand rack. Trevor Lockwood’s eyes kept darting back to Natalie’s chest, his face flushed with arousal.<br><br>Natalie looked up at Trevor Lockwood and smiled coyly, knowing that she was getting to him. Trevor Lockwood responded by scooting closer to her on the bench seat of his booth. Natalie moved back slightly so that their knees weren’t touching and waited for Trevor Lockwood to continue.<br><br>After some more small talk about Natalie struggling to make rent",1
A group of survivors find themselves in a strange new world where they must band together to survive the perils that await them.,"light in the corner of his eye. He turned to look and saw something he’d never seen before. He saw a man with long, white hair and a tail like a fox standing at the edge of the forest. He wore nothing but a loincloth and had tattoos on his face and chest. The man seemed to be walking up to him.<br><br>	When the man was just about to reach Kain, he disappeared. Kain was shocked by this and quickly finished his prayer. He put his hands back down at his side as he was told to do and he looked around the area where the man had been standing but found no one there. He felt scared and confused. He wondered what could have happened to the man. Had he been taken up into the heavens by the gods? Could there be something else out there besides the gods?<br><br>	Kain began to walk back towards his house where he had left his family, when he suddenly fell to his knees. A sharp pain shot through his chest. The pain was so intense that it was almost unbearable and he could feel himself falling to the ground. He wanted to scream out in pain, but couldn’t muster the strength.<br><br>	His eyes rolled into the back of his head as he began to pass out. His world faded away, until he couldn’t see anything at all.<br><br>When Kain regained consciousness, he found himself lying in a bed in a strange room that he didn’t know was there. He had no idea how he’d gotten there and his head ached from the blow he had taken to the head. He slowly got up and looked around the room. It was strange for him to see so many people in one place. He suddenly felt self-conscious and looked away. As he looked at the people around him, he noticed that there were a lot of strange people in the room. Some of them even had tails like the one that he had seen in his vision earlier.<br><br>	There was a man dressed in white robes sitting at the head of the bed. Kain approached him cautiously and asked, “Where am I?”<br><br>	“You are in a healing chamber. You are a very ill young man. So far, we’ve been able to heal you of your illness, but it’s left you somewhat weakened and your mind is very confused. You have no idea how you got here do you?”<br><br>	“No, I don’t. I suddenly found myself there when I woke up.”<br><br>	“Please, don’t be afraid. We are not evil people. On the contrary, we are trying to save the world and all of the people in it. Are you familiar with a cataclysmic event that occurred about 500 years ago?”<br><br>	“Yes, I am. It was a very tragic day indeed, but it happened so long ago that I thought we’d gotten past it as a society.”<br><br>	“We have not gotten past it. The people of the world still live in fear and are constantly trying to find a way to leave the horrors of their lives. We, however, are doing everything in our power to help them and save the world.”<br><br>	“I don’t know what to say. I simply want to go home.”<br><br>	The man in white nodded understandingly, “If you wish for this, we can help you. It may take some time however. In order for us to heal you fully, you must first be brought back up to full strength and then we will begin the process of bringing you home.”<br><br>	Kain looked at the man questioningly, “How can you do this? I don’t understand how anyone could possibly help me like this. This is all too much to take in at once.”<br><br>	The man raised his hand and gestured for Kain to wait a moment. He reached over to a small table and picked up a dark blue colored stone that he held up in front of Kain’s eyes. There was a bright white light that surrounded the stone when it was held in front of his eyes. The light was so intense that Kain had to try hard not to close them.<br><br>	When the stone was removed from his eyes, Kain suddenly felt stronger. He could feel the strength returning to his legs and he walked over to the side of the bed and leaned against it. He looked at the man standing in front of him.<br><br>	“What is that? Where did you get that?”<br><br>	The man sighed, “I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you where it came from, but I can tell you what it is. That is a stone of truth. It will tell you the truth about anything that you need to know. I want you to look at it and tell me where you think you are.”<br><br>	Kain looked into the stone and saw his bedroom back in the city. He saw the image of himself lying in the bed with the strange people looking at him. He closed his eyes and reopened them again. He saw himself standing outside of his house looking at the city. When he closed his eyes a third time, he could see himself standing in the middle of the street looking around. He opened his eyes and looked at the man again.<br><br>	“I don’t get it! Where is this place? This can’t be real!”<br><br>	The man waited a moment and then said, “It is very real, and it is called Paradia. This is the world you live in now. We’ve all been waiting for you.”<br><br>	Kain turned to look around his surroundings again and said, “I don’t understand. I can’t be in this place. It’s impossible.”<br><br>	The man looked sympathetic towards Kain and said, “It will take time for you to understand what has happened, but I",0
Aimee confides in Kyle about her fear of being alone and her struggles to find someone who understands her.,"got to her apartment, she asked me in for a cup of coffee, and I agreed. We talked for hours, and by the time we had finished our coffee, she had told me her entire life story.”<br><br>She nodded approvingly. “And then?”<br><br>He raised his eyebrows and smiled at her. “And then, she invited me inside for a glass of wine. And then she invited me inside for a glass of wine. And then… well, I think you get the idea!”<br><br>She was laughing so hard that she had to wipe tears from her eyes. She slapped him on the arm and demanded the rest of his story. “Well, you’re going to have to tell me how it ended!”<br><br>He grinned at her and gave her a quick summary of how he met his wife, and how they eventually got married. He told her about how they settled down in a small town near his wife’s hometown. He told her about their children and the little sports they played. He told her about the parties that they threw for their friends and family, and the fun they had on the weekends. Finally, he smiled at her across the table and asked, “So, do you have a story to tell me?”<br><br>She giggled and shook her head. “No, not really! I was married once, but it didn’t work out. I tried dating a couple of times, but I just wasn’t interested.”<br><br>He nodded slowly. “Really? What happened?”<br><br>She shrugged nonchalantly. “It just never worked out. I always ended up breaking up with the guy when I realized that he wasn’t right for me.”<br><br>He nodded slowly and looked down at the table. “And now, you don’t feel like you need anyone?”<br><br>She shook her head and looked down at the table. “Not really! I mean, I like men, but they never seem to be able to get under my skin.”<br><br>He smiled wistfully and nodded slowly. “I know what you mean. That’s how I was with women for so long! It’s hard to find someone who really understands you, and when you finally do, you know that you’ve found the right one.”<br><br>She looked up at him and smiled. “Yeah, I think I understand what you mean! I know that I was never able to get close to a guy. It was like he had this shield, and I could never get past it.”<br><br>He chuckled and shook his head. “Yeah, I know exactly what you mean! It’s like they have this wall around them. You can see right through them, but you just can’t seem to break through that barrier.”<br><br>She nodded and laughed softly. “Yeah, that’s it exactly! It feels like they know you, but you don’t really know them. When you finally do, there’s something that seems… off.”<br><br>He nodded slowly and looked down at the table. “Exactly! And when you finally decide that you can’t do it anymore, you end up alone again. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to spend the rest of my life alone! It gets lonely and boring without someone to come home to after a long day of work.”<br><br>She chuckled and nodded. “Yeah, I know what you mean! It gets so boring to spend your nights alone. You have to do something to keep from going insane!”<br><br>He smiled at her and nodded slowly. “That’s why I started going to the bars after work. I found that it was the best way to stay sane and not go crazy!”<br><br>She snickered at him and rolled her eyes. “Oh, don’t be ridiculous! It’s not like you have to drink yourself drunk every night in order to get by!”<br><br>He rolled his eyes at her and grinned. “Well, no, but I found that it helps to be able to talk to someone who doesn’t know anything about you except what you tell them.”<br><br>She nodded and opened her mouth to speak, then suddenly stopped. She stared at him with big eyes, and he looked down at his food. He slowly smiled at her and asked, “What is it? What have you just realized?”<br><br>She stared at him, her eyes wide. “Oh my god! You’re right! That is exactly what I’ve just realized! I’ve been trying to find someone who understands me, but no one can ever get through that wall! But that’s not true when you meet another woman!”<br><br>He nodded slowly and leaned forward. “And that’s why I’m here with you now. Because you understand me!”<br><br>She smiled brightly and nodded slowly. “Yes, I understand you. And you understand me, too!” She laughed aloud and threw her arms around him. “What are you doing here, Kyle? This is the best thing that’s ever happened to me!”<br><br>He laughed softly as well and leaned forward to hug her tightly. She felt so warm and wonderful, and he realized that he had found what he had been looking for all this time.<br><br>He couldn’t believe that he had found the right woman, and at the same time, he was happy that he had. He had found someone who really knew him and cared for him. Someone who would make him happier than he had ever been before.<br><br>He couldn’t wait to come home to her every night. She already felt like home",0
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"<br><br>Gabriel had a gas oven with two burners, so he could only bake one item at a time. He had to make sure that he left enough space between each item to be able to open the oven door and remove the finished dish without having to move any other dishes. He needed a lot of freezer space because he could only store a few items in his refrigerator at a time.<br><br>Gabriel had lived on his own before, so he knew how to cook simple meals. But now, Gabriel was living on his own for the first time, and he was learning how to cook more fancy dishes. He moved into his tiny apartment with a small kitchen, so he had to learn to get creative.<br><br>Gabriel was originally from a small town in Colorado, where there were many scenic hiking trails and biking routes. However, Gabriel was in the city now, where there were not many hiking or biking trails nearby. Gabriel liked going to the local park and jogging on the paved trails. Gabriel lived close to the beach, where he enjoyed hanging out at the boardwalk with his friends. Gabriel was doing all of these things to keep himself busy and stay active while he looked for a job.<br><br>Gabriel had a big social circle, since he attended college in a large city, where he met many people from all over the world. Gabriel stayed in touch with these people, and it was nice to have a support network of friends when moving to a new city. Gabriel had some family members who lived nearby. Gabriel moved closer to them so that they could take care of him if he ever needed anything.<br><br>Gabriel started looking for a job right away, but he had no luck at first. Gabriel was unsure what kind of job to be looking for because he did not have enough experience in any one field yet.  There was a period of time when Gabriel could not find a job. Gabriel did not like living off of his savings, but he had to use them until he could find a job. Gabriel’s parents wanted him to stay on their health insurance plan back home, since it was cheaper. Gabriel still paid rent and bills in the city where he lived. Gabriel did not want to fall behind in paying his bills.<br><br>Once Gabriel found a job, he earned enough money to pay his expenses easily without having to rely on his savings. Gabriel made enough money to visit the local bars and clubs with his friends, but he did not  go out as much as they did. Gabriel had a girlfriend now, and he wanted to spend more time with her instead of his other friends.<br><br>Gabriel started dating Lina Sanchez. He met her at one of the places where he had gone out with his friends in the past few weeks. Lina Sanchez was Gabriel’s friend’s ex-girlfriend, but she became his girlfriend after a while.<br><br>Lina Sanchez was Gabriel’s first girlfriend from a different culture. She was from Italy, and she studied creative writing at a local university in Denver. She came to America when she was nineteen years old. Gabriel met her when he was twenty years old.<br><br>Gabriel met her at a bar where Lina Sanchez used to go with her family. Her parents owned the restaurant, and they were there most of the time. They spoke Italian and English with their customers when they ate there. Gabriel met Lina Sanchez while he was out with his friends drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.<br><br>Gabriel met her because she was a beautiful girl. She had dark brown eyes, brunette hair, and olive skin. She had a slender body and long black hair that reached down to her waistline.  She always wore fashionable clothes, and she looked like a Hollywood actress.<br><br>They started to get closer after a few weeks. Gabriel walked her home one night, and they kissed each other in front of the restaurant while Lina Sanchez’s parents were watching. They did not do anything else that night, but they started to date after that. They went on many dates, and Gabriel met her parents after a few months.<br><br>Gabriel felt like he was dating an older woman from the beginning of their relationship because she was nineteen years old when they met, and Gabriel was only twenty years old when they started dating.  He thought that he acted more mature than she did, and he considered himself to be a more grown-up person than she was.<br><br>After almost two years together, they moved in together into a little apartment. They were officially boyfriend and girlfriend, but they still acted as if they were children living at home with their parents. When they moved into the apartment, Gabriel had a lot of stuff that he brought from his parents’ house. He also had some books and other items that he bought for his apartment. He had to rearrange all of them because there was not much space in the small room.<br><br>They went out many times during the next couple of weeks, and Gabriel’s friends were visiting the apartment often to meet his girlfriend. They started to talk about relationship problems when they were bored, so for a couple of hours Gabriel and Lina talked about their relationship issues. They seemed to work through some of them when they moved in together.<br><br>Gabriel felt that he needed to be more mature, and he thought that he was not ready for this kind of responsibility after only two years together with her. He was worried that they were growing apart, but he did not know how to express these feelings to her. <br><br>He did not feel like a grown-up yet. He continued to ask his parents for money now and then, even though he was twenty years old and had a steady job. He would not stop talking about his parents when they visited the apartment, even though he lived there for almost two months already. Gabriel felt that he was still a teenager, but his behavior did not help him feel like an independent man in a relationship with a young woman.<br><br>Gabriel started to feel that he was in love with Lina because she seemed to be the best thing that happened to him lately. She was better than his new apartment, and better than his new job, but Gabriel started to feel that this was not enough for a happy relationship. He wanted more; he wanted to feel responsible and independent.<br><br>Gabriel decided that he was going to talk about this issue with her. He felt guilty and afraid at the same time; it was not easy to face the idea that they might not be on the same page anymore.",1

Gabriel quickly learns that apartment living comes with its own set of challenges.,"There was some cereal in the cupboard, so I had a bowl of that. After I finished, I started working on my computer.<br><br>I’d been trying to find a job for a few weeks, but had been having trouble finding anything that fit my qualifications. Unemployment rates were very high and the chances of finding work looked slim.<br><br>I put in resumes and cover letters to several jobs, but found no success. I was starting to get discouraged about the job search, and wondered if I had made a mistake by moving out. I knew that I would face some challenges starting off on my own, but I hadn’t expected this much trouble.<br><br>I finished with the computer and moved on to other tasks around the apartment. I cleaned up a bit and then went outside to get some groceries. I loaded up on some basic food items, then headed back inside of my new home.<br><br>I went to work for the rest of the week, trying to stay busy in order to keep my mind from wandering. I was becoming more and more discouraged about finding a job, and was starting to get worried about where my next paycheck would come from.<br><br>Things had started to slow down at work, and I was worried that we were going to be next to be shut down. Nothing had been said to me yet, but I could tell that business was slowing down and we needed business in order to stay open.<br><br>I went home as usual on Friday after work and spent the evening in my apartment. I was getting bored and was about ready to go crazy if I didn’t find anything to do. I called up a few friends to see if they wanted to go out for the evening, but none of them could or would. I was starting to feel really lonely and decided to go out on my own.<br><br>I left the apartment early Saturday morning, grabbing my wallet and keys before heading out. I walked down to the local pub and found a seat at the bar. I ordered a drink and sat there for several hours, drinking and talking to a few of the people at the bar.<br><br>By the time midnight rolled around, I was feeling pretty drunk. I knew that my car was parked around the block, but instead of going there, I made my way home. I started getting tired as I walked through my neighborhood, but kept going in order to get to bed.<br><br>I took a few wrong turns, but finally found my apartment. I went to unlock the door, but it was locked. I looked down at my keys and realized that they didn’t have the key for this door. Frantically, I searched my pockets, but all of my keys were gone. I must have lost them when I was drunk earlier in the night.<br><br>I thought about what to do next. I could just break down the door, but I didn’t know much about repairing a broken door. Plus, I wasn’t sure how much that would cost me or who would be responsible for it. Instead, I decided to make my way back to the pub and try to get some help from there.<br><br>I made my way back to the pub, but it was closed. I looked over at the clock and saw that it was only three in the morning. I had no idea when the pub closed, but assumed it was earlier than that.<br><br>I walked down the street, trying to find a place to rest for a while. Even though it was early in the morning, there were still plenty of people out and around. I found a bench in front of an apartment building and sat down on it.<br><br>I started getting tired again, so I laid down on the bench and fell asleep. I don’t know how long I was asleep for, but it was still dark out when I woke up. I sat up and looked around, trying to find my bearings.<br><br>Finally, I was able to figure out that I was sitting in front of my own apartment building. There were a few cars in the parking lot, some of which I recognized as belonging to my new neighbors. I walked up to the door and tried unlocking it, but it was still locked.<br><br>I started feeling pretty worried at this point. I didn’t have any money to cover a locksmith and didn’t know what to do if someone showed up while I was waiting for the door to be broken down.<br><br>I decided that I didn’t want to wait for anything to happen, so I started kicking at the door. It was made of wood and didn’t take long for me to break the lock. Once the lock was broken, I pushed the door open and walked inside of my apartment.<br><br>My apartment was a mess, but I didn’t care. All I cared about was getting inside, locking the door, and getting rid of the feeling of being alone. I walked around for a few minutes, but didn’t see anything that I recognized as a door handle.<br><br>There were a few windows in the apartment, and one of them had a curtain in front of it. I grabbed the curtain and started pulling on it, hoping that it was a door. To my surprise, it was. I pulled hard and the door opened.<br><br>I walked through the door and saw that it led to a back room in my apartment. I had never been in this room before and didn’t even know that it was there. I walked through the room, which had a few boxes left over from the people who used to live there.<br><br>At the end of the room was a kitchen. Next to the kitchen was a staircase that led to downstairs. I walked down the stairs and into the living room.<br><br>The apartment looked pretty much like how it did when I moved in, but there were a few differences. For one thing, there were a few new pieces of furniture scattered around. For another, there was a table in front of the TV with several video games on it.<br><br>I looked around for a few minutes, but didn’t see any people in the apartment. I guess that my neighbors were not home at",0
"Natalie Harper makes a deal with Trevor Lockwood, a man she met online, to meet him in person in exchange for money so that she can pay her rent .","“How do I look?” Natalie Harper asked her reflection, staring at her hair in the mirror. She was just about to leave her apartment when her neighbor poked his head out of his door and said, “Hey Nat, you going out to get some new clothes today?” 	She was wearing one of her favorite outfits, a pair of jeans and a long sleeved shirt. She had gone to the same bar in her old clothes a few times and it wasn’t like she was on the prowl for someone to hook up with, but it would be nice to feel a little more attractive. She had been single for about two years now, and her flings were starting to become less frequent as she approached thirty. She didn’t want to have another relationship, she just wanted that intoxicating feeling of being desired by someone who wasn’t a sex crazed maniac, which was pretty much every guy she had ever met. She shook her head at her reflection. Why was she even trying? Who cares what I look like? I’m not trying to pick up a guy, I’m just trying to make a little extra money, that’s it. She sighed and grabbed her purse from the counter. “I’m going out to run some errands,” she told her neighbor as she stepped out the door and locked it behind her.<br><br>It was a little after noon, and it was already starting to get hot, or at least it felt hot to Natalie. She pulled her thin cardigan closer around her body as she made her way to the mall. She had to get an outfit for dinner tonight with the CEO of a company that was interested in buying the game she had been working on for the last three years. It wasn’t that she didn’t like her job, it was just boring. Working with a team was nice, and she got along with everyone, but she worked from home so there was no real socializing unless they went out for drinks after work, which they did about once a month. She had tried to take a lunch break with the boys, but they all met up at a bar called ‘The Dive’ which didn’t really seem like her scene. She wasn’t really a fan of drinking, it made her feel bloated and sleepy, so she had stopped altogether when she had turned twenty five. Besides, she had spent most of her twenties drinking, and she had come out of it with only one real relationship, and a whole bunch of regret and awkward one night stands.<br><br>She arrived at the mall and parked her car in the same spot as she had always parked. She hated driving, so whenever she went somewhere she would always take the bus. It was cheap and it saved her from having to change clothes after work before going on a date. She took a few deep breaths before getting out of her car. I can do this, I can do this, she told herself as she walked into the mall and started heading for the large Forever 21 store.<br><br>Once she was in the store she went straight to the back, where the clothes were all sorted by size. “Okay, well I’m a six in jeans…” Natalie said out loud to herself. She looked at the section marked ‘6’ and grabbed a pair of skinny jeans and a loose fitting tee shirt. She was about to make her way to the dressing room when she heard someone say, “Thank you.” She whirled around almost knocking a rack of clothing over. For a split second she thought it might be her boss, but when she saw the stranger in front of her she knew it wasn’t. His skin was slightly tanned, his hair was a light brown and cut short, and he was wearing a black button down shirt, and a pair of dark jeans. He just stood there, looking at her. “You work here?” she asked him, not blinking as she looked into his eyes.<br><br>I have always wanted to write about things I don’t know much about. So this week I am going to try and write a story that is not based on any of my own personal experience. I chose zombies because I find the idea of zombies fascinating but have no real knowledge of how they work so this week I am writing a story about a zombie apocalypse.</s>I can relate. I don’t have a lot of friends either. My family is my only support system and it’s hard when you need help but no one is available to provide it<br><br>When i try to talk about it they just think im overreacting, or think im overthinking things. They dont understand that i cant just stop thinking about it</s>It really looks like that’s the best way they could do it without making a mess<br><br>yeah, I wouldn’t want to watch them make it</s>What a nice post. I hope you are doing well, and the family is happy.<br><br>Thank you for your kind words :)</s>I recommend not.  I would much rather read a good book than watch a movie about it.  It rarely lives up to the book and it usually leaves out something I thought was important.<br><br>I can agree with that, but every once in a while they do well.</s>They already had him in a few episodes of season 6. If I remember correctly all three of them, him, ~~David~~ and that other guy I can never quite remember, had small roles in multiple episodes.<br><br>David is one of the main character of the show. And he was only in one episode. All three of the main characters were in that episode except for Ted, Robin and Barney.<br><br>Ah your right my bad. I think I was getting him confused with the other guy who was in that episode with John Lithgow.<br><br>That would be David Lechter, who is not a main character either.<br><br>Ah you are right, my mistake.</s>I don’t think we’ll see it as a headline game but I’d be shocked if it wasn’t somewhere in",0
"Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.","else where it is warm and has green fields?”<br><br>Jack shrugged his shoulders. “It’s just the first place that came to mind, Eliza. I don’t want to be here anymore. It reminds me of you too much, and I can’t stand the thought of that.”<br><br>Eliza moved closer to him again.<br><br>“It reminds you of me? You know, Jack, I may be dead, but I can still feel your touch on my skin. I can still feel our bodies pressing together and how strong you were when you made love to me.”<br><br>Jack moved closer to her again, as close as the grave would allow him, and looked into her eyes.<br><br>Jack stared at her for a long moment before saying anything to her. He could feel his heart beat faster as he looked into her beautiful blue eyes and listened to her soft voice.<br><br>“I moved to this place because of you, Eliza. I can’t be here anymore because it is where you died, and that is where I will always remember you. That is where everyone will remember you, and nothing could be more painful than that.”<br><br>Eliza moved her cheek to Jack’s hand while he was still speaking, and she moved her body so that they were pressed against each other.<br><br>“Moving to a new place won’t lessen the pain of losing me, Jack. It won’t make our memories fade away. Moving to a new place – anywhere – will only be a way for you to forget me.”<br><br>Jack moved his hand away from Eliza’s cheek and he placed it on the top of her gravestone. “Moving will be a way for me to get my life back,” he said as he moved his other hand to the gravestone on the other side of Eliza’s grave. “Moving is a way for us to be together again.”<br><br>Eliza could tell that Jack was getting upset with her and she moved her head away from his hand so that she could move to the other side of the gravestone. “It will never be like it used to be,” she said.<br><br>Jack moved closer to Eliza so that they were standing right next to each other once again. “Moving will make it better,” he said as  he reached out to hold her hand.<br><br>Eliza could feel the warmth coming from Jack’s body as his hand reached for hers and she pulled away from him before they touched. “I don’t want you to forget me, Jack,” she said. “I love you and I need you.”<br><br>Jack tried to talk to Eliza once again, but she didn’t say anything and he turned his head so that he could see her face as she looked at him coldly.<br><br>“You just need to get on with your life, Jack,” she said as she took a step away from him. “This is all I can do for you now.”<br><br>Jack tried to talk to her again but Eliza didn’t say anything and she disappeared before he could get a good look at her face. Jack tried to grasp for her hand but she was gone and he stared at the spot where she had stood, trying to understand what was going on.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost had been standing right next to Jack in the graveyard when she spoke to him, but there was no sign of her when he looked  around. He knew that she had gone somewhere because he could feel her presence, but he couldn’t see her any longer.<br><br>Jack walked around the gravestones and looked carefully amongst the grass as if Eliza would suddenly appear and tell him that none of this was real and that he had been dreaming all of it. He couldn’t find Eliza anywhere and she didn’t say anything as he searched, but she did nothing to stop him either.<br><br>It was clear to him that she couldn’t see him any more either. She looked like a ghost to everyone else, but her eyes were open and her ghostly appearance wasn’t accompanied by a translucent white glow like what he had seen in Halloween movies. She was just invisible to everyone except for Jack.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack walked around the graveyard, but he could tell that she was happy with how things had turned out. Eliza’s ghost had been one of the nicest ghosts that he ever knew, and it was wonderful to see her again. She deserved a happy ending and so did he. She didn’t say anything at all during their time in the graveyard. <br><br>Jack watched her for a while longer and then he went over to his car. There was a lot that he wanted to do in the days ahead, but there was also a lot of unfinished business that had to be taken care of before that could happen. Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack got into his car, but she was looking at him again.<br><br>Jack wanted to tell her how much he appreciated what she had done for him after he had lost her. He wanted to thank her and ask her if there was any way that she could finish the job so that he wouldn’t have to let go. Jack wanted to tell her that she had done enough and that it was time for him to move on with the rest of his life. He wanted Eliza’s ghost to know that she didn’t have to be invisible any longer, and that she didn’t have to let go.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Eliza, please don’t leave me alone. Let go of me!”<br><br>Eliza said nothing at all.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Let go of me! Let me go! Let go! Please let me go!”<br><br>Jack tried to hold on to her, but she was gone.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost told him not to fight it and asked Jack to let go of what he was holding onto and then move on with his life. Jack asked her why, and Eliza told Jack that she wanted him to let go so that she could finally let go of him.<br><br>Jack’s ghost told Eliza that he didn’t want to move on. He didn’t want to let go of her. He didn’t want to live his  life without her. Eliza asked Jack what he would do if she stayed.<br><br>Jack said to her, “I want you to stay.” He wanted some sort of assurance that the ghost in front of him was really there, and so he asked her to repeat the question.  More quietly this time, she asked again if he wanted her to stay. When Eliza repeated the question a third time, Jack said that he did want her to stay, and so she told him that if he really wanted her to stay then she would.<br><br>Jack took a step toward the gravestone and then stopped. Eliza’s grave, Jack thought with the sudden realization of what he was doing. He was going to visit Eliza’s grave. He wasn’t visiting her body; he was visiting her grave. He was burying her all over again, this time without a body to bury. Jack took another step toward Eliza’s grave and started to weep. “Please don’t go,” he said choking on his words. “Please don’t leave me. Please stay with me. Don’t go away again. Please don’t go away .”<br><br>Eliza said that she wouldn’t leave him and that she would never go away again, but Jack was already moving toward the gravestone. He stopped when he got there and slowly walked around the gravestone looking for her whistle, which Eliza always wore around her neck. With each whistle he blew, Jack felt a hole opening up in his chest.<br><br>Jack found Eliza’s whistle under a rose bush that grew by the gravestone. He picked the rose petals off of it and blew the whistle several times, but when he stopped blowing, he felt empty again. <br><br>Jack blew the whistle one last time and put it in his pocket. The whistle was cold in his hand, and it felt heavy with Eliza’s absence. Jack wiped the tears from his face, put on his coat and left the graveyard feeling as if all hope had been drained from him. He sat down on a park bench and looked up at the winter sky. Jack couldn’t stop thinking about Eliza, but he knew that she was right. It was time for him to let go of his past and move on with his life. But it didn’t mean that he had to like it.<br><br>Jack blew the whistle one more time, and then he put it in his pocket and left the park. He walked for a few blocks until he came to a small flower shop on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street and went inside. Jack bought mums, gardenias, geraniums, and roses and took them back to Eliza’s grave. He arranged the flowers around the base of the headstone and then sat down on the ground and leaned against it.<br><br>Jack stayed there until it started to get dark, and then he got up and brushed the dirt off of his hands. He looked at the headstone one last time and then turned and walked away.",1
Jennifer decides to leave her family and start a new life.,"Well, your daddy and I are getting divorced. You won’t live with us anymore - not right now. Mama will look after you for awhile.”<br><br>Lily twisted around on Jennifer’s lap to look up into her eyes. Her dark brown eyes were full of concern and confusion. “But, but where will we live?”<br><br>“You and me, baby girl - just you and me. We have our own house now.” Jennifer laughed awkwardly, wiping away tears that had begun to form in her eyes again. “Mama has a new job, too.”<br><br>Lily was confused. She didn’t understand what Jennifer was saying. “Where are we going to live? We don’t have a house – not yet. Are we going to live in an apartment?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled, then took a deep breath before she filled them in. “No honey,” she began. “We bought our own house. You know how much I told you I wanted a backyard for the two of us? Well, I got it! We now live in a cul-de-sac, right by the park. It’s a real pretty neighborhood with lots of trees. We even have a swing in our front yard to play on.”<br><br>Lily was starting to understand what Jennifer was talking about, but something still didn’t add up. “Mama, I don’t understand. You said we were going to live at Grandma Jackie’s house.”<br><br>Lily sat up straight and looked at her mama with tear-filled eyes. “Can’t we go to Grandma Jackie? I like it there. What about the park? Can we still go to the park?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled, trying to hide her own tears. “Of course we can! We just don’t live in the same house anymore. We are still a family, just a different kind of family. I still love you as much as ever.”<br><br>Lily nodded and wiped her eyes. “I know, mama,” she started. “It’s just that I didn’t think daddy would do something like that. It was all so sudden, too. Now he won ’t even talk to me.”<br><br>Jennifer put her arm around Lily and pulled her close. “He probably doesn’t know what to say. You should try talking to him some more. I bet he wants you as much as ever. It takes time to get used to the changes.”<br><br>Lily pulled away and looked at Jennifer with a questioning face. “What changes?” she asked, her tone turning sarcastic. “You mean when daddy sells the old house and mama moves out?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled. “Maybe we can still come over and visit,” she said, moving toward the door.<br><br>Jennifer opened the door and moved into the hallway. She turned back to look at her daughter and smiled warmly. “Yes! You can move in with me for a while,” she said, trying to sound optimistic.  “I have a new job and you can go to the same school, and we’ll see how it goes. You might like living with me just as much.”<br><br>Lily shrugged. She had never liked change, but didn’t really have an opinion on this one way or another. “I guess so,” she said doubtfully. But her expression clearly showed her reluctance if Jennifer had looked closely enough.<br><br>Jennifer stepped out the door and walked down the stairs to the sidewalk below. The moving van was parked in front of her house, ready to take her furniture away. She turned back toward the side of the house and waved at her daughter, who was standing there with a group of children.<br><br>“Good-bye!” Jennifer called. Then she turned and moved to the front door across the street, where a middle-aged man stood waiting on the porch.<br><br>“Are you moving in?” the man asked.<br><br>“Yes, I am,” Jennifer answered. “You are moving out?”<br><br>“Yes, I am, too. You don’t look familiar. Are you moving to this neighborhood?”<br><br>“No, I moved from one street over, but I just started a new job and decided to move closer. Moving is such a hassle!”<br><br>The moving man laughed lightly. “I know what you mean. But at least it will be easier moving the rest of your stuff. Moving the big pieces is the worst part.”<br><br>“That’s true, but I want to move all my furniture to the new house today instead of dragging it here tomorrow and back again on Wednesday,” Jennifer said. “This way, I can unpack right away. Do you move furniture often?”<br><br>“Every couple of months. I moved a lot when I was younger, but now I prefer to stay in one place for years at a time. It saves me money, and it gives me more stability with my job. My wife prefers the same thing because moving is hard on the relationship. But it depends on our jobs. We move more when we get transferred to another city or state. Moving is such a hassle, but the longer you stay in one place the harder it is to move on short notice. It can be hard finding a new place if you have to move  quickly.”<br><br>The moving man stopped and picked up a picture frame. He was looking at Jennifer’s pictures of Samantha and Theresa as children, then he replaced the frame on the wall.<br><br>“Yeah, we have two kids, so we may move again in the next few years,” Jennifer said. “But we probably won’t move for a while after this, unless my husband gets transferred again. He’s not getting any younger, so who knows? It’s just nice to not have to move right now. I need some stability after everything that has happened.”<br><br>The moving man smiled and nodded his head in agreement.<br><br>“Moving is a hassle, but at least you can choose where to put everything in the new place. I don’t move very often, but when I do, it is fun to rearrange my stuff and make the place feel more like home. Moving is definitely stressful though. It’s hard to make friends if you move too often because it takes people longer to get to know you.”<br><br>The moving man grunted in response.<br><br>“Some people move all the time, and have a different group of friends at each place they move to. That way, they don’t really have to make any new friends. They already have a group of friends waiting for them wherever they go. That way, they don’t have to go through what you just did. They can move quickly from one place to the next. Moving is easier that way, especially if you have a big family. You can’t move so quickly when you are only moving some of your things, or when you are just moving yourself. Moving can be really easy if you plan ahead. It can also be hard though if you don’t plan ahead, or things don’t go according to your plan. Moving can be a hassle and stressful at times, but it can also be a lot of fun. You just have to know how to dealwith moving stress and keep things from getting too overwhelming.”<br><br>Another moving man came out of the house. He carried a small wooden table and two dining chairs to a nearby truck.<br><br>The moving man, Jennifer, and the other moving men stood at the side of the house as they continued to load and unload boxes from the truck. They moved quickly but carefully , keeping the tables and couches from hitting the walls or scratching the floors. They managed to fit all of Jennifer’s furniture into her small SUV, which had been loaded to the roof with boxes only moments before.<br><br>“Don’t worry, my friend. Everyone has their own methods for moving. If you think it is the right way to do things, then you keep doing it that way. If you want to make sure that everything gets put into place exactly how you want it, then that is what you do. It’s all about figuring out how your mind works and what works best for you. As long as it keeps working and you don’t keep moving, then you have a good way of doing things!”<br><br>The moving men smiled and nodded at Jennifer. They moved to the back of the truck and finished loading all of the furniture. The moving men packed everything into the truck with incredible skill and expert timing.<br><br>Jennifer moved to the passenger’s side of the SUV and picked up her bags. She walked back to side the house and noticed that three of the moving men were busy carrying box after box into the house, while a fourth was watching them from side a doorway. The moving man turned to watch Jennifer get into the side of the SUV.<br><br>“Hey! Why don’t you move in with us? We have some extra space right now and it would be nice to have another girl around. You can move in with us for as long as you need to, and we can move you into a different room when someone else needs to move in. We’re moving into a huge apartment later on and we don’t know anyone else yet. We’ll make sure that you are taken care of, okay?”<br><br>Moving men moved to back of the truck, and got into their side. They drove off towards the other end of the block, moving their way through traffic. Moving men had already done their previous moves and were heading to side their next move. Moving men were moving a lot today and had many moves lined up.<br><br>Jennifer moved back to side the door and thought for a moment.<br><br>This is Side Bar. This is where Jennifer will make her decision regarding moving in with the three moving men.<br><br>“I don’t know,” she said. “It sounds like a lot of responsibility. I don’t want to be a burden.”<br><br>“Don’t worry about it, we can handle it. Just say yes and come with us!”<br><br>Jennifer thought for a moment longer and then made her decision.<br><br>“Yes, I’ll move in with you.",1

He knew that she had gone somewhere because he could feel her presence, but he couldn’t see her any longer.<br><br>Jack walked around the gravestones and looked carefully amongst the grass as if Eliza would suddenly appear and tell him that none of this was real and that he had been dreaming all of it. He couldn’t find Eliza anywhere and she didn’t say anything as he searched, but she did nothing to stop him either.<br><br>It was clear to him that she couldn’t see him any more either. She looked like a ghost to everyone else, but her eyes were open and her ghostly appearance wasn’t accompanied by a translucent white glow like what he had seen in Halloween movies. She was just invisible to everyone except for Jack.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack walked around the graveyard, but he could tell that she was happy with how things had turned out. Eliza’s ghost had been one of the nicest ghosts that he ever knew, and it was wonderful to see her again. She deserved a happy ending and so did he. She didn’t say anything at all during their time in the graveyard. <br><br>Jack watched her for a while longer and then he went over to his car. There was a lot that he wanted to do in the days ahead, but there was also a lot of unfinished business that had to be taken care of before that could happen. Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack got into his car, but she was looking at him again.<br><br>Jack wanted to tell her how much he appreciated what she had done for him after he had lost her. He wanted to thank her and ask her if there was any way that she could finish the job so that he wouldn’t have to let go. Jack wanted to tell her that she had done enough and that it was time for him to move on with the rest of his life. He wanted Eliza’s ghost to know that she didn’t have to be invisible any longer, and that she didn’t have to let go.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Eliza, please don’t leave me alone. Let go of me!”<br><br>Eliza said nothing at all.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Let go of me! Let me go! Let go! Please let me go!”<br><br>Jack tried to hold on to her, but she was gone.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost told him not to fight it and asked Jack to let go of what he was holding onto and then move on with his life. Jack asked her why, and Eliza told Jack that she wanted him to let go so that she could finally let go of him.<br><br>Jack’s ghost told Eliza that he didn’t want to move on. He didn’t want to let go of her. He didn’t want to live his  life without her. Eliza asked Jack what he would do if she stayed.<br><br>Jack said to her, “I want you to stay.” He wanted some sort of assurance that the ghost in front of him was really there, and so he asked her to repeat the question.  More quietly this time, she asked again if he wanted her to stay. When Eliza repeated the question a third time, Jack said that he did want her to stay, and so she told him that if he really wanted her to stay then she would.<br><br>Jack took a step toward the gravestone and then stopped. Eliza’s grave, Jack thought with the sudden realization of what he was doing. He was going to visit Eliza’s grave. He wasn’t visiting her body; he was visiting her grave. He was burying her all over again, this time without a body to bury. Jack took another step toward Eliza’s grave and started to weep. “Please don’t go,” he said choking on his words. “Please don’t leave me. Please stay with me. Don’t go away again. Please don’t go away .”<br><br>Eliza said that she wouldn’t leave him and that she would never go away again, but Jack was already moving toward the gravestone. He stopped when he got there and slowly walked around the gravestone looking for her whistle, which Eliza always wore around her neck. With each whistle he blew, Jack felt a hole opening up in his chest.<br><br>Jack found Eliza’s whistle under a rose bush that grew by the gravestone. He picked the rose petals off of it and blew the whistle several times, but when he stopped blowing, he felt empty again. <br><br>Jack blew the whistle one last time and put it in his pocket. The whistle was cold in his hand, and it felt heavy with Eliza’s absence. Jack wiped the tears from his face, put on his coat and left the graveyard feeling as if all hope had been drained from him. He sat down on a park bench and looked up at the winter sky. Jack couldn’t stop thinking about Eliza, but he knew that she was right. It was time for him to let go of his past and move on with his life. But it didn’t mean that he had to like it.<br><br>Jack blew the whistle one more time, and then he put it in his pocket and left the park. He walked for a few blocks until he came to a small flower shop on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street and went inside. Jack bought mums, gardenias, geraniums, and roses and took them back to Eliza’s grave. He arranged the flowers around the base of the headstone and then sat down on the ground and leaned against it.<br><br>Jack stayed there until it started to get dark, and then he got up and brushed the dirt off of his hands. He looked at the headstone one last time and then turned and walked away.",1
"With supplies running low and tensions high, the group must work together to find a way out before it's too late.","was at the table. Jennifer leaned against the wall next to the door and waited. It had been several hours and it was finally dark outside, which meant it would be safer for her to go out. She checked her compass one more time before heading out into the forest.<br><br>Jennifer moved quickly through the woods towards the stream. The trees were thick here, and it was easy to get lost in them. Without any landmarks, she couldn’t tell whether or not she was going the right way.<br><br>She reached down and pulled her shirt up over her nose to block out the smell of mildew that still lingered in the air. Jennifer moved as quickly as she could, but it was slow going in the dark.<br><br>The last thing she needed was to run into another group of survivors and have to fight them for what little they had now. It would be better if she found the stream on her own and moved in that direction. It wasn’t likely that there would be another house nearby, but it was possible.<br><br>Jennifer moved silently through the trees, moving slowly and carefully so as not to make any sound. She was walking through a small clearing when she heard something move behind her. She moved faster, but it was too late.<br><br>The group moved to the house. Jennifer had already been there and knew how to get in, so she let the others go first. They moved quietly through the woods until they reached a small clearing where they could see the stream and an old house. The house was about three hundred yards away, but it was dark out and there were trees everywhere, so it was hard to tell exactly how far away it was.<br><br>Moving closer to the house, she moved quickly around the side of the house so that she could check for signs of life. She came around the house to find a small building in the back left corner. Walking towards it, Jennifer moved slowly so as not to attract any attention from anyone who might be inside. She moved up and peeked into the window, only to see a dim light.<br><br>Moving slowly up to the door, Jennifer carefully tried opening it, moving slowly at first then using more force after a moment. The door creaked open just enough for her to slip through the crack. Moving slowly into the house, she saw that it was made of some kind of metal and glass. There was a large table in the middle of the room with chairs surrounding it.  She could not tell if anyone was inside, but there were some supplies on the table that she wanted to look at.<br><br>She moved over to the table and put her backpack on the ground, then opened it so she could take out her flashlight. She moved the light around until she found a bottle of bleach,  three packs of beef jerky with 12 pieces in each pack, and a small bag of Doritos. The food would not last for the entire group for very long, but it would give them something to eat for the next couple of days.<br><br>Moving back to the door, she tried pushing on it but it would not budge. She tapped the door several times, hoping someone was inside who could help her get out. After several more minutes of no response, she decided that they must have gone out through another door in the house. Putting her backpack on again, she headed to the other side of the house to find  another exit.<br><br>She walked down the hallway and turned a corner, but saw that it was blocked by debris that had fallen from a hole in the ceiling. She moved around the pile of bricks and wood until she found a door with a handle. The door opened, but instead of another hallway she was looking at several piles of rubble that had collapsed onto themselves.<br><br>Stephanie climbed over them and continued her way down the hall when she heard someone coming down the stairs behind her. She turned and prepared to run, but instead of another hostile group she saw a man carrying two cases of bottled water. He was tall, skinny, and muscular with black hair, brown eyes, and multiple tattoos on his arms.<br><br>The group had gathered all the supplies they could carry from the house and were preparing to leave when a man ran into the house.

Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"friends, and she had stopped taking part in the activities she used to enjoy doing in her spare time. Shannon was spending more time alone at home because her father didn’t seem interested in doing anything with her, and so it seemed as though she had no one else to turn to but herself. “She’s trying to cope with her loss, and I don’t think she’s learned to do that yet,” Uncle Jeff said.<br><br>Shannon was sitting on the edge of her bed, holding a box of oil paints that was given to her by her mother before she passed away from cancer. She started crying uncontrollably once again upon seeing both her uncle and father approach her room slowly. “What are you doing here?” Shannon asked, wiping the tears from her face and standing up. There were paint stains on her cheeks, nose and hands. Her uncle could see that she had been crying for a while.<br><br>“I came to talk to you,” her father said.<br><br>“About what?” Shannon asked, turning away from them. She started pacing around the room as she spoke. “You don’t care how I feel, so why should I tell you?” she asked.<br><br>Her father stepped inside the room and placed a hand on her shoulder. “I do care about how you feel daughter,” he said softly. Her uncle noticed that there were small tears forming in her father’s eyes.<br><br>“Yeah, right. If you did care, you wouldn’t have left us all behind to deal with this grief on our own,” she said, turning to face her father directly now. She looked in his eyes and saw that he had started crying now. “He doesn’t care.” She turned to face her uncle now. “You don’t care either, do you?”<br><br>Her uncle sighed and shook his head slowly. He did care, but he knew that she wouldn’t believe him just yet. “No, I do care Shannon,” he said gently.<br><br>She looked at him for a few moments while the tears continued to fall from her father’s eyes and then nodded and walked over to sit on her bed. The two men stood nearby, unsure of what to do next. Her father was crying now,  so he didn’t know how to handle this situation.<br><br>Shannon saw the box of oil paints on her nightstand. She picked it up and opened it slowly, letting the tears continue to stream down her face as she did so. She stared at the empty canvas in front of her for a few moments before she took out a large brush and dipped it into a small jar of red paint. Then, Shannon started to paint.<br><br>She started painting out of her own grief and loneliness, but as she worked, she found that somehow painting helped to ease it. She painted for hours and didn’t eat anything. Shannon’s need to paint became so strong that she decided to clear out her attic and turn it into a studio, so that she could paint there whenever she felt like it.<br><br>She turned her old wooden desk into a workbench and filled the walls with canvases, paints, brushes, and other painting materials. Shannon moved her easel to the center of the room and placed two chairs in front of it. She hung some potted plants in the corners of the room for decoration purposes. The attic was small, but she didn’t mind that. It was just right for her. It also reminded  her of the attic in the family’s old barn.<br><br>Shannon would spend hours in the studio, painting and listening to music on her headphones. She discovered that drawing people helped her to feel connected with her mother once more, and so she would draw portraits of her mother over and over again. The  act of drawing also helped Shannon to cope with her feelings.<br><br>Shannon started to put her own feelings into the paintings, too. She could often be found staring at one of her own unfinished paintings, which had two figures standing in a meadow. The figures were very dark and pale, reflecting Shannon’s feelings of being filled with darkness but also feeling a glimmer of light at the same time.<br><br>This painting became an outlet for Shannon and she would often sit and stare at it for long periods of time to try to work some of her pain and confusion out on it. Sometimes, she would cover the painted surface with salt and trace the outlines of her paintings in a faint blue wash. This felt like she was connecting with someone, especially since her own mother could no longer speak to her. Shannon felt as if she were having a conversation with her mother by painting the images over and over again. Shannon started to feel closer to her paintings and knew that they helped her to heal.<br><br>Shannon painted for hours every day, with only a short break for lunch which she always ate while standing up. She drank a lot of water so that she wouldn’t feel weak or tired. She felt almost as peaceful as when she was painting and felt that it was her therapy. Shannon painted every night until she finished a painting, and then she would start a new one. Sometimes, she would paint for six hours straight without stopping, and this helped to ease the pain in her heart. Sometimes, while painting, Shannon felt like",1
Gabriel quickly learns that apartment living comes with its own set of challenges.,"There was some cereal in the cupboard, so I had a bowl of that. After I finished, I started working on my computer.<br><br>I’d been trying to find a job for a few weeks, but had been having trouble finding anything that fit my qualifications. Unemployment rates were very high and the chances of finding work looked slim.<br><br>I put in resumes and cover letters to several jobs, but found no success. I was starting to get discouraged about the job search, and wondered if I had made a mistake by moving out. I knew that I would face some challenges starting off on my own, but I hadn’t expected this much trouble.<br><br>I finished with the computer and moved on to other tasks around the apartment. I cleaned up a bit and then went outside to get some groceries. I loaded up on some basic food items, then headed back inside of my new home.<br><br>I went to work for the rest of the week, trying to stay busy in order to keep my mind from wandering. I was becoming more and more discouraged about finding a job, and was starting to get worried about where my next paycheck would come from.<br><br>Things had started to slow down at work, and I was worried that we were going to be next to be shut down. Nothing had been said to me yet, but I could tell that business was slowing down and we needed business in order to stay open.<br><br>I went home as usual on Friday after work and spent the evening in my apartment. I was getting bored and was about ready to go crazy if I didn’t find anything to do. I called up a few friends to see if they wanted to go out for the evening, but none of them could or would. I was starting to feel really lonely and decided to go out on my own.<br><br>I left the apartment early Saturday morning, grabbing my wallet and keys before heading out. I walked down to the local pub and found a seat at the bar. I ordered a drink and sat there for several hours, drinking and talking to a few of the people at the bar.<br><br>By the time midnight rolled around, I was feeling pretty drunk. I knew that my car was parked around the block, but instead of going there, I made my way home. I started getting tired as I walked through my neighborhood, but kept going in order to get to bed.<br><br>I took a few wrong turns, but finally found my apartment. I went to unlock the door, but it was locked. I looked down at my keys and realized that they didn’t have the key for this door. Frantically, I searched my pockets, but all of my keys were gone. I must have lost them when I was drunk earlier in the night.<br><br>I thought about what to do next. I could just break down the door, but I didn’t know much about repairing a broken door. Plus, I wasn’t sure how much that would cost me or who would be responsible for it. Instead, I decided to make my way back to the pub and try to get some help from there.<br><br>I made my way back to the pub, but it was closed. I looked over at the clock and saw that it was only three in the morning. I had no idea when the pub closed, but assumed it was earlier than that.<br><br>I walked down the street, trying to find a place to rest for a while. Even though it was early in the morning, there were still plenty of people out and around. I found a bench in front of an apartment building and sat down on it.<br><br>I started getting tired again, so I laid down on the bench and fell asleep. I don’t know how long I was asleep for, but it was still dark out when I woke up. I sat up and looked around, trying to find my bearings.<br><br>Finally, I was able to figure out that I was sitting in front of my own apartment building. There were a few cars in the parking lot, some of which I recognized as belonging to my new neighbors. I walked up to the door and tried unlocking it, but it was still locked.<br><br>I started feeling pretty worried at this point. I didn’t have any money to cover a locksmith and didn’t know what to do if someone showed up while I was waiting for the door to be broken down.<br><br>I decided that I didn’t want to wait for anything to happen, so I started kicking at the door. It was made of wood and didn’t take long for me to break the lock. Once the lock was broken, I pushed the door open and walked inside of my apartment.<br><br>My apartment was a mess, but I didn’t care. All I cared about was getting inside, locking the door, and getting rid of the feeling of being alone. I walked around for a few minutes, but didn’t see anything that I recognized as a door handle.<br><br>There were a few windows in the apartment, and one of them had a curtain in front of it. I grabbed the curtain and started pulling on it, hoping that it was a door. To my surprise, it was. I pulled hard and the door opened.<br><br>I walked through the door and saw that it led to a back room in my apartment. I had never been in this room before and didn’t even know that it was there. I walked through the room, which had a few boxes left over from the people who used to live there.<br><br>At the end of the room was a kitchen. Next to the kitchen was a staircase that led to downstairs. I walked down the stairs and into the living room.<br><br>The apartment looked pretty much like how it did when I moved in, but there were a few differences. For one thing, there were a few new pieces of furniture scattered around. For another, there was a table in front of the TV with several video games on it.<br><br>I looked around for a few minutes, but didn’t see any people in the apartment. I guess that my neighbors were not home at",0
"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","The darkness enveloped Jenna Riley in a blanket of safety. She had just gotten home from her night shift at the local diner. Having worked in the kitchen made her skin and hands smell like grease, but it didn’t bother her. It was a sort of pungent aroma that she had grown to associate with the diner, not only that, but it was also a reminder and comfort of her hard-working, reliable personality.<br><br>Jenna’s dark blue jeep was parked in front of her small home on one of the main streets of Twin Peaks. A few houses down from hers was an abandoned factory. One could see the sign that read Twin Peaks High on top of it. It was surrounded by vacant lots and trees.<br><br>Jenna exited her car, locked the doors, and started walking up to her house. The light from her porch lamp shone down on her as she pushed the front door open and stepped inside. She set her purse on top of the kitchen counter and tossed her keys in a bowl on the shelf next to her front door.<br><br>“Hi mom,” Jenna called as she walked into the living room of her small five-room, two bedroom house.<br><br>Her mother turned around from the kitchen and gave her an encouraging smile. “Hey. How was work?” she asked.<br><br>“Tiring, but nothing new there.” Jenna took off her apron and tossed it on the counter.<br><br>Jenna turned around and faced her mother, who was now standing at the counter taking out some spaghetti noodles from a box. “It’s getting to be that time again when you have to start looking for a new job, isn’t it?”<br><br>Jenna shrugged and sat down on the couch. “Yeah, it is. Not sure if I want to go back to college or just find a different job.”<br><br>“I think you should try college. You always said that you wanted to become a lawyer. You don’t want to let that slip away,” her mother said.<br><br>Jenna nodded and started eating her food. Her mother walked back into the kitchen and continued making dinner. Jenna finished her meal shortly after and decided to go straight to bed since she had to get up early the next morning.<br><br>Jenna walked back into her bedroom and was about to go in when she heard something to the left of the door. Jenna stopped in her tracks and listened. She heard the scurrying of feet coming from outside her house. She slowly pressed her ear against the door and listened, straining her ears to hear. Jenna put a hand on the doorknob and turned it slowly so that she could keep her ear pressed against it.<br><br>Jenna heard the scurrying noise once again and turned her head slightly to make sure nobody was watching her. She slowly opened the door a crack and peeked out of it. A shadow moved past the side of the house. Jenna saw a pair of feet run past her door and head down towards the abandoned factory.<br><br>Jenna walked out of her house and followed the shadow to the factory. She walked towards it with a slow gait, making sure to keep to the shadows as well as she could. She stopped when she reached the trees surrounding the factory and looked around, making sure nobody was watching her.<br><br>A couple of seconds later, Jenna heard the scurrying noise again. She followed it to a corner of the factory and saw a figure sprint out of the corner. Jenna recognized the figure, and immediately felt anger welling up within her.<br><br>Jenna ducked down into the shadows and followed the figure as it ran around the factory. She tried to keep a close eye on it, but the figure kept darting around corners and behind walls. Jenna felt her anger grow as she followed the figure. It sprinted past a row of cars, and Jenna noticed that it was keeping to the shadows of the cars so that nobody could see it in its hiding place.<br><br>The figure stopped after a couple of minutes and looked around nervously. It held its breath for a moment and then took off once again. Jenna followed closely behind, keeping to the shadows.<br><br>A couple minutes later, the figure took off down a small alley that ran between two houses. Jenna followed quietly behind, making sure not to be seen by anybody.<br><br>When she reached the end of the alley, Jenna saw the figure stop and lean against the wall of a house. Jenna paused for a second as she stood in front of the house. She took her time looking around, making sure nobody was watching her. Satisfied that she was alone, Jenna continued around to the other side of the house, where the figure was waiting for her.<br><br>The figure had turned around and now stood in front of the wall with her back to Jenna. Jenna walked around to the front of the figure and stood next to it. The figure held its breath and looked around again. It then took off down the alley that Jenna had just come through. Jenna followed closely behind it, keeping to the shadows.<br><br>A couple of minutes later, the figure stopped in front of another house. It again leaned against the wall and looked around. When it seemed satisfied that nobody was watching, it took off down the alley once again. Jenna followed behind it, continuing to keep to the shadows as much as possible.<br><br>They ran past two more houses before reaching a dead end. At the end of the alley, a fence blocked their way. Jenna’s breath caught in her throat as she saw the figure go up to the fence and leap over it. Jenna looked around quickly to make sure nobody had seen it jump the fence. When she was satisfied that nobody had, she ran up to the fence and put her hands on it. Jenna jumped as far as she could and landed on top of the fence. She walked down to the ground and stood next to a trash can, trying to catch her breath.<br><br>Jenna heard the scurrying sound again and looked behind her. The figure",0

She knew that John Doe was gone.  Her only chance of surviving was in the morning, when she would be able to hear them.  They would probably take turns with her all night long.  She knew that she was going to die.<br><br>  “Oh,” she said, trying to stay calm.<br><br>  There was a pounding on the door.<br><br>  “Come in,” John Doe said from outside the basement door.<br><br>  It opened and closed again.<br><br>  The man and woman from the corner of the basement were brought into the room.<br><br>  She saw John Doe walk over to the man and cut his throat with a knife.<br><br>  He then went over to the woman and did the same thing.<br><br>  “You two have been very bad,” he said.<br><br>  They were both dead, but Valerie was still alive.  She was going to die tonight.<br><br>  He dragged her body over to the man and forced her head between his legs.<br><br>  Valerie tried to get up, but he was too strong for her.  She felt the knife come up under her chin and then saw a spray of blood.  When she looked up from the man’s legs, she saw that John Doe was holding the knife and looking right at her.<br><br>  “Don’t worry,” he said.  “I won’t kill you in front of your friends.  You have to leave this basement by dawn or else you will be my next trophy.  Don’t think that I won’t kill you.  I’m a serial killer.  Remember that.”<br><br>  He left, shutting the door behind him.<br><br>  “Ah!” Valerie yelled, reaching down to her neck and finding blood there.  She then felt two more spots on the back of her head where she was cut as well.  She was bleeding from three areas and knew that she wouldn’t make it until dawn if she didn’t get help.<br><br>  She heard a noise from the corner of the basement and turned her head to look over there.  There, sitting on the ground, was a woman.  She had been crying and was just sitting there.  Valerie started to scream for help, but was cut short by a hand across her mouth.<br><br>  “Valerie?” the woman asked.<br><br>  “Mary,” she said.  “Help me!”<br><br>  She looked up to see that Mary’s hands were tied behind her back and that she had been crying as well.  She had a cut on her neck, but was still alive.<br><br>  “I can’t help you,” Mary said.<br><br>  “Why not?” Valerie asked.<br><br>  “I’m tied to the chair,” she said.<br><br>  Valerie looked over to see that she was right.  It had been too dark for her to see it before.  Mary looked over and saw that Valerie had been cut too.<br><br>  “I’m sorry,” Mary said.<br><br>  “I need to get out of here,” Valerie said.<br><br>  “I agree,” Mary said.<br><br>  “Do you have anything sharp that you can use to cut the rope?” Valerie asked.<br><br>  “No, I don’t,” Mary said.<br><br>  “But I do,” a man’s voice said from behind them.<br><br>  Valerie and Mary turned to see John Doe standing behind them.<br><br>  “You,” Valerie said.<br><br>  “Yes, you Valerie,” he said.<br><br>  “It was you who cut my neck,” she said.<br><br>  “It was, but you won’t die until dawn, so I had to take care of your friend here first,” he said.<br><br>  “You monster,” Mary said.<br><br>  “I am, but I won’t kill either of you until sunrise,” he said.  “However, you need to get out of this basement before then.”<br><br>  “How do we do that?” Valerie asked.<br><br>  “You can figure it out,” he said.<br><br>  Mary started to cry again and Valerie could tell that she was scared.<br><br>  “Come here,” John Doe said.<br><br>  Valerie could see that he was holding a knife in his hands.  She knew that it was just a matter of time before he cut Mary’s throat.  He walked over to the chair where Mary was sitting and started to cut the rope on her hands.<br><br>  “What are you doing?” Valerie asked.<br><br>  “I am cutting your friend loose,” he said, “but you only have twenty-four hours to escape.  Are we clear?”<br><br>  “Yes,” Valerie said.<br><br>  Mary was finally free and ran over to the corner of the basement where Valerie was.

Shannon was spending more time alone at home because her father didn’t seem interested in doing anything with her, and so it seemed as though she had no one else to turn to but herself. “She’s trying to cope with her loss, and I don’t think she’s learned to do that yet,” Uncle Jeff said.<br><br>Shannon was sitting on the edge of her bed, holding a box of oil paints that was given to her by her mother before she passed away from cancer. She started crying uncontrollably once again upon seeing both her uncle and father approach her room slowly. “What are you doing here?” Shannon asked, wiping the tears from her face and standing up. There were paint stains on her cheeks, nose and hands. Her uncle could see that she had been crying for a while.<br><br>“I came to talk to you,” her father said.<br><br>“About what?” Shannon asked, turning away from them. She started pacing around the room as she spoke. “You don’t care how I feel, so why should I tell you?” she asked.<br><br>Her father stepped inside the room and placed a hand on her shoulder. “I do care about how you feel daughter,” he said softly. Her uncle noticed that there were small tears forming in her father’s eyes.<br><br>“Yeah, right. If you did care, you wouldn’t have left us all behind to deal with this grief on our own,” she said, turning to face her father directly now. She looked in his eyes and saw that he had started crying now. “He doesn’t care.” She turned to face her uncle now. “You don’t care either, do you?”<br><br>Her uncle sighed and shook his head slowly. He did care, but he knew that she wouldn’t believe him just yet. “No, I do care Shannon,” he said gently.<br><br>She looked at him for a few moments while the tears continued to fall from her father’s eyes and then nodded and walked over to sit on her bed. The two men stood nearby, unsure of what to do next. Her father was crying now,  so he didn’t know how to handle this situation.<br><br>Shannon saw the box of oil paints on her nightstand. She picked it up and opened it slowly, letting the tears continue to stream down her face as she did so. She stared at the empty canvas in front of her for a few moments before she took out a large brush and dipped it into a small jar of red paint. Then, Shannon started to paint.<br><br>She started painting out of her own grief and loneliness, but as she worked, she found that somehow painting helped to ease it. She painted for hours and didn’t eat anything. Shannon’s need to paint became so strong that she decided to clear out her attic and turn it into a studio, so that she could paint there whenever she felt like it.<br><br>She turned her old wooden desk into a workbench and filled the walls with canvases, paints, brushes, and other painting materials. Shannon moved her easel to the center of the room and placed two chairs in front of it. She hung some potted plants in the corners of the room for decoration purposes. The attic was small, but she didn’t mind that. It was just right for her. It also reminded  her of the attic in the family’s old barn.<br><br>Shannon would spend hours in the studio, painting and listening to music on her headphones. She discovered that drawing people helped her to feel connected with her mother once more, and so she would draw portraits of her mother over and over again. The  act of drawing also helped Shannon to cope with her feelings.<br><br>Shannon started to put her own feelings into the paintings, too. She could often be found staring at one of her own unfinished paintings, which had two figures standing in a meadow. The figures were very dark and pale, reflecting Shannon’s feelings of being filled with darkness but also feeling a glimmer of light at the same time.<br><br>This painting became an outlet for Shannon and she would often sit and stare at it for long periods of time to try to work some of her pain and confusion out on it. Sometimes, she would cover the painted surface with salt and trace the outlines of her paintings in a faint blue wash. This felt like she was connecting with someone, especially since her own mother could no longer speak to her. Shannon felt as if she were having a conversation with her mother by painting the images over and over again. Shannon started to feel closer to her paintings and knew that they helped her to heal.<br><br>Shannon painted for hours every day, with only a short break for lunch which she always ate while standing up. She drank a lot of water so that she wouldn’t feel weak or tired. She felt almost as peaceful as when she was painting and felt that it was her therapy. Shannon painted every night until she finished a painting, and then she would start a new one. Sometimes, she would paint for six hours straight without stopping, and this helped to ease the pain in her heart. Sometimes, while painting, Shannon felt like",1
Jennifer comes home from work to find her husband in bed with another woman.,"Jennifer pulled her car into the driveway and sighed. She had been at work since seven in the morning and, after a long day of meetings and sales presentations, she didn’t want to deal with her screaming child and ungrateful husband. When she had gotten home from work, she found her husband in bed with another woman and her child happily playing with a new toy. It was at that moment that she thought to herself that she was better off without them and walked out the door, leaving her house keys on the counter.<br><br>It had been four months since Jennifer left her husband and moved to a small town outside of Boston. She had found a job, found a new apartment, enrolled her daughter in a local preschool and started getting used to life on her own. She still thought about her husband and child – she missed them – but knew that it was a decision that she had to make. It was one of the hardest decisions that she had ever had to make but, in the end, it was what she felt was best for everyone involved.<br><br>Jennifer walked into her apartment and immediately saw that there was a light on in her bedroom. She stopped for a second and turned around to see if it was someone else’s apartment, thinking that she had gotten the wrong door. The lights were the same and no one was there. She shrugged and continued into her apartment, wondering if she was seeing things again. Her daughter, Alyssa, had been born with an eye condition that had cost Jennifer and her husband a lot of money to fix and had resulted in Alyssa wearing glasses.<br><br>Jennifer walked into her bedroom and looked around. It wasn’t spotless, like it had been when she’d first moved in, but it was the most comfortable place that she had ever lived in. She looked at her bed and smiled. She would never get used to having the whole bed to herself again; her daughter had never liked sharing a bed with her and the constant kicking and moving had gotten on Jennifer’s nerves.<br><br>As Jennifer was about to change into some comfortable clothes, she saw a large, blue box sitting on her bed. She walked over to it and picked it up. She knew that he wouldn’t call her; she had changed her number just in case he ever decided to track her down.<br><br>She reached into the box and pulled out a large, flat envelope and a smaller envelope. She opened the larger envelope and pulled out a sheet of paper with her husband’s handwriting on it. Jennifer felt her stomach drop when she realized what it was.<br><br>Dear Jennifer,<br><br>I hope that you open this letter and read it in person – I don’t think that it will have the same meaning if I just told you on the phone that I was sorry. I don’t deserve your forgiveness for what I did – I know that. You have every right to hate me for what I did and to never want to see me again.<br><br>Alyssa has been asking about you every day and I have been telling her that you’re still at the office working hard. But, as much as I try to hide it from her, I know that it’s not doing her any favors. I think that it’s best if she knows the truth – that you are not at the office but, instead, that we live in different places now.<br><br>You were my best friend for so long and I never thought that I would do something to change that. But, when she told me that she was pregnant, I felt like my life was over. Alyssa is a beautiful child and she deserves to have both parents in her life.<br><br>I don’t know what I’m going to do without you but I hope that you will forgive me one day and let me meet my daughter.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Jonathan Jenkins<br><br>Jennifer covered her mouth and held her head in her hands. She was crying so hard that she couldn’t even make out the words on the paper in front of her. She stood up and walked back to the bedroom door. She opened the door and saw Alyssa sitting there, looking at the box. Jennifer walked over to her and kneeled down.<br><br>“Did you see what I found today?” Jennifer asked and smiled at her daughter. Alyssa looked at Jennifer with a confused look on her face. They continued staring at each other until finally Jennifer saw a tear rolling down Alyssa’s face.<br><br>“I miss mommy…” Alyssa said with a croak in her voice. Jennifer reached out and hugged her daughter and cried. She cried for what was lost but also for what was left – her daughter, who was still there, waiting for her.<br><br>Jennifer stood up and sat on the bed with Alyssa in her lap. She opened the smaller envelope and pulled out a black and white photograph. In the photo, Jennifer was standing on a rocky beach; she was wearing a white sundress that covered her knees and sandals. Her hair was pulled up into a ponytail and she was holding her baby daughter in her arms. Alyssa was wearing a red dress with white sandals and had her hair pulled into two pigtails that were held together by pink ribbons. She had a big smile on her face and looked like she was about to burst from happiness.<br><br>“Who’s that?” Alyssa asked after a few minutes had passed. Jennifer knew that she wasn’t going to be able to avoid answering the question forever. Jennifer took a deep breath, patted Alyssa on the back, and looked at the photograph. She studied her face for several minutes before closing her eyes. When she opened them again, there was a faint smile on her face.<br><br>“That’s Mommy and you when you were just a little baby,” Jennifer said with a smile of her own.<br><br>“I don’t remember you, Mommy. I only remember mommy and daddy being",1
Aimee Kincaid goes home after a long day at work only to find her apartment empty and her loneliness amplified by the silence.,"Aimee Kincaid came home to an empty apartment. She found the silence deafening. She felt alone, even though she had spent the day around people, listening to them talk and laugh and complain. She knew how it sounded when a person sat in solitude after a long trip. She would return from a long journey and sit on her bed and watch the light through the blinds or listen to her neighbor’s conversations with his wife on their balcony.<br><br>But she had never been home alone like this. Maybe that was why she felt so strange. So different, out of place. The solitude was new to her.<br><br>She went into the bathroom and turned on the shower and then, without really knowing why she wanted to, she moved through the apartment turning on all the lights. She turned them on in the kitchen, in her bedroom, even in the closet where nothing but old clothes were kept neatly folded. She  lit candles strategically placed around the room so that shadows could not obscure her vision or movement. She sat on her couch and listened to the silence, stared at the flickering lights, waiting for them to hypnotize her into a dreamy state of mind.<br><br>She was very tired but could not sleep. She stood up and found her way to the bedroom where she stripped off her clothes, put on a nightgown, and climbed into bed. She turned off all the lights except for the bedside lamp and lay there listening to the ticking of the wall clock and to the faint drone of cars passing on the street below. Silence was the only sound in the apartment now, and it was completely deafening.<br><br>Aimee felt a sudden sense of panic and fear. She had the feeling that someone was watching her, that someone or something was waiting for her to be completely vulnerable before striking out at her. She found herself looking around her apartment, trying to see something or someone who could be causing this feeling. But she found nothing there, only the light from the lamp moving gently against her walls and ceiling. Silence was all around her, and it seemed so absolute that she felt as if she were being smothered by its weight. Silence was all-encompassing. In her apartment.<br><br>Silence was all-encompassing in her own small corner of the world, and it was suffocating to her. Silence pressed in on her from all sides, making it hard for her to breathe, and she felt suddenly overwhelmed by it.  She started to cry.<br><br>She cried because the silence was terrifying. She cried because it was so loud, so overwhelming. She cried because she felt alone in a way that no one should have to feel alone, her own small safe island surrounded by an ocean of noise and voices that had suddenly turned into nothing more than a silent and lonely roaring emptiness.<br><br>She felt exhausted and drained, drained of all the energy it took to simply get through her day. She felt lonely, unable to see past the walls that surrounded her, unable to even reach out for something solid with which she could hold on. She felt defeated by the  silence around her because she knew that it would never be silent again, at least not for a very long time.<br><br>She cried because there was no one in her apartment, there was no where else to go, there was nothing else to do but cry and wonder why the hell she had ever come back in the first place. She cried because she suddenly felt so alone, more alone than even being at work with all those people who were unable to see past her mask, and all she wanted was to be surrounded by voices and noise.<br><br>She kept crying as she washed her face and brushed her teeth, crying because there was",1
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"Anna sighed with relief as she hung up her work clothes. She had spent the entire day cleaning up the hallways and bathrooms at St. John’s Elementary School, but it was finally done. It was going to be one hell of a week, but at least she had her favorite shows to look forward to. She decided that she would finish some household chores before she would settle down for the night. Anna picked up her long-handled mop and bucket and began to scrub the kitchen floor. As she was moving from one side of the kitchen to the other, wiping up dirt and grime, her cell phone began to ring. It was a number she did not recognize, but Anna decided to answer it anyway. She hoped that speaking with someone might help ease the boredom that had been plaguing her for the past few hours.<br><br>	“Hello?” Anna asked when she picked up.<br><br>	“Hey, honey, it’s me,” said a female voice on the other end of the line.<br><br>	Anna recognized the voice immediately; it belonged to her mother, who was supposed to be at work.<br><br>	“Mom? Shouldn’t you be at work right now?”<br><br>	“No, honey, I took the day off, remember? You and your father had a fight last night. I figured you could use a little bit of company.”<br><br>	“Oh right,” Anna remembered. “I completely forgot about that.”<br><br>	“How are you doing?” asked Anna’s mother.<br><br>	“I’m okay. I guess,” said Anna, her tone indicating that she was not very happy with the conversation. “How are you doing?”<br><br>	“Oh, I’m fine, honey. I just wanted to make sure that you’re doing okay. Oh, and your father called me a few minutes ago. He says he’s sorry for whatever happened last night, and he wants to make sure that you are okay. He also said that he would call you later.”<br><br>	Anna rolled her eyes. “Mmm, that’s nice, Mom. Of course he said that, but I’m not sure how much I believe him.”<br><br>	“Well, maybe you should trust your father. You know how much he cares about you. I know he’s your father, but maybe you shouldn’t take it out on him so much.”<br><br>	“Yeah, I guess you’re right, Mom. I don’t know why I do that to him. It’s just that he seems to always have to have the last word, and then he makes me feel like shit. I can never tell him anything about my feelings. He just gets angry and says that I’m being stupid. It’s just frustrating.”<br><br>	“I understand, honey, trust me, I do, but you’re going to have to learn to work with him. You are both adults now, and there are things that both of you need to deal with. I don’t want you to get married and then have these same problems all over again. Sometimes it’s hard for me to be married, but your father and I love each other very much. We’re still working on a way to make it work, but sometimes I just can’t stand being married to him. We’re both very stubborn, and that doesn’t help matters any.”<br><br>	“I know, Mom. I just don’t know how to deal with him sometimes. I always try to avoid telling him things and then just bottle everything up. I know that’s not healthy, but I don’t know what to do about it.”<br><br>	“I understand, honey, and I know you probably don’t want to hear it, but I have to say it anyway. You really need to learn how to express yourself and deal with your dad. I know he’s stubborn, but so are you, and if you guys aren’t able to talk about your feelings, that isn’t going to help anything. You need to learn how to open up to him. It will be hard, but I know that you can do it. Your father loves you very much, and he just wants what is best for you. Sometimes he doesn’t know how to act. He shouldn’t have said some of the things that he did last night, but it is important that you understand where he’s coming from.”<br><br>	“Mmm, yeah, I know you’re right, Mom. You always are. I guess I’m just not ready to deal with him yet. Maybe one day, but I don’t think that will happen anytime soon.”<br><br>	“Well, that’s okay, but you do need to remember that if you want your relationship with him to improve, you have to work at it. You can’t just keep avoiding it forever. When you get married, I don’t want you guys to be fighting all the time. You know how important your marriage is to me, and I don’t want you to ruin it by not talking about things. You have to learn how to open up, and it’s okay for you to be angry, but you have to learn how to deal with it. Sometimes the best way to deal with it isn’t to keep everything bottled up.”<br><br>	Anna was silent for a moment, as she was thinking about what her mother had just said. She knew that she was running away from her problems, but she didn’t know what to do. She loved her mother very much, and she knew that everything that she said was always for the best. She knew that she should trust her mother, but",1
"The school is full of dark secrets, and the janitor is the only one who knows the truth.","it was hard. She had just had a fight with her dad, and she wasn’t ready to confront him about it yet. She knew that her mother was right, but she was just too stubborn to tell her that.<br><br>	“I know, Mom, but I’m not ready for this conversation right now. I have work to do and I can’t focus on every little thing. I’m sorry, but I just need to work right now. I’m sorry, but you are going to have to deal with my problems for the time being. I love you, Mom.”<br><br>	“I love you, too. I’ll be back to pick you up in a little while. Don’t stay too late at work.”<br><br>	“I won’t, Mom. Have a good day. I love you.”<br><br>	Anna hung up the phone and went back to her desk to get started on the work that she had to do. She was just going through some of her email when she received an email from Tyler that made her smile.<br><br>	“Hey beautiful,” it said. “I miss you already. Can’t wait to see you. I love you.”<br><br>	Anna smiled as she looked at the email for a moment. She thought about how glad she was that they were able to resolve their issues last night. They were going to be getting married, and they were going to be able to spend all of their time together, and that was exactly what she wanted. She knew that Tyler was her soul mate, and that they were meant to be together. She didn’t know why she was so lucky to have Tyler, but she was, and she was going to enjoy every second of it.<br><br>	“I’ll see you in a few hours, baby,” Tyler said as he walked into the kitchen. “I can’t wait to see you. I feel like we haven’t seen each other in forever.”<br><br>	Anna smiled as she reached for a towel and dried her hands.<br><br>	“I can’t wait to see you either, Tyler. I miss you so much.”<br><br>	“I love you so much, Anna. Thank you for coming home with me, and thank you for loving me like you do. I can’t imagine my life without you anymore.”<br><br>	“I love you so much, Tyler. I can’t imagine my life without you either. You are my soul mate, and I don’t know what I would do without you. I want to spend every day with you, and I want to be able to spend every night with you too.”<br><br>	“I know how you can make that a reality. When we are married nothing will be able to stop us from spending time together. I just can’t wait for us to be husband and wife. I love you, Anna, and I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.”<br><br> 	Anna smiled as she walked over to Tyler and leaned in to kiss him. She could feel his hands running up and down her arms.<br><br>	“I love you more, Tyler. So tell me, do you want to get married today?” she said as she pulled back.<br><br>	“I don’t know about today, but I definitely want to marry you sooner rather than later.”<br><br>	“Okay then. Let me get some things together so that we can go surprise Mom and Dad.”<br><br>	Tyler smiled and helped Anna gather up some clothes and her toiletries so that they could go tell Anna’s parents that they were getting married.<br><br>	When Anna and Tyler arrived at Anna’s house she was surprised to see her mom sitting in the car. She and her dad had just finished discussing Tyler last night, and now she was here to meet him.<br><br>“What are you doing here?” Anna asked.<br><br>Anna’s mom laughed. “Your father and I talked all night about you and Tyler. He thinks that you two are the most perfect couple in the world, but he wants to make sure that you are happy, and I couldn’t agree more.”<br><br>“We are happy, Mom. He is my soul mate, and I can’t imagine my life without him.”<br><br>Anna’s mom smiled warmly as she walked over to the car. “Well, now that we have that out of the way, do you want to go tell your dad and I that you are getting married today?”<br><br>Anna laughed. 	“We would love to tell you, but we are hoping that you will be able to make it work.”<br><br>“Are you kidding? I would never miss this.”<br><br>“What about your job?” Tyler asked.<br><br>Anna’s mom smiled. “I am taking a sabbatical for a year, and then I’ll go back to work. Don’t think that I have forgotten that you and Tyler want kids. I wouldn’t miss this for the world.”<br><br>Anna hugged her mother tightly. “You are the best mother in the whole wide world. I love you so much, Mom, and I want you to be at my wedding.”<br><br>Anna and Tyler decided to wait until their wedding to tell Anna’s parents that they were pregnant. It was too good of a surprise for them to be told before the wedding. The last thing that they wanted was for their parents to be disappointed in them.<br><br>	They went inside and met her dad, who was just as excited as her mother to hear that Anna and Tyler were getting married.<br><br>	It was going to be a wonderful day, and Anna couldn’t wait for it to begin.",0

But she didn’t want to be the one to make a mistake, and she wanted to make sure she had everything in order before presenting it to the client.<br><br>	But now, here she was, standing in front of them, rambling on about changes in market share and market growth and customer response, when all she really wanted to do was push the whole mess over onto someone else and run out of the room screaming.<br><br>	She was sure that everyone could sense her mood, and they must have been wondering what was wrong with her. It was as if she couldn’t speak or move, and it was all she could do to keep from running out of the room.<br><br>	“Miss Martin?” one of the younger members of her team finally said. “Maybe you should get some rest? You’ve been up all night.”<br><br>	She looked into his eyes, and for just a moment, she thought he might be right. But she couldn’t do that; it would be disastrous for the company and disastrous for her. No, she had to just suck it up and get through the meeting. Once she was done, she could finish her presentation and get some sleep. She wasn’t exactly sure how she was going to do it, but she knew that if she broke down now, after all this time and effort, it would be the worst thing she could do.<br><br>	“All right,” she said, “let’s continue with the meeting.”<br><br>	And the meeting went on, and she continued to talk about everything she had been preparing for days. Even though she was in the middle of a presentation, she kept checking her watch, counting down the minutes until it was over.<br><br>	She thought it was almost over when there was a knock on the door.<br><br>	“Come in,” she said, not even bothering to look at whoever had entered the room.<br><br>	She heard the door open and close, and she kept talking, even though it sounded as if someone had started to walk across the room. And when she finally looked up and saw who had entered the room, her heart stopped beating for a second.<br><br>	It was her father.<br><br>	He was standing in the doorway, looking at her with a smile - one of those smiles that she remembered from when she was little.<br><br>	“Hi,” he said, and she finally realized that it was not really him, because he was too tall and too thin. This man’s shoulders were broad, his frame was thin, and his hair was gray.<br><br>	“You scared me,” Shannon said, but the man who was standing in front of her continued to smile.<br><br>	“I’m sorry. I almost didn’t come,” he said. He started to walk toward her, and she noticed a woman standing to his side. She didn’t look familiar, and Shannon thought that she must be the person he was with last night.<br><br>	“Shannon?” her father said, and she finally realized that it was him. “It’s me, your dad.”<br><br>	She couldn’t believe it; he was standing in front of her. They hadn’t spoken since her mother had committed suicide, and he had never once come to visit after she had been sent away to live with her aunt. But after everything that had happened, after leaving her aunt’s house and returning to the city, she wanted to see him. She needed to see him. She wasn’t sure if she wanted to hug him or slap him, but she wanted to see him.<br><br>	“Hi, Dad,” she said.<br><br>	She didn’t know what to say or what to do; it was so strange, seeing him standing there in front of her. Finally, he took a step forward and held out his arms.<br><br>	“Shannon, we need to talk about your",0
Jenna Adams meets Brian Johnson and immediately feels drawn to him.,"Jenna Adams was looking around the small, dingy apartment she called home. She rolled her eyes and sighed. She wanted out of this place so badly.<br><br>How did she get stuck in this hell hole, she wondered for the hundredth time. She didn’t have a lot of money, but she was saving as much as possible. With any luck, she’d be able to afford a new place in just a few more months.<br><br>     She was sitting on the couch, reading a romance novel. She hated romance novels, but they seemed like the only reading material she could afford. The people that lived in her building all considered her odd. They had various reasons for that opinion; she didn’t wear much makeup, she dressed simply, and she rarely spoke. She was always reading a book or working on her computer.<br><br>Jenna had been working on her computer for the last two hours. She was trying to get enough money to afford renting an apartment of her own. She needed a good job, but didn’t have much education. She worked at a grocery store, but hardly ever got any hours. The store was open 24 hours a day and seven days a week, but they were only required to provide a certain number of employees. It was hard for Jenna to make enough money with only five shifts a month, so she was looking to get a second job. She was currently working on her resume.<br><br>     Tonight, Jenna had decided to have a quiet night in. She wanted to finish reading her book and work on her resume. Nothing exciting ever happened in Jenna’s life, at least not very often.<br><br>Jenna heard a knock on the door. She jumped up and ran over to it, but by the time she got there, she was too late. The person had already left and closed the door behind them.<br><br>     Jenna looked through the peep hole. It was a man with dark brown hair and blue eyes. He looked very attractive. Jenna was drawn to him immediately, but knew he wasn’t her type. He was too handsome.<br><br>     After about ten minutes, the man knocked again. This time, Jenna opened the door immediately.<br><br>“Can I help you?” she asked.<br><br>“I’m sorry to bother you, but I think I left my phone in your apartment,” he said.<br><br>“I don’t think anyone in this building has a cell phone, so I highly doubt it,” she replied.<br><br>“I’ve been to everyone’s apartment and they all said no, but you were the last place I tried,” he said.<br><br>“I still doubt it, but I can check for you,” Jenna said.<br><br>She walked back into her apartment and looked at the phone on her desk. Just as she suspected, it was missing. She found the number of the person who had called her, and dialed it.<br><br>“Hello,” a woman answered.<br><br>“Do you know who owns this phone?” Jenna asked.<br><br>There was a couple of seconds of silence and then, “Yes, I do.”<br><br>“This is the person I talked to just a few minutes ago. He left it in my apartment by mistake,” Jenna said.<br><br>“Oh, hi, this is the hospital. I was calling you about your test results, but I don’t need to because the doctor wants to see you in his office tomorrow afternoon,” the woman said.<br><br>Jenna was confused. She thought she had an apartment full of uneducated people, but she was pretty sure that woman worked in a hospital.<br><br>“I don’t understand, how did you get my phone number?” Jenna asked.<br><br>“I gave it to him,” the woman replied.<br><br>“Why would you tell him my phone number?” Jenna said.<br><br>“He needed to get ahold of you, but couldn’t find your address, so I gave him your phone number,” she said.<br><br>Jenna was beyond confused. She turned and began to walk back to her apartment door, but the man stopped her by grabbing her arm.<br><br>“Don’t go yet, I need to tell you something,” he said.<br><br>“I don’t have time for this, but please tell me what you have to say and then I will leave,” Jenna said.<br><br>The man smiled at her and sat down on the couch. “My name is Brian Johnson and I am a doctor. I wanted to tell you that you have cancer and that you will be dead in a couple of months. I would recommend that you give up school and get your affairs in order.”<br><br>Jenna was shocked and furious. She turned and started to leave the room.<br><br>“Wait,” Brian said.<br><br>She turned back around and waited for him to speak.<br><br>“It’s okay, I am just pulling your leg. I just wanted to see how you would react,” he said.<br><br>Jenna breathed a sigh of relief. She hadn’t realized it at the time, but she had been holding her breath. She couldn’t believe how scared she had been. She sat down next to him on the couch and they began to talk.<br><br>“So, what’s your story?” Brian asked.<br><br>Jenna was a little stunned by the sudden change of topic, but she thought that maybe he was just trying to get to know her better. “My story?” she said.<br><br>“Yes, I mean you have to be at least twenty-one years old, so there has to be a story there,” Brian answered.",0
"Shannon lands her first major assignment, a feature on the inner city, but quickly discovers that the ugly reality of life in the city is far different from the dream she imagined.",". Shannon decided that this woman might be a good person to interview.<br><br>When Shannon introduced herself and asked the woman if she would be willing to talk to her, the woman responded rudely, saying she did not have time for interviews because she had to have her bottle of beer filled before noon so that she could get some sleep.<br><br>Shannon was amazed at the woman’s casual response to questions about crime, and decided she had to ask more questions. She told the woman that she was a reporter from the local paper trying to find out what people were talking about in the inner city. She asked if there was anything in particular on the news that the woman would like to talk about. The woman responded by saying, “Nothing is going on here but a bunch of fools and liars. Nothing else is going on here other than crime, ignorance, and stupidity.”<br><br>Shannon then asked what news reports the woman wanted to discuss. The woman said there were none because there were no news reports in the newspaper, because reporters did not care about people in the inner city.<br><br>At this point Shannon moved on to another subject, asking if there were any stories that she should cover. The woman responded, “In the news? Are you joking with me? News about how black people are being screwed over? How we have to drink piss water from a fountain? How we have to use our hands as toilets when there is no public restroom in sight? How we don’t have a say-so in our local and national government? News on the news? Do you think some white reporter will tell black people what’s happening in their own lives? Do you think if you tell us what the white man is trying to do to us that we are going to be glad that you told us ? News on the news?”<br><br>The woman continued, “You’re right. We don’t have anything to talk about because there is nothing happening here. Things are at a standstill, and nobody cares. Nobody in the inner city seems to care about anything, so how can you expect a reporter to write about us? So, no, I don’t have anything for you.”<br><br>Harsh words from the young woman. Shannon listened attentively and then thanked her for her time. She was not deterred by the woman’s hostile tone. Shannon moved on  to the next interview.<br><br>“I want to talk about the high crime rate in your neighborhood,” Shannon said in a soft voice to the middle-aged man with a stubbly beard and unkempt hair.<br><br>“What high crime rate?” he responded, surprised and defiant.<br><br>Shannon looked around. It was obvious that the surrounding residents did not find the question shocking at all. She knew that whatever she found here would be different from what she had imagined, but this was far beyond anything she could have expected.<br><br>“Are there gang fights in this neighborhood?” Shannon continued.<br><br>“Only when the other neighborhoods come over here, but that doesn’t happen very often. That only happens once in a while. That ain’t high crime rates, that’s just plain old lowdown fighting. It ain’t high crime when the city lets the other neighborhoods run all over this neighborhood and do what they want to do here. That ain’t no high crime rate. That is just plain old ugly and nasty. Nobody cares about that here, because nobody cares about us no how, not even our own folks. They say everybody is equal",1
Julia Martin starts to experience terrifying visions.,"Julia had always been certain about the things that were important in life. For her, the most important things were those related to her family and friendships. Everything else seemed trivial and inconsequential.<br><br>The sun beat down on the small town, and people drove their cars along the two-lane road, stopping for groceries at the local grocery store or for a quick bite at the café. Julia Martin sat on a bench on the main street of town, waiting for her mother to finish her shift at the bank. She watched as cars drove past, wondering what it was like to live in one. She had never been very fond of the car she had grown up with, but she envied the families that could travel in one, see the country together, and have a carefree life. She envied the families that could afford to buy their groceries at the high-end grocery store. She envied the people who had never struggled.<br><br>The last thing on her mind was death.<br><br>Death was not something that she had ever paid much attention to. She had never worried about dying herself, and although she had seen many people die during her time at the hospital, those deaths were a result of illness or accident. They were not violent and senseless.<br><br>And then it happened.<br><br>The first time she saw him, she was sitting on the bench waiting for her mother to finish her shift at the bank. She had her eyes closed and was enjoying the sun on her face. The sound of a car driving past brought her out of her reverie, and she opened her eyes.<br><br>She was staring directly at the passing car. Or rather, she was staring into the driver’s eyes. The man in the car was staring at her with an intensity that made her feel uncomfortable. She didn’t know who he was, and she didn’t know why he was staring at her. She felt like someone was watching her and that something bad was about to happen.<br><br>She heard a woman screaming in the distance. Julia wanted to run, but she couldn’t move. It felt like if she moved, she would be doing something wrong. Her mother came out of the bank and saw Julia on the bench.<br><br>“Hi, Mommy!” Julia said.<br><br>“Hi, honey! Do you want to go get some ice cream?”<br><br>Julia didn’t answer. She simply stared at her mother with panicked eyes.<br><br>“Julia? Honey? What’s wrong?”<br><br>“Um, never mind, Mommy. I don’t really feel like ice cream. Let’s go home.”<br><br>Julia’s mother looked at her daughter with concern in her eyes, and Julia realized that she had left her mother standing there in the hot sun with nothing to do for nearly an hour already. She felt guilty, but she was still terrified of the things she had seen in her vision.<br><br>As they walked back home, Julia tried to explain what she had seen. She told her mother about the man in the car and about how he had stared at her with an intensity that made her uncomfortable. She told her mother about the woman screaming and about how she hadn’t been able to move.<br><br>As she talked, Julia realized that she had never felt this way before. She had never felt so sure of something without having very good reason for being so sure. She had never been so sure of something that was so strange and unnatural.<br><br>That night, Julia was terrified to go to bed. She wanted to stay up until her mother came home from work so that she would have someone to protect her. She didn’t want to be alone.<br><br>When her mother came home, she asked Julia why she had been so upset that morning. Julia told her about her vision and the strange man in the car. Her mother listened carefully and promised that she would take care of things. She said that Julia would never have to be alone again.<br><br>The next day, Julia’s mother took her shopping to buy a bike. She said that Julia could ride her bike anywhere she wanted as long as she stayed out of the forest. She said that the forest was a dangerous place, and no one should ever go there.<br><br>After Julia had ridden her bike for a while, she started to feel a little better. She was able to put her vision and the man in the car out of her mind and focus on having fun. The next day, she started to feel even better, and by the end of the week, she was feeling almost like her old self.<br><br>That night, Julia slept in her own room for the first time since she had seen that vision of the man. She felt safe and secure. She fell asleep quickly and slept soundly until morning. When her mother came into her room, she was surprised to see Julia sitting up in bed, waiting for her.<br><br>“Julia, I thought you were sleeping.”<br><br>“I am, Mommy. I just woke up a little while ago. Do you want to play a game?”<br><br>Julia’s mother was pleasantly surprised that her daughter had forgotten about the man in the car so quickly. She said that she would love to play a game and that they could play any game she wanted as long as it wasn’t in the forest. She said that if they went into the forest, something bad would happen.<br><br>As Julia and her mother played games, Julia began to feel even better. She was able to put the man in the car behind her, but she couldn’t help but wonder why he had been staring at her. She wondered why she had felt so sure that something bad was about to happen. She tried to forget about the man and everything else, but she couldn’t help wondering what would happen if she saw him again.<br><br>That night, Julia and her mother went to bed and fell asleep quickly.

"With supplies running low and tensions high, the group must work together to find a way out before it's too late.","was at the table. Jennifer leaned against the wall next to the door and waited. It had been several hours and it was finally dark outside, which meant it would be safer for her to go out. She checked her compass one more time before heading out into the forest.<br><br>Jennifer moved quickly through the woods towards the stream. The trees were thick here, and it was easy to get lost in them. Without any landmarks, she couldn’t tell whether or not she was going the right way.<br><br>She reached down and pulled her shirt up over her nose to block out the smell of mildew that still lingered in the air. Jennifer moved as quickly as she could, but it was slow going in the dark.<br><br>The last thing she needed was to run into another group of survivors and have to fight them for what little they had now. It would be better if she found the stream on her own and moved in that direction. It wasn’t likely that there would be another house nearby, but it was possible.<br><br>Jennifer moved silently through the trees, moving slowly and carefully so as not to make any sound. She was walking through a small clearing when she heard something move behind her. She moved faster, but it was too late.<br><br>The group moved to the house. Jennifer had already been there and knew how to get in, so she let the others go first. They moved quietly through the woods until they reached a small clearing where they could see the stream and an old house. The house was about three hundred yards away, but it was dark out and there were trees everywhere, so it was hard to tell exactly how far away it was.<br><br>Moving closer to the house, she moved quickly around the side of the house so that she could check for signs of life. She came around the house to find a small building in the back left corner. Walking towards it, Jennifer moved slowly so as not to attract any attention from anyone who might be inside. She moved up and peeked into the window, only to see a dim light.<br><br>Moving slowly up to the door, Jennifer carefully tried opening it, moving slowly at first then using more force after a moment. The door creaked open just enough for her to slip through the crack. Moving slowly into the house, she saw that it was made of some kind of metal and glass. There was a large table in the middle of the room with chairs surrounding it.  She could not tell if anyone was inside, but there were some supplies on the table that she wanted to look at.<br><br>She moved over to the table and put her backpack on the ground, then opened it so she could take out her flashlight. She moved the light around until she found a bottle of bleach,  three packs of beef jerky with 12 pieces in each pack, and a small bag of Doritos. The food would not last for the entire group for very long, but it would give them something to eat for the next couple of days.<br><br>Moving back to the door, she tried pushing on it but it would not budge. She tapped the door several times, hoping someone was inside who could help her get out. After several more minutes of no response, she decided that they must have gone out through another door in the house. Putting her backpack on again, she headed to the other side of the house to find  another exit.<br><br>She walked down the hallway and turned a corner, but saw that it was blocked by debris that had fallen from a hole in the ceiling. She moved around the pile of bricks and wood until she found a door with a handle. The door opened, but instead of another hallway she was looking at several piles of rubble that had collapsed onto themselves.<br><br>Stephanie climbed over them and continued her way down the hall when she heard someone coming down the stairs behind her. She turned and prepared to run, but instead of another hostile group she saw a man carrying two cases of bottled water. He was tall, skinny, and muscular with black hair, brown eyes, and multiple tattoos on his arms.<br><br>The group had gathered all the supplies they could carry from the house and were preparing to leave when a man ran into the house.

"Kitty Pawsky, the world's greatest detective, agrees to take on a case in which a string of murders have been committed in a dog park.","The dog park was bustling with activity as the sun rose over the horizon and began to cast it’s light upon the landscape. The only thing that seemed out of place was a gray cat sitting atop a picnic table in the center of the park with his nose buried in a book. At first glance, it looked like he was just another lazy dog owner, but as he raised his head from his book, his features were far too human to be mistaken for anything canine.<br><br>	“Hello?” the cat asked loud enough for his voice to carry throughout the park. “Is anyone there? I would love to get to the bottom of this mystery,” he added, waving a paw at the empty air in front of him.<br><br>	While the cat was speaking, a large mastiff-type dog approached him from behind. The dog was rather gregarious and had a black bandana tied around his neck like a cape. In his right paw, he held a bone like King Arthur would have carried Excalibur.<br><br>	“The name’s Bo,” he said with a smile. “You must be the detective Kitty Pawsky that’s been hired to solve the string of murders in the park.” The dog extended a paw and shook hands with the cat. “I’m one of the local pooches, and I was talking to some of the other doggies about it last night,” he continued. “They say that the Mayor is willing to pay you a pretty penny for your services.” Bo pulled out his wallet and plopped it on the table to show that he was indeed telling the truth.<br><br>	“That settles it,” said Kitty Pawsky as he opened his book and began reading. “I need to pay a visit to the Mayor’s office right away. I’m sure he has some answers for me.”<br><br>	“Come on,” said Bo, grabbing the cat by the scruff of the neck and dragging him along. “I’ll walk you over there.”<br><br>	Before long, they arrived at a two-story building that was painted royal blue and had gold trim all around the windows and doors. The cat stopped and stared in front of him. “This can’t be right,” he said. “There’s no way the Mayor would live in such a modest house. This is definitely the wrong place.”<br><br>	“Mayor’s houses are expensive,” Bo explained. “He’d be wasting his money if he spent it on something like this. Go knock on the door and see what happens.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky reluctantly knocked on the door, which creaked open to reveal a small orange kitten with a yellow collar. He was rubbing his eyes and yawning as he opened the door.<br><br>	“Hi, I’m Mayor Noodles,” said the kitten while scratching his chin. “I didn’t know that you were going to be stopping by, so I wasn’t expecting you. What brings you here?”<br><br>	“I have been hired to solve a string of murders that have taken place in the dog park,” said Kitty Pawsky.<br><br>	“Really?” replied the Mayor, leaning back to look Kitty Pawsky in the eyes. “You don’t look like the type to want to spend your time talking to some hounds and pups.”<br><br>	“I’m a man of many talents, and I take every case seriously,” the cat replied. “Just let me in so we can get started.”<br><br>	“Why didn’t you bring the other members of your team with you?” asked the Mayor.<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky was suddenly struck with a bad feeling about this case. He turned to Bo and mumbled, “I didn’t know that the Mayor would be such a catnip-sniffing puppy.”<br><br>	“I told you this way would be easier,” said Bo. “Now, let’s get this over with.”<br><br>	Mayor Noodles opened the door wider and gestured for Kitty Pawsky to come in. “C’mon in,” he said while scratching his backside.<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky entered the room and saw that the Mayor had decorated it all in yellow. There were chairs with yellow cushions and a yellow table that was surrounded by a yellow carpet. The walls had been painted a pastel shade of yellow and the Mayor had even covered the ceiling with a yellow cloth.<br><br>	“Nice place you’ve got here,” said Bo, scratching at the carpet. “You could use a few more plants and some throw pillows, but other than that, I like it.”<br><br>	“Thanks,” said the kitten, scratching himself behind the ears. “I think it’s pretty cool myself.”<br><br>	The two dogs sat down in a pair of yellow chairs, and the cat went to a yellow table and poured two glasses of milk for them.<br><br>	“How is the town doing?” asked Bo.<br><br>	“The town is fine,” replied Mayor Noodles. “The local economy is booming. It seems as though every cat and dog in the city wants to open a business here.”<br><br>	“That sounds like a good problem to have,” said Kitty Pawsky.<br><br>	“I suppose so,” said the Mayor. “But it’s been a real challenge for me to keep up with everything going on around here. I’m too busy with the town to spend much time with my wife and kids.”",1
Shannon's paintings help her to deal with her grief and to find a new sense of purpose.,"<br><br>Shannon finished wiping away her tears and looked at the canvases on the floor. “I think I really will appreciate them more now, but I don’t know what to do next. Should I put them away or hang them on the wall first?”<br><br>Rosemary thought for a minute. “You can put them in your studio later on. Besides the attic room was getting crowded and now you have a whole other place to work! You can put them up there when you get ready to move each canvas. Right now, I think we should try and get the attic finished first.”<br><br>Shannon looked at the unfinished attic with some sadness. “I know you are right about the attic being too small and I am excited about my new studio, but I will miss working in my old attic. It is where I used to paint all the time with my mom. The attic always held so many memories for me and now that she is gone, I can’t bring myself to clean it out. I have left everything just the way it was.” Shannon moved around in the attic and picked up a few of her mother’s paintings. She put them back down before moving on.<br><br>Shannon’s heart was filled with sadness as she moved down the attic stairs. She had finished cleaning out the room and had started moving the furniture to the studio earlier that day. She had moved her easel and paints, but still hadn’t decided on what  to do about all of her mother’s paintings. The attic was the last room in the house that needed to be cleaned out and Shannon knew she would have to go up there soon no matter how hard it was.<br><br>Shannon put her head in her hands, overwhelmed with sadness and grief. She sat down on the bottom step of the stairs and started crying. “I just wish I had more time with you mom! You were so amazing and I miss you so much!” Shannon covered her face with her hands hoping she wouldn’t cry as hard if she couldn’t see her tears.<br><br>A few minutes later, Shannon heard a soft knock on the door. She quickly wiped her tears and stood up slowly. She opened the door to see her dad standing outside with several large boxes of pizza in his hands.<br><br>“Hey Shan, how are you doing?” He stepped into the room and set the pizza boxes down.<br><br>Shannon wrapped her arms around him and started crying again. “I miss her so much! I can’t believe she is gone!”<br><br>“I know it is hard honey. It gets easier every day, but it also makes a little harder because you miss her so much.” He patted Shannon on the back and looked over her shoulder to see that the floor was already cleared out and she was in the middle of painting.<br><br>“Hey sis!” came a cheerful voice from behind Shannon and she was greeted by the smiling face of her older sister Sara. She walked into the room and brought with her a comforting scent of lavender. “How are you holding up?”<br><br>“I am okay, just missing her so much! I still can’t believe she is gone!” Shannon  cried.<br><br>“It’s okay, we miss her too. But it is going to get better every day, and you will gradually learn to cope with it. You just need something to focus on, something positive that will make you happy. I think painting would be a great way to keep your mind busy, and do something productive to keep your mind off of her. I love seeing what you do Shannon! It brings back so many good memories from when we were kids,” Sara smiled. “You really have a talent there honey, don’t ever forget that!” Shannon felt a ray of hope from her sister’s words and it lifted her spirits. She was determined to prove that she was just as good an artist as her mother had been.<br><br>Shannon felt motivated by the praise. She felt a sense of determination to get better, and try to create more sophisticated paintings. Shannon looked at the brushes that she had gotten from her father’s art supplies, and noticed how much better they were than hers. They were expensive art brushes that had the best quality paint on them. They were much finer than the ones she had been using for her projects, and allowed for more intricate  details.<br><br>Shannon set up a small table in her space in the attic, and started to prepare her palette for a new painting. She felt comfortable and at peace with herself out there, away from the world. The paint that came with the brushes was very high quality, and she was thrilled about experimenting with it. Shannon wanted to try and emulate the style of her mom’s paintings, even if she didn’t quite have the talent and skill yet. She wanted to do it just for her mom, because she knew that her mom would be so proud of her. Shannon hoped that by doing this, she could somehow feel closer to her mother again.<br><br>Shannon wanted to create more beautiful, bigger paintings like the one that hung in her bedroom. They had all of her favorite things about the city; pictures of cars and skyscrapers, as well as various people in different clothes walking around. It was as if Shannon’s mom had known that she would love the city, even though she had never been there herself.",1
Jennifer decides to leave her family and start a new life.,"Well, your daddy and I are getting divorced. You won’t live with us anymore - not right now. Mama will look after you for awhile.”<br><br>Lily twisted around on Jennifer’s lap to look up into her eyes. Her dark brown eyes were full of concern and confusion. “But, but where will we live?”<br><br>“You and me, baby girl - just you and me. We have our own house now.” Jennifer laughed awkwardly, wiping away tears that had begun to form in her eyes again. “Mama has a new job, too.”<br><br>Lily was confused. She didn’t understand what Jennifer was saying. “Where are we going to live? We don’t have a house – not yet. Are we going to live in an apartment?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled, then took a deep breath before she filled them in. “No honey,” she began. “We bought our own house. You know how much I told you I wanted a backyard for the two of us? Well, I got it! We now live in a cul-de-sac, right by the park. It’s a real pretty neighborhood with lots of trees. We even have a swing in our front yard to play on.”<br><br>Lily was starting to understand what Jennifer was talking about, but something still didn’t add up. “Mama, I don’t understand. You said we were going to live at Grandma Jackie’s house.”<br><br>Lily sat up straight and looked at her mama with tear-filled eyes. “Can’t we go to Grandma Jackie? I like it there. What about the park? Can we still go to the park?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled, trying to hide her own tears. “Of course we can! We just don’t live in the same house anymore. We are still a family, just a different kind of family. I still love you as much as ever.”<br><br>Lily nodded and wiped her eyes. “I know, mama,” she started. “It’s just that I didn’t think daddy would do something like that. It was all so sudden, too. Now he won ’t even talk to me.”<br><br>Jennifer put her arm around Lily and pulled her close. “He probably doesn’t know what to say. You should try talking to him some more. I bet he wants you as much as ever. It takes time to get used to the changes.”<br><br>Lily pulled away and looked at Jennifer with a questioning face. “What changes?” she asked, her tone turning sarcastic. “You mean when daddy sells the old house and mama moves out?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled. “Maybe we can still come over and visit,” she said, moving toward the door.<br><br>Jennifer opened the door and moved into the hallway. She turned back to look at her daughter and smiled warmly. “Yes! You can move in with me for a while,” she said, trying to sound optimistic.  “I have a new job and you can go to the same school, and we’ll see how it goes. You might like living with me just as much.”<br><br>Lily shrugged. She had never liked change, but didn’t really have an opinion on this one way or another. “I guess so,” she said doubtfully. But her expression clearly showed her reluctance if Jennifer had looked closely enough.<br><br>Jennifer stepped out the door and walked down the stairs to the sidewalk below. The moving van was parked in front of her house, ready to take her furniture away. She turned back toward the side of the house and waved at her daughter, who was standing there with a group of children.<br><br>“Good-bye!” Jennifer called. Then she turned and moved to the front door across the street, where a middle-aged man stood waiting on the porch.<br><br>“Are you moving in?” the man asked.<br><br>“Yes, I am,” Jennifer answered. “You are moving out?”<br><br>“Yes, I am, too. You don’t look familiar. Are you moving to this neighborhood?”<br><br>“No, I moved from one street over, but I just started a new job and decided to move closer. Moving is such a hassle!”<br><br>The moving man laughed lightly. “I know what you mean. But at least it will be easier moving the rest of your stuff. Moving the big pieces is the worst part.”<br><br>“That’s true, but I want to move all my furniture to the new house today instead of dragging it here tomorrow and back again on Wednesday,” Jennifer said. “This way, I can unpack right away. Do you move furniture often?”<br><br>“Every couple of months. I moved a lot when I was younger, but now I prefer to stay in one place for years at a time. It saves me money, and it gives me more stability with my job. My wife prefers the same thing because moving is hard on the relationship. But it depends on our jobs. We move more when we get transferred to another city or state. Moving is such a hassle, but the longer you stay in one place the harder it is to move on short notice. It can be hard finding a new place if you have to move  quickly.”<br><br>The moving man stopped and picked up a picture frame. He was looking at Jennifer’s pictures of Samantha and Theresa as children, then he replaced the frame on the wall.<br><br>“Yeah, we have two kids, so we may move again in the next few years,” Jennifer said. “But we probably won’t move for a while after this, unless my husband gets transferred again. He’s not getting any younger, so who knows? It’s just nice to not have to move right now. I need some stability after everything that has happened.”<br><br>The moving man smiled and nodded his head in agreement.<br><br>“Moving is a hassle, but at least you can choose where to put everything in the new place. I don’t move very often, but when I do, it is fun to rearrange my stuff and make the place feel more like home. Moving is definitely stressful though. It’s hard to make friends if you move too often because it takes people longer to get to know you.”<br><br>The moving man grunted in response.<br><br>“Some people move all the time, and have a different group of friends at each place they move to. That way, they don’t really have to make any new friends. They already have a group of friends waiting for them wherever they go. That way, they don’t have to go through what you just did. They can move quickly from one place to the next. Moving is easier that way, especially if you have a big family. You can’t move so quickly when you are only moving some of your things, or when you are just moving yourself. Moving can be really easy if you plan ahead. It can also be hard though if you don’t plan ahead, or things don’t go according to your plan. Moving can be a hassle and stressful at times, but it can also be a lot of fun. You just have to know how to dealwith moving stress and keep things from getting too overwhelming.”<br><br>Another moving man came out of the house. He carried a small wooden table and two dining chairs to a nearby truck.<br><br>The moving man, Jennifer, and the other moving men stood at the side of the house as they continued to load and unload boxes from the truck. They moved quickly but carefully , keeping the tables and couches from hitting the walls or scratching the floors. They managed to fit all of Jennifer’s furniture into her small SUV, which had been loaded to the roof with boxes only moments before.<br><br>“Don’t worry, my friend. Everyone has their own methods for moving. If you think it is the right way to do things, then you keep doing it that way. If you want to make sure that everything gets put into place exactly how you want it, then that is what you do. It’s all about figuring out how your mind works and what works best for you. As long as it keeps working and you don’t keep moving, then you have a good way of doing things!”<br><br>The moving men smiled and nodded at Jennifer. They moved to the back of the truck and finished loading all of the furniture. The moving men packed everything into the truck with incredible skill and expert timing.<br><br>Jennifer moved to the passenger’s side of the SUV and picked up her bags. She walked back to side the house and noticed that three of the moving men were busy carrying box after box into the house, while a fourth was watching them from side a doorway. The moving man turned to watch Jennifer get into the side of the SUV.<br><br>“Hey! Why don’t you move in with us? We have some extra space right now and it would be nice to have another girl around. You can move in with us for as long as you need to, and we can move you into a different room when someone else needs to move in. We’re moving into a huge apartment later on and we don’t know anyone else yet. We’ll make sure that you are taken care of, okay?”<br><br>Moving men moved to back of the truck, and got into their side. They drove off towards the other end of the block, moving their way through traffic. Moving men had already done their previous moves and were heading to side their next move. Moving men were moving a lot today and had many moves lined up.<br><br>Jennifer moved back to side the door and thought for a moment.<br><br>This is Side Bar. This is where Jennifer will make her decision regarding moving in with the three moving men.<br><br>“I don’t know,” she said. “It sounds like a lot of responsibility. I don’t want to be a burden.”<br><br>“Don’t worry about it, we can handle it. Just say yes and come with us!”<br><br>Jennifer thought for a moment longer and then made her decision.<br><br>“Yes, I’ll move in with you.",1

They never once considered that the red sun could be their enemy or that the Sun Goddess was dead. After all, she would never leave them, not for a second.<br><br>The Sons of the Sun<br><br>Chapter 1 - A New World<br><br>The sun shone brightly in the sky. There was no sign of the red sun. It had been a few weeks since it created havoc in their lives and people were getting used to it. There was a certain excitement in the air, but no one knew why. It was just another day to them, so most people just went on with their daily lives.<br><br>	Kain stood on a small hill and watched as the rest of his village went about its business. He was twenty seven years old and had been born and raised in his village. He had been a follower of the Sun God just like everyone else, but lately he had begun to question everything and everything he’d once believed in.<br><br>	The other followers didn’t know of his change of heart. They all thought of him as one of them, but if they ever found out what he’d become they would all shun him. They had grown too close to the old ways to allow him to stay. They respected the sun as one of their greatest sources of power and most people gave up their lives for it. They would not stand for one of their own to turn away from it.<br><br>	Kain turned to look down at his village. It was a small village and most people had known each other their entire lives. Most people had never even left the village, let alone their own homes. The people were safe in the village and they would not want to leave, but Kain was different. He was curious about the world. He wanted to see what was out there. He had thought of leaving the village many times before, but there was always something that kept him from leaving, even though he never knew what it was.<br><br>	This time however, he didn’t feel the pull to stay. It was probably because he had seen a man and woman leave the village a few weeks ago. They were going to a new land on the other side of the mountains where it was said that a new land had appeared. Kain wanted to be a part of this new world and he decided that he would ask them how to get there.<br><br>	The sun continued to shine, though the people had finished their day’s work and were preparing to go home. Kain began the long journey back to his house. He knew that his family would be waiting for him there. His house was a small one room hut made of wood and straw. He had no belongings, though he didn’t need any. He’d never owned anything in his life. He couldn’t even remember a time that he’d had to work for anything and he had no idea what it felt like to be tired. He knew that he should feel good about not having to work, but he didn’t. It was very frustrating to him. However, this feeling didn’t last long, for as soon as the sun began to set, he would feel fresh and rejuvenated.<br><br>	Kain began the walk back to his house, having just come from praying to the sun as he did every day. He prayed for strength and the well-being of his family and friends. Kain put his hands high above his head in supplication and closed his eyes tight.<br><br>	He felt a warmth come over him as always, but this time there was more than just a feeling of warmth. He felt something different, something that he didn’t know how to describe.<br><br>	In the middle of his prayer, he saw a bright flash of",0

Kyle comforts Aimee and the two share a heart-to-heart conversation that leaves Aimee feeling understood for the first time.,"<br><br>Kyle looked at her with pity in his eyes, not judging her for acting childishly. “You know, Aimee, I think everyone feels that way at times. You aren’t the only one who gets nervous when you’re alone in a room full of strangers or if your family is acting a little distant. It’s okay to feel lonely sometimes, and it makes perfect sense that you do since you are alone so much. But it doesn’t mean you don’t have friends, that you don’t have people who care about you. It just means that  you’re a little nervous by yourself, that’s all. Being alone can be scary for anyone! That’s normal.”<br><br>Aimee nodded in agreement, not saying anything right away and sort of smiling at the fact that Kyle hadn’t made fun of her or told her she was acting like a wimp. She wasn’t sure if she believed him or not, but it was nice to hear that someone else understood what she felt and didn’t act like she needed to suck it up or something.<br><br>“I know how much I want to be with other people when I feel lonely too, Aimee. It’s a natural human emotion! I know that whenever I’m having a tough time with something, I just want to crawl into bed and not come out until the next morning when everyone is gone. But those feelings will pass. And then I’ll feel better and glad that I didn’t do what I initially wanted to do, which was just wallow in my own self-pity.”<br><br>Aimee furrowed her brows at Kyle. “I never want to be around other people when I’m lonely,” she said. “I just want to be alone. But it doesn’t always help even if I do that, especially if it’s late at night and there’s no one else around to talk to or anything. When I’m lonely, there’s nothing that anyone else can do. The only thing that would make me feel better is to be with a guy who actually understands what I’m going through and wants to be around me. But you don’t see a lot of guys like that, do you?” She shook her head.<br><br>“It’s not easy to find guys who are as understanding as you are, either,” she said. “I wish there were more girls out there like you and Jessica. Guys like David are so rare in this world. I mean, who would think that someone like him would be friends with me?” She smiled sadly at her own words.<br><br>Kyle gazed at Aimee for a few seconds, then shrugged and said with a casual smile, “You’ve got to have something to balance out my craziness. Even though I can be a little  too intense sometimes, I’m sensitive to other people’s needs. And if being understanding is wrong, I don’t want to be right.”<br><br>Aimee smiled at him then nodded, as if giving him an answer. She felt completely relaxed and comfortable around Kyle. That hadn’t happened to her in a while, not to this extent.<br><br>He yawned and Aimee couldn’t help but smile. She yawned too as they got up and headed towards her room. Kyle said goodnight to her parents, who were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV, and Aimee said goodbye to him shortly after. She waved goodbye to him from the door and then turned around and looked at her bedroom.<br><br>Kyle had made her bedroom seem a lot cozier with his presence, she thought to herself. He had also made her feel less alone, a feeling that Aimee wasn’t used to.<br><br>She shut the door behind her and said goodbye one last time to Kyle through the window. She then closed all the blinds and locked her door, went over to her bed, lay down on it and turned off the light. She couldn’t remember the last time she had said goodbye to anybody and felt so…<br><br>Aimee sighed. She didn’t know how to describe the feeling.<br><br>It was a feeling of sadness, yet also a feeling of comfort, a feeling or warmth and hope for the future, she thought to herself. She thought Kyle had said goodbye to her before, but it didn’t seem as real as this did, like Aimee had just said goodbye to someone who she knew could be trusted with her secrets and who would still be there for her when she needed him. <br><br>It was a feeling that Aimee had only felt once before, she thought to herself.<br><br>Aimee got up off of her bed and went over to her bookcase, opened one of the drawers at the bottom of it and started putting away her books.<br><br>She was feeling less and less like sleeping, but she knew that she had a long day ahead of her tomorrow at work, so she turned off the light, closed her eyes and tried to sleep.<br><br>But sleep wouldn’t come. It never did anymore these days, but Aimee rarely ever complained about it, because she knew that there were people who had it worse than her.",1
"Mary Smith, George Smith, Jessica Doe, and John Doe all give testimony in court and John Doe is ultimately convicted and sent to prison.","Wilkinson. Jessica Doe repeated what her husband had said to her about the mugging that night. The only differences between their accounts was that Jessica said George Smith used a gun while John Doe said he used a knife; and that George Smith punched John in the face while John said he just hit him with his fist. Karen Wilkinson thanked her for her time and left her house.<br><br>Karen Wilkinson next went to the police station to get Louise Spencer’s notes on George Smith’s previous interview. She found that Louise had done extensive research on George Smith and had discovered many of his financial troubles. She also found out that he had moved a lot in his life, having moved at least five times in the past ten years.<br><br>Louise Spencer was waiting for her in the interrogation room. She was a tall, dark-haired woman who was very attractive. She had a stern look but she was very polite and professional when they moved into the room. The only furnishings in the room were two plastic chairs placed in front of a small table.<br><br>“Thank you for coming by, Miss Wilkinson. I had hoped to question you earlier, but the interrogation ran longer than expected.”<br><br>“No problem,” said Karen. It was obvious that Louise Spencer was trying hard to make her comfortable during this interrogation.<br><br>“Let us begin then, shall we?” said Louise. “Where were you coming from the night of the mugging?”<br><br>“I was coming from my job at the grocery store. They close the doors at 9 o’clock and I usually try to leave a little early so that I can get there before they lock up the doors. On this particular night, it was hard to leave on time because Mr. Smith and I were having an argument when we got home about his moving to another state. We have been trying to move to another state for the last couple of years but always end up staying here for some reason or another.”<br><br>“Moving to another state seems like a big step. Why do you want to move?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I have a good job here and I don’t want to move away, but my husband wants to move and so we have discussed it over and over again. But he wouldn’t listen to what I had to say this time either, so I  left the house without telling him and decided to walk home because I needed some air.”<br><br>“What did Mr. Smith say when you told him that you were leaving?” asked Louise.<br><br>“He started shouting that I was being disrespectful and then he called me a damn fool!”<br><br>“And what did you do when he said that?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I shouted back at him, but before I knew it he had his gun pointed at me and was demanding my money.”<br><br>Louise looked at George for a long time before she continued.<br><br>“I have a lot of questions about this, Mr. Smith, but before we carry on I need to know whether or not you think Mr. Doe will be convicted for this crime?”<br><br>“I don’t think so, no! He has done this sort of thing before and they let him go,” said George.<br><br>“Why do you think that he will be convicted this time?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I mean, it isn’t like I would really know anything about these things, is it? Do you think he’ll be convicted?” said George.<br><br>Louise was silent for a few seconds.<br><br>“From what I can gather, Mr. Doe has been in trouble before and is often brought in for questioning, but he has never been convicted of anything before now. From what I can tell he’s a drug addict and is involved with some kind of gang or something, and that is what the police have been focusing on so far. We have evidence to suggest that he has an arrest record for stealing money from other people. I don’t know if you have read the news lately, but this has been going on for quite a while and we have proof that this is not the first time that he has stolen from someone,” said Louise.<br><br>George was silent for a while before speaking again.<br><br>“This is ridiculous! He isn’t going to be convicted for taking some money from a woman who was walking down the street! This is a joke, right?” said George.<br><br>Louise paused again before responding.<br><br>“I mean, it isn’t a joke, I will be prosecuting him in court on Monday. There is evidence that he committed the  crime and we have you as a witness who saw it happen, so I don’t see how we can lose. We just need to make sure that John Doe has no opportunity to sway the jury to think otherwise,” said Louise.<br><br>“Seriously though, he wasn’t even trying to kill her or anything. If he had wanted to hurt her, he would have done it much more quickly, wouldn’t he? I don’t see how this is going to result in a conviction. What is the worst case scenario for him? I mean, if we were able to come up with some kind of arrangement with the judge or something, couldn’t we make this all go away? I’d be willing to pay a little bit of money to make sure this doesn’t go any further,” said George.<br><br>Louise Spencer paused again before responding. She moved her fingers across the table, drumming them on its surface as she thought about what to say.<br><br>“I appreciate that you are concerned for John Doe’s well-being here, but we can’t let payment dictate who we prosecute and how seriously we do it. This office has a responsibility to the entire community. We aren’t here to serve the interests of private individuals or corporations—we are here to uphold the law and ensure justice for all,” she said.<br><br>“Okay, I understand that this office has an obligation to the community or whatever, but if you think about it, sending him to jail will only make things worse for him. You have to understand—I wasn’t there when they moved him to this office from the precinct, but a lot of his friends were. They said that he was pretty out of it when they put him in this room. They said they had to strap him down in a chair and he was drooling and foaming at the mouth. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that moving him from the cell to this office probably didn’t do him any good. Right? I mean, if you’re going to move him here, at least move him to a room where he can lie down. Or give him something to drink or something. Don’t just leave him here to rot, you know?”<br><br>Louise Spencer considered this statement for a moment before responding, “I don’t know what  happened when they moved him here, but this office can’t be responsible for the care of criminals. He was apprehended and brought here based on the evidence collected by police officers. The law says he should be prosecuted and that is exactly what we are going to do. There is no excuse for what he did, and the court will rule accordingly. And if you really care about this man, you’ll do your best to help him in court.”<br><br>Tony Wagner stared solemnly at his client for a few seconds before speaking. “You know, not once did you mention that John Doe has been charged with a crime. You didn’t even acknowledge that he’s in this room because of what happened on the street. I think you might want to say something about that.”<br><br>Louise raised her eyebrows and walked over to the window separating them from the courtroom. “Forget it. We all know why John Doe is here. He’s being charged with attempted murder, and if they don’t convict him, the court system has gone to hell in a handbasket, that’s all I have to say.”<br><br>They moved back into the office and sat down. Their conversation was interrupted by Judge Spencer, who burst through the door, leaving a trail of papers behind him. He looked like he was ready to tear someone apart at the seams for stepping on his paper trail. “Court is starting in five minutes and everybody  needs to be there!”<br><br>Tony nodded his head, acknowledging the papers and then said, “Louise, you should probably go.”<br><br>She stood up and looked out the window. “I’m not going to that trial. I’m not prosecuting John Doe. I’m not calling any of the witnesses. But this case isn’t just about John Doe. It’s about Mary Smith, too. It’s about all of us, and how we treat each other in this city—and I didn’t see you doing anything to help Mary Smith when she was walking home last night.”<br><br>Tony was surprised. “What—what are you talking about? What are you talking about, Louise? This is a trial, don’t get crazy.”<br><br>She turned back to face him. “I want to tell Mary Smith’s story. I want to get up there and talk about how she lives with her husband in a tiny apartment that’s falling down around them, and she has to walk home at night by herself because they can’t afford a taxi or a car or even a good pair of shoes—is that crazy enough for you?”<br><br>Tony didn’t know what to say. He said, “I don’t think so. It sounds like you are going off on a tangent here, and I don’t think this is the right way to go about this.”<br><br>Louise was quiet for a moment, then said, “I’ve talked to Jessica Doe. She needs to be heard in all this too. You know she can’t speak English. She barely speaks at all, in fact—and now she’s in the jury room waiting for this verdict to come down and it doesn’t even seem to have occurred to any of you that she might hear what we say here today. Well it occurred to Jessica, and I thought you should know that. She heard everything you said yesterday. She heard everything Mary Smith said today . And she’s expecting us to give it her straight—not like a bunch of lawyers in a bar playing parlor games.”<br><br>Tony said nothing but stood there looking at Louise, his mouth hanging open. “Are you saying that you think she can understand English?”<br><br>Louise shook her head. “No. I’m saying that she is listening to everything very carefully and she has a right to an accounting of everything we do here today. She is your client’s wife, Tony, and this isn’t just about protecting John Doe from her influence, trust me. John Doe is not the only one in this room who needs protection from the people he loves.”<br><br>Tony Wagner had no response to that and turned toward the jury box. “Your Honor, will you please instruct them to wait outside for a few minutes while I talk to counsel?” John Doe looked confused by this request.<br><br>Louise shook Tony Wagner’s arm and tried to drag him the last few steps back to her bench, but he resisted her efforts and turned on his heels toward the jury box instead.<br><br>John Doe was confused by this request.  “Your Honor, may I ask the witness some questions?”<br><br>Tony Wagner ignored John Doe and continued to stare at Louise as his mouth twisted into a sneer. “Louise, as one of the brightest young lawyers I know, you know full well that Mr. Doe is not allowed to cross-examine Mrs. Smith. Our rules are perfectly clear on this point: neither the defendant nor anyone in his family is allowed to question any of the witnesses against him.” He paused and looked pointedly at John Doe for a moment before adding, “That would include a spouse.”<br><br>Louise did not respond, but her eyes narrowed behind the lenses of her glasses as she tried to keep herself under control.<br><br>The judge looked over his glasses in irritation. “Defense counsel, let’s make this simple: you know the rules just as well as I do; there will be no more interruptions.”<br><br>Tony Wagner nodded his agreement and turned back to face the jury with a look of contempt on his face. “George Smith, do you remember your testimony from yesterday?”<br><br>“Yes, I remember it very well.” George Smith shifted nervously in his seat, but spoke in a clear voice.<br><br>George Smith testified that he saw the entire incident and that he was certain that the person who had tried to mug his wife was John Doe. He testified that he had seen it all clearly due to the fact that it had happened right in front of his face .<br><br>The prosecutor rested his case, and John Doe’s lawyer made a last-minute effort to convince the judge that there was one more witness they wanted to call. It was only after a moment’s hesitation that the judge reluctantly agreed.<br><br>George Smith sat down as a young man entered the courtroom and walked up to the witness stand. He was someone Tony Wagner had mentioned in his opening statement, but Mary and Jessica had never seen him before.<br><br>The young man cleared his throat and took off his glasses as he began to speak. “My name is Jeffrey Black, and I used to be the prison guard who was assigned to supervise John Doe before he was moved from our cellblock to solitary confinement.”<br><br>“What did you do with John Doe?” The judge asked.<br><br>“At first, we moved him to a holding cell near the entrance of the prison so that his case could be investigated. After that, he was transferred to a cellblock in solitary confinement and kept there until we received orders to transfer him elsewhere, which we did a few months back.”<br><br>“Did you ever speak with John Doe?” Tony Wagner asked.<br><br>“Yes, I did. He was a model prisoner, always following the rules and maintaining a positive attitude.",1
Trevor Lockwood ends up being a serial killer who lures women to their death and Natalie narrowly escapes becoming his next victim .,"to realize that she had been played. Trevor had lured her out to his home under false pretenses with the hopes that she would sleep with him. Natalie figured that he might have been trying to rape her, since she was stuck out in the middle of nowhere with no means of escape and a man who wanted to hurt her.<br><br>After a few weeks, Natalie moved to a city close by. She never told anyone about what Trevor Lockwood had done to her, not even her closest friends. She was ashamed of what had happened to her and she thought people would think less of her if they knew that she had slept with a man in order to get money. She had played Trevor Lockwood and now she felt like he was playing her, this time by trying to lure her into his home where he could kill her.<br><br>Natalie Harper’s home was a modest one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of a city. She had moved to the city so that she could get a job at a grocery store closer to her home.<br><br>She moved in with some friends from her hometown, but three months later she found herself living alone again due to disagreements over money and rent with her roommates. She had found the apartment after being referred there by  the manager at a local grocery store where she worked.<br><br>Natalie had been working as a cashier at the grocery store for about two months when she ran into Trevor Lockwood again, who wanted to set up another meeting with her. Natalie declined. Trevor persisted, sending Natalie emails that were rude and pushy.<br><br>Eventually Natalie changed her mind, realizing that she needed the money to pay her bills. Trevor Lockwood had offered her a job working as a model for his modeling agency. She was reluctant at first but decided to give it a try because it paid well and she would be able to quit her job at the grocery store, which Natalie realized that she didn’t care much for.<br><br>Natalie agreed to meet Trevor Lockwood at a local restaurant and discuss the offer in person.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood was a handsome young man with bright eyes and short dark hair. He was about twenty-seven years old Natalie guessed, though she couldn’t be sure. Trevor Lockwood had a confident air about him. He was very persuasive and knew how to work people, Natalie observed. And he seemed like he could be dangerous if provoked, she thought. He definitely wasn’t someone she wanted to cross. But  the money sounded too good to pass up.<br><br>When Natalie arrived at the restaurant, Trevor Lockwood was already sitting at a table, alone. He greeted her with a smile and some small talk about the weather. It was unusually cold and snowing outside for this time of year. Natalie pulled aside her coat to  reveal a tight black dress underneath. The dress was mostly sheer and showed off Natalie’s ample cleavage.<br><br>Trevor Lockwood smiled appreciatively, his eyes taking in every inch of Natalie’s body, lingering on her breasts. After glancing down at her cleavage a few more times Natalie finally pulled the coat back over her chest and pretended to be interested in a news article she had retrieved from the check-stand rack. Trevor Lockwood’s eyes kept darting back to Natalie’s chest, his face flushed with arousal.<br><br>Natalie looked up at Trevor Lockwood and smiled coyly, knowing that she was getting to him. Trevor Lockwood responded by scooting closer to her on the bench seat of his booth. Natalie moved back slightly so that their knees weren’t touching and waited for Trevor Lockwood to continue.<br><br>After some more small talk about Natalie struggling to make rent",1
Jenna Adams meets Brian Johnson and immediately feels drawn to him.,"Jenna Adams was looking around the small, dingy apartment she called home. She rolled her eyes and sighed. She wanted out of this place so badly.<br><br>How did she get stuck in this hell hole, she wondered for the hundredth time. She didn’t have a lot of money, but she was saving as much as possible. With any luck, she’d be able to afford a new place in just a few more months.<br><br>     She was sitting on the couch, reading a romance novel. She hated romance novels, but they seemed like the only reading material she could afford. The people that lived in her building all considered her odd. They had various reasons for that opinion; she didn’t wear much makeup, she dressed simply, and she rarely spoke. She was always reading a book or working on her computer.<br><br>Jenna had been working on her computer for the last two hours. She was trying to get enough money to afford renting an apartment of her own. She needed a good job, but didn’t have much education. She worked at a grocery store, but hardly ever got any hours. The store was open 24 hours a day and seven days a week, but they were only required to provide a certain number of employees. It was hard for Jenna to make enough money with only five shifts a month, so she was looking to get a second job. She was currently working on her resume.<br><br>     Tonight, Jenna had decided to have a quiet night in. She wanted to finish reading her book and work on her resume. Nothing exciting ever happened in Jenna’s life, at least not very often.<br><br>Jenna heard a knock on the door. She jumped up and ran over to it, but by the time she got there, she was too late. The person had already left and closed the door behind them.<br><br>     Jenna looked through the peep hole. It was a man with dark brown hair and blue eyes. He looked very attractive. Jenna was drawn to him immediately, but knew he wasn’t her type. He was too handsome.<br><br>     After about ten minutes, the man knocked again. This time, Jenna opened the door immediately.<br><br>“Can I help you?” she asked.<br><br>“I’m sorry to bother you, but I think I left my phone in your apartment,” he said.<br><br>“I don’t think anyone in this building has a cell phone, so I highly doubt it,” she replied.<br><br>“I’ve been to everyone’s apartment and they all said no, but you were the last place I tried,” he said.<br><br>“I still doubt it, but I can check for you,” Jenna said.<br><br>She walked back into her apartment and looked at the phone on her desk. Just as she suspected, it was missing. She found the number of the person who had called her, and dialed it.<br><br>“Hello,” a woman answered.<br><br>“Do you know who owns this phone?” Jenna asked.<br><br>There was a couple of seconds of silence and then, “Yes, I do.”<br><br>“This is the person I talked to just a few minutes ago. He left it in my apartment by mistake,” Jenna said.<br><br>“Oh, hi, this is the hospital. I was calling you about your test results, but I don’t need to because the doctor wants to see you in his office tomorrow afternoon,” the woman said.<br><br>Jenna was confused. She thought she had an apartment full of uneducated people, but she was pretty sure that woman worked in a hospital.<br><br>“I don’t understand, how did you get my phone number?” Jenna asked.<br><br>“I gave it to him,” the woman replied.<br><br>“Why would you tell him my phone number?” Jenna said.<br><br>“He needed to get ahold of you, but couldn’t find your address, so I gave him your phone number,” she said.<br><br>Jenna was beyond confused. She turned and began to walk back to her apartment door, but the man stopped her by grabbing her arm.<br><br>“Don’t go yet, I need to tell you something,” he said.<br><br>“I don’t have time for this, but please tell me what you have to say and then I will leave,” Jenna said.<br><br>The man smiled at her and sat down on the couch. “My name is Brian Johnson and I am a doctor. I wanted to tell you that you have cancer and that you will be dead in a couple of months. I would recommend that you give up school and get your affairs in order.”<br><br>Jenna was shocked and furious. She turned and started to leave the room.<br><br>“Wait,” Brian said.<br><br>She turned back around and waited for him to speak.<br><br>“It’s okay, I am just pulling your leg. I just wanted to see how you would react,” he said.<br><br>Jenna breathed a sigh of relief. She hadn’t realized it at the time, but she had been holding her breath. She couldn’t believe how scared she had been. She sat down next to him on the couch and they began to talk.<br><br>“So, what’s your story?” Brian asked.<br><br>Jenna was a little stunned by the sudden change of topic, but she thought that maybe he was just trying to get to know her better. “My story?” she said.<br><br>“Yes, I mean you have to be at least twenty-one years old, so there has to be a story there,” Brian answered.",0
"The school is full of dark secrets, and the janitor is the only one who knows the truth.","it was hard. She had just had a fight with her dad, and she wasn’t ready to confront him about it yet. She knew that her mother was right, but she was just too stubborn to tell her that.<br><br>	“I know, Mom, but I’m not ready for this conversation right now. I have work to do and I can’t focus on every little thing. I’m sorry, but I just need to work right now. I’m sorry, but you are going to have to deal with my problems for the time being. I love you, Mom.”<br><br>	“I love you, too. I’ll be back to pick you up in a little while. Don’t stay too late at work.”<br><br>	“I won’t, Mom. Have a good day. I love you.”<br><br>	Anna hung up the phone and went back to her desk to get started on the work that she had to do. She was just going through some of her email when she received an email from Tyler that made her smile.<br><br>	“Hey beautiful,” it said. “I miss you already. Can’t wait to see you. I love you.”<br><br>	Anna smiled as she looked at the email for a moment. She thought about how glad she was that they were able to resolve their issues last night. They were going to be getting married, and they were going to be able to spend all of their time together, and that was exactly what she wanted. She knew that Tyler was her soul mate, and that they were meant to be together. She didn’t know why she was so lucky to have Tyler, but she was, and she was going to enjoy every second of it.<br><br>	“I’ll see you in a few hours, baby,” Tyler said as he walked into the kitchen. “I can’t wait to see you. I feel like we haven’t seen each other in forever.”<br><br>	Anna smiled as she reached for a towel and dried her hands.<br><br>	“I can’t wait to see you either, Tyler. I miss you so much.”<br><br>	“I love you so much, Anna. Thank you for coming home with me, and thank you for loving me like you do. I can’t imagine my life without you anymore.”<br><br>	“I love you so much, Tyler. I can’t imagine my life without you either. You are my soul mate, and I don’t know what I would do without you. I want to spend every day with you, and I want to be able to spend every night with you too.”<br><br>	“I know how you can make that a reality. When we are married nothing will be able to stop us from spending time together. I just can’t wait for us to be husband and wife. I love you, Anna, and I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.”<br><br> 	Anna smiled as she walked over to Tyler and leaned in to kiss him. She could feel his hands running up and down her arms.<br><br>	“I love you more, Tyler. So tell me, do you want to get married today?” she said as she pulled back.<br><br>	“I don’t know about today, but I definitely want to marry you sooner rather than later.”<br><br>	“Okay then. Let me get some things together so that we can go surprise Mom and Dad.”<br><br>	Tyler smiled and helped Anna gather up some clothes and her toiletries so that they could go tell Anna’s parents that they were getting married.<br><br>	When Anna and Tyler arrived at Anna’s house she was surprised to see her mom sitting in the car. She and her dad had just finished discussing Tyler last night, and now she was here to meet him.<br><br>“What are you doing here?” Anna asked.<br><br>Anna’s mom laughed. “Your father and I talked all night about you and Tyler. He thinks that you two are the most perfect couple in the world, but he wants to make sure that you are happy, and I couldn’t agree more.”<br><br>“We are happy, Mom. He is my soul mate, and I can’t imagine my life without him.”<br><br>Anna’s mom smiled warmly as she walked over to the car. “Well, now that we have that out of the way, do you want to go tell your dad and I that you are getting married today?”<br><br>Anna laughed. 	“We would love to tell you, but we are hoping that you will be able to make it work.”<br><br>“Are you kidding? I would never miss this.”<br><br>“What about your job?” Tyler asked.<br><br>Anna’s mom smiled. “I am taking a sabbatical for a year, and then I’ll go back to work. Don’t think that I have forgotten that you and Tyler want kids. I wouldn’t miss this for the world.”<br><br>Anna hugged her mother tightly. “You are the best mother in the whole wide world. I love you so much, Mom, and I want you to be at my wedding.”<br><br>Anna and Tyler decided to wait until their wedding to tell Anna’s parents that they were pregnant. It was too good of a surprise for them to be told before the wedding. The last thing that they wanted was for their parents to be disappointed in them.<br><br>	They went inside and met her dad, who was just as excited as her mother to hear that Anna and Tyler were getting married.<br><br>	It was going to be a wonderful day, and Anna couldn’t wait for it to begin.",0
Daisy Mayberry receives a diagnosis of cancer and her family and friends come together to support her.,"“Daisy!”<br><br>	I looked over at my best friend, Melissa. She was waving her hands in the air and jumping up and down.<br><br>	“What are you doing?” I asked with a laugh.<br><br>	“I just love you so much!” she said as she wrapped her arms around me. Her long, blonde hair hung down and covered our faces as we embraced each other. I could smell the lavender vanilla lotion on her.<br><br>	“I love you too,” I whispered into her ear.<br><br>	“So what are we going to do tomorrow night?” she asked, pulling away from me. I looked up at the sky to try and find some stars that might give us some answers. “I know! Let’s go sky diving!”<br><br>	“Let me think about it,” I said with a smile. “I have to ask my mom if we can borrow her car. If you can get your mom’s car then I think we could do it.”<br><br>	“You know she’ll say yes!” Melissa said as she pushed up her glasses that were falling down her nose. She had always been a nerd. She wore glasses since the first grade, her long blonde hair in braids and she had a small nose that was always red from blowing it.<br><br>	I was the exact opposite. I had short, black hair that I wore straight down to my chin. I had braces and my nose always seemed to be clear. Even though we were so different, we were still best friends. We did everything together and she was like a sister to me.<br><br>	“Come on, let’s go over to your house and get your mom’s car,” I said with a laugh. Her home came into view and I slowed down so we wouldn’t be too loud when we pulled into her driveway.<br><br>	We slowly pulled up to her house in my car, a 1972 cherry red Mustang. My mom had driven it when she was younger and she gave it to me when I turned 16. She said it was the best birthday present she could have given me.<br><br>	We got out of the car and walked up to her front door.<br><br>	“I’ll get it,” Melissa said as she knocked on the door. “Just give me a second.”<br><br>	I heard the door unlock and Melissa pushed it open. She walked in and I followed behind her.<br><br>	“We’re just going to go get my mom’s car,” I said to her parents.<br><br>	“Okay, honey, just be back by 11:00,” her dad said.<br><br>	“Yes, sir,” I replied.<br><br>	“Have fun, you two. I’m glad you guys are best friends again,” her mom said as she walked past us to the kitchen. “I know they didn’t like each other when they were younger. It’s kind of funny that they became best friends now that they’re in high school.”<br><br>	Melissa and I laughed as we walked out of the house and got into my car. We waved to her parents as we pulled out of the driveway and headed down the street to her house.<br><br>	“You know, it really is a coincidence that we became best friends at this age,” Melissa said as we pulled into her driveway. “We were so different when we were younger. I’m just glad we’re best friends again.”<br><br>	“Me too!” I said as I got out of the car.<br><br>	We closed the garage door and walked into her house. I stepped into her room and looked around at all of her posters on the wall and her small collection of Beanie Babies lying on her shelf.<br><br>	She walked over to her desk, grabbed the keys to her parents’ car and came back toward me.<br><br>	“You want to get my car?” she asked as she handed me the keys. “I have to get something out of my room.”<br><br>	“Sure,” I said as I grabbed the keys from her. “Why don’t you show me some of your Beanie Babies while I wait?”<br><br>	She rolled her eyes and muttered under her breath before walking out of the room. A few minutes later, she came back with a handful of Beanie Babies in her hand. “I have these, these, these and these,” she said as she tried to squeeze them into her hand.<br><br>	We walked out of the house and into the garage. I opened up my driver’s side door and fumbled around with the keys.<br><br>	“Hey! I’ll get it,” Melissa said from beside my car.<br><br>	“Thanks,” I replied as I sat down on the tailgate.<br><br>	She walked over to my car and unlocked it. She opened the door and grabbed the items I needed to get out.<br><br>	“Why don’t you drive?” she asked me as she handed me the items. “I don’t want to mess up your car with my messy purse.”<br><br>	“Okay, thanks,” I said as I grabbed the items and got into the car.<br><br>	I started the car and pulled out of the driveway. I drove down the street toward her parent’s house.<br><br>	I pulled the car into her parent’s driveway and we walked inside.<br><br>	“Hey, Melissa, is your Mom home?” I asked her dad as we walked in.<br><br>	“She went to the grocery store,” he replied. “She should be back pretty soon. Why? Is there something you need?”",1
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.",".<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky looked at the picture again and said, “I don’t understand the point of this.”<br><br>	“It’s pretty easy to understand,” said the Mayor. “The killer is a cat, just like you. And he hates dogs because they kill his people. In the morning, when you go to the dog park, he wants you to feel as though you are losing part of your family.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “That doesn’t make any sense. I have nothing to do with this killer. I have never even seen him before.”<br><br>	The Mayor sat back in his chair and said, “That’s because he has been coming to the park at night when you aren’t there. He is trying to incite a war between dogs and cats.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky looked at the Mayor and said, “I have never seen this man before, how do you know he’s a cat?”<br><br>	The Mayor picked up another picture off of his desk and said, “You probably haven’t seen him before because he has been watching you for several weeks.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky looked at the picture of the man and said, “What is this?”<br><br>	“That is a picture of him,” said the Mayor. “He was the one who planted the catnip in your house.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky narrowed his eyes and said, “So, you think I have been corrupted by this man? I am offended that you would think me so weak.”<br><br>	The Mayor stood up from his chair and said, “Kitty, I didn’t mean to imply that. I was simply stating a fact that he has been corrupting you.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “He has been corrupting my family?”<br><br>	“Yes,” said the Mayor.<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky stood up from his chair and walked around the desk. He picked up a picture off of the Mayor’s desk and handed it to him.<br><br>	“Who is this?” asked the Mayor.<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “It’s me.”<br><br>	The Mayor looked at the picture and said, “You?”<br><br>	Kitty nodded his head and said, “I looked at this picture before I went to bed last night. This is what you are looking at right now.”<br><br>	The Mayor nodded his head and said, “So you are telling me I am looking at you in the flesh?”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky nodded his head and said, “Yes. Look at my left ear.  You can see the little earring I have.”<br><br>	The Mayor looked at the picture and then back at Kitty Pawsky. He said, “Kitty, you don’t have an earring.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “No. It’s not an earring, it’s a little piece of string I found when I was looking for food. It may have been a piece of dental floss.”<br><br>	The Mayor shook his head and said, “Kitty… I appreciate your honesty… but you have been corrupted by this man. I am going to have to suspend you if you continue to associate with him.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “Mayor, I don’t know where he is. If I could tell you where he is…”<br><br>	The Mayor jumped up from his chair and said, “Well, let me call a detective to help you find him.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “Mayor, I know where he is. He’s at my house.”<br><br>	The Mayor sat back down in his chair and said, “You know where he is?”<br><br>	Kitty nodded his head and said, “Yes, he’s at my house. He… well… he was a good friend of mine.”<br><br>	The Mayor shook his head and said, “You mean before he planted drugs in your house and caused a murder?”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky said, “Well… yes. I guess so. He was a good friend of mine before that.”<br><br>	The Mayor got up from his chair and said, “How do I know that you won’t kill me if I let you go home?”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky laughed and said, “I can’t tell you that.”<br><br>	The Mayor sat back down in his chair and said, “That’s what I thought. You’re off the force. Good bye, Kitty.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky nodded his head and said, “Mayor, I think you should reconsider my suspension. I know where he is and I can get him to turn himself in.”<br><br>	The Mayor shook his head and said, “I don’t trust you.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky stood up from his chair and said, “Mayor, I would never kill anybody. He may have planted drugs in my house, but I wouldn’t kill anybody.”<br><br>	The Mayor nodded his head and said, “Look, I can’t call this meeting of the Town Council back together again if you do this.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky sighed and said, “Well, that’s true. Okay. I will let",0
Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"<br><br>Jenna looked around her. The room was filled with several beds and the odd piece of equipment. There were curtains on most of the windows, but one was wide open and showed a brick wall outside. She looked back at Liam before speaking again. “What’s your name?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam smiled at that. “My name is Liam Cross, and I promise that I will not hurt you, no matter what anyone else tells you.”<br><br>Jenna thought about things for a few more seconds before asking another question. “Does everyone become a vampire? Is that what this is?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam shook his head. “Most people don’t become vampires, and it is definitely not something that you want to happen to you,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna looked at him curiously before asking a question that she had been thinking about for the last several minutes. “Where am I? How did I get here?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam stared at her for a moment. “You are in the hospital,” said Liam, answering her second question first. “The police found you in an alley.”<br><br>Jenna looked at him to make sure he was telling the truth. She looked at the room around her, and then back at Liam. “Where is everyone else? I don’t see anyone else here,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam smiled for a moment before shaking his head. “You’re the only person here, right now, but the police are looking for other people who might have been with you at the time of your attack that they might have left behind. You were there quite a while before they found you, and you’re very lucky to be alive,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna looked around the room again, and then back at him. “I don’t understand what happened to me, but I feel like it was more than being attacked and left for dead in an alley,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam nodded for a moment before speaking again. “You are right about that, although I don’t know everything about what happened either,” said Liam. He pulled his jacket out from where he kept it under the chair by his bed, and handed it to  her. “When we meet someone for the first time, as is customary in our kind of society, we give them something small as a token of trust. I hope this isn’t too much for you to carry around with you,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna took the jacket from him and slipped it on. It fit her perfectly, almost as if it was made for her. “No, not at all. Thank you,” said Jenna as she smiled and looked back at him.<br><br>He nodded for a few minutes before speaking again. “I want to tell you something else that might answer some questions you have,” said Liam. “When a vampire is about to change, we experience a few events that give us more insight into what is coming. You were probably going through this and may have not realized it, or just forgot about it. When I saw you in the alley, I knew exactly who you were and what had just happened to you,” said Liam as he leaned back more comfortably into his chair.<br><br>Jenna leaned forward slightly in her seat as she listened intently to what he was saying. She took a moment to think about what he said and decided to ask him a question as she leaned back in her chair. “In other words, you knew I was going to turn into a vampire,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam looked up at the ceiling for a few seconds, and then looked back at her. “Yes, that is sort of what I’m saying. We all go through this when we are about to change,” he said as he looked back over at the front door.<br><br>Jenna shifted her eyes from one side of the room to another as she thought about how Elijah Sedgew ick might take what Liam was saying. She turned to look at the clock on the wall as she realized that it was late, and Elijah would be coming in soon if he wasn’t there already.<br><br>She turned away from the clock and back at Liam, who was still watching her carefully. “Where did you say you met each other?” asked Jenna as she shifted her weight in the chair.<br><br>“We met on the train to New York,” he said with a slight nod of his head. “I had just gotten on board and sat down in a seat next to you, as I was already quite tired from the trip up from Virginia. When I sat down you turned to look at me, and then took your phone out of your pocket and started typing away.”<br><br>Jenna listened as Liam spoke about their first meeting, but was having trouble picturing it in her mind. “Wait a minute,” she said as she looked at the clock and then back at Liam. “Are you saying that I got on this train by myself? When you first walked in here, I thought that I had been taken over by a vampire or something.”<br><br>Liam nodded. “Yes, and I know why you would think that. It is one of the things that leads up to a vampire’s transformation. They feel as if they are not traveling alone and have company with them on their journey, but when they look around they realize that no one else is there.”<br><br>Jenna nodded her head slowly trying to absorb everything Liam was telling her. “So that’s why I thought there was someone else in here with me?”<br><br>He nodded again. “It is possible because you were heading to New York, and I know that Antonia Rossi lives in New York. She is a very powerful vampire. She is the only person right now who holds the allegiance of most of the vampires in this country. She holds sway over a large number of vampires, both here and abroad. Every vampire who has turned to her for protection has been transformed into her kind. You have to go to New York and find her. She will be able to help you.”<br><br>Jenna moved away from the door, turning her back on Liam as she slid down until she was sitting on the floor in front of one of the seats. “New York ? What about Liam? I thought he was going with me.”<br><br>He shook his head solemnly. “I wish that I could, Jenna, but I can’t. Antonia is very powerful and has vast connections to all sorts of dark forces. If she finds out about me, then they will know that I am here. There wouldn’t be any point in traveling to NYC and going to her if she finds out that I am here. She would come looking for me immediately and, in the process, she would kill you.”<br><br>Jenna closed her eyes as she sighed heavily with resignation. “What’s the connection between Damian Henchman and Antonia? Why is he important to her?”<br><br>Liam looked at Jenna with a solemn expression as he said, “Damian is a vampire who has been to Italy recently. I think that you should go to Italy and find out if there are any clues to help you about your attacker. You could try New York first, but I think that it would be better if you went to Italy because it is less far away. Plus, it is closer to home for you",1
A group of survivors find themselves holed up in an old house in the middle of nowhere.,"It was all silent for the first time in a long, long time.<br><br>	A silence that should have never, ever been broken.<br><br>	A silence that should have never, ever been disturbed.<br><br>	A silence of life.<br><br>	Riley looked around the large, dark room. There was nothing but darkness, and one figure, sitting against the wall in the corner, wearing a brown jacket.<br><br>	I knew she was there.<br><br>	I knew she was thinking about what to do.<br><br>	And I couldn’t blame her.<br><br>	She stood up, brushed off her pants, and walked towards us.<br><br>	“I know it’s hard.” She said, stopping in front of me. “The first time is the hardest. But it will get easier.” She said, slowly looking across at me and then away. “I know you don’t want to do this, but we have to survive. There’s no other way.”<br><br>	I started nodding, accepting the fact that she was right.<br><br>	“Go on, then. It won’t get easier. Trust me. But it will get easier.” She said, moving her hands towards her pockets. I stood up, putting my hand on my knife. She reached into her pockets, pulled out a roll of duct tape and a scalpel. I felt my body tense up, and my heart started beating faster and faster…<br><br>	“You don’t have to do this alone.” She said, moving towards me. I flicked my knife out of its sheath, holding it in front of me.<br><br>	“You’re right.” I said, watching her carefully as she stepped around the room, making sure that she didn’t turn around. “I don’t.”<br><br>	I waited for a few seconds, seeing her take out another scalpel and tape from her pockets.<br><br>	“Are you ready?” She asked. I nodded, watching her carefully as she moved forward. I held my knife up a little higher in my hand. “Go on, then.” She said in a soft voice, looking down at the floor.<br><br>	I felt my body tense up and my heart rate speed up….<br><br>Chapter 1: A New Beginning<br><br>	I watched as the body fell to the floor. It had been a while since I had done anything like this, and I had forgotten how difficult it was.<br><br>	I looked up at the body in front of me, lying on the floor with its chest open and a knife in its heart. The tape and scalpel lay beside it.<br><br>	“Well done, Riley.” I heard someone say. I looked up, and saw someone with a red jacket walk towards me. It was one of the others, named Anna. She was nice, but never liked me much.<br><br>	“Thanks. You should be doing this too.” I said to her, smiling a little as I looked away from her at the body.<br><br>	“I don’t like doing it. But we need to make sure there aren’t any more of them.” She said, walking slowly towards me and putting her hand on my shoulder to make sure I was okay. I pulled away from her, pushing myself off the floor and wiping my knife off on my pants.<br><br>	“It’s not that bad…” I said quietly, trying to ignore her. “It makes sure that they don’t get the chance to hurt you.” I said, looking down as my body started to tense up again.<br><br>	She smiled and nodded, slowly heading towards the body and putting her hand on its arm. “I guess so…” She said, pulling out a small knife and walking towards the body.<br><br>	I watched as she put the knife into the chest of the body, pulling it out and stabbing it into the arm on the other side. I felt my body tense up even more, as I had to think about how she was doing it. I stayed back from her, watching as she cut into the chest again.<br><br>	“We should do this together.” I said, smiling a little. I knew that we wouldn’t be able to work together, as neither of us trusted each other.<br><br>	I watched as she looked up at me and nodded.<br><br>	“Okay… Let’s do it together.” She said slowly, looking over at me. She stopped cutting into the chest, and pulled out another scalpel and duct tape from her pockets. “How do you want to work this?” She asked. I looked down at the ground, thinking about what she had said. I tried to decide whether I was going to try and have her get me, or if I was going to try and get her. I decided that she was probably going to be harder to kill than me, but that she wouldn’t expect it.<br><br>	“You go first. I’ll walk over and get you once you start stabbing the body.” I said, looking up at her. I watched as she nodded and started walking over to the body.<br><br>	I watched as she slowly walked over to the body, slowly pulling out another knife from her pocket. She looked at the body, and started walking towards it slowly. She took out her knife and started cutting into the chest slowly, making sure that she didn’t cut me and that I would be able to get her. After a few seconds, she turned around and ran towards me, cutting into the chest.

"However, when Brian Johnson's ex-girlfriend shows up and tries to win him back, Jenna Adams realizes that marriage isn't for her after all and that it's better to be alone than with someone who doesn't truly love you.","next Tuesday, instead. It will give me more time to prepare anyway,” Brian said. “Well, I’ll see you both next week then. I have some work I need to do, so I’ll let you two talk. I hope you don’t have anything important to tell me,” he said, walking out of the room.<br><br>“No, nothing important,” Jenna said with a smile.<br><br>The woman looked at her and smiled as well. “Oh, good. I was afraid to ask if you had heard anything from him. My name is Jenna too,” she said.<br><br>Jenna smiled back at her and said, “Don’t worry. When Brian has something to tell you, you’ll know it right away. He can’t keep a secret to save his life.”<br><br>“Really? Then I should probably be careful about what I tell him about my life,” the woman said, laughing. “Good luck, Jenna.”<br><br>Then she left Brian’s office and closed the door behind her.<br><br>Jenna sat there for a few minutes, thinking about everything she had just heard. Then, she heard the door open again, and she looked up at Brian.<br><br>“I’m sorry for that. My ex-girlfriend is a little crazy and wanted to know why I hadn’t called her in the last few days. I hope I didn’t say anything that made you upset,” Brian said.<br><br>Jenna smiled and shook her head. “No, you didn’t upset me at all. You can tell me about your ex-girlfriend later, if you want. For now, how about we get started?” she said.<br><br>“Good idea,” Brian said and sat back down in his chair. Then, he looked at the papers on his desk to make sure he wouldn’t miss anything important.<br><br>Jenna leaned back in her chair and folded her hands in front of her, waiting for Brian to get started. She knew that she liked him very much, and she was interested to see how their date would end tonight. It was getting much later than either of them had expected, but Jenna didn’t care. She knew that if she had met the right man, she would be willing to stay out all night.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Jenna’s Story - Back to the Beginning of the Date:<br><br>“Good. I’m looking forward to it,” she said, walking over to the front door with him. I wonder if he can really get me to laugh that much, she thought as they walked outside.<br><br>When they got there, Brian took her hand and led her over to the Mustang and opened the door for her.<br><br>“Thank you, but I can open my own door,” she said, smiling at him. Then she got into the car and closed the door.<br><br>Brian looked at her for a moment and smiled. “Okay if I drive?” he asked, getting in the car behind the steering wheel.<br><br>“Sure, go ahead and drive,” she said.<br><br>He started up the car and backed out of the parking space with no problem at all. He made a right towards the street and then got onto Route 295.<br><br>“So, how do you like your job at the office?” Brian asked, looking over at her.<br><br>“I like it. It can be boring at times, but I enjoy the people I work with, especially Brian Johnson. He’s a great boss,” she said, smiling at him again.<br><br>Brian smiled back at her and looked down at his side of the steering wheel for a moment. “I was hoping that you would get along with him and that he would like you. I think you’d be perfect for each other.”<br><br>Jenna looked over at him and asked, “Why do you say that?”<br><br>“Because you two are very similar. You both come from the same small town and you both like to laugh,” he said.<br><br>“I guess he’s a lot like me, but I don’t know if I’d call us two peas in a pod, like he did this morning,” Jenna said.<br><br>Then she watched as Brian drove the car off the exit and onto the road that led towards Mount Charleston. She had seen that road several times before, but she had never been on it before. She looked at Brian and wondered who owned the house they were going to, and then she remembered that he had said it was his.<br><br>“I still can’t believe you own this house,” Jenna said.<br><br>“I know it’s kind of hard to believe. I bought it a few years ago with some money I had saved up,” he said.<br><br>“You own this whole house?”<br><br>“Yes. It’s just the two bedrooms and the living room, but it was cheap to buy. That’s why I bought it,” he explained.<br><br>“That’s awesome,” Jenna said, looking out the window at the houses and the trees along the road. I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised that Brian owns a house like this. He does seem to make a lot of money. At least he’s not like most of the men I know, she thought.<br><br>She noticed that they were getting closer to the house and said, “I’m looking forward to seeing your house.”<br><br>Brian looked at her and smiled again. “I think you’ll like it. I’m not sure what the kitchen looks like",1

She knew that John Doe was gone.  Her only chance of surviving was in the morning, when she would be able to hear them.  They would probably take turns with her all night long.  She knew that she was going to die.<br><br>  “Oh,” she said, trying to stay calm.<br><br>  There was a pounding on the door.<br><br>  “Come in,” John Doe said from outside the basement door.<br><br>  It opened and closed again.<br><br>  The man and woman from the corner of the basement were brought into the room.<br><br>  She saw John Doe walk over to the man and cut his throat with a knife.<br><br>  He then went over to the woman and did the same thing.<br><br>  “You two have been very bad,” he said.<br><br>  They were both dead, but Valerie was still alive.  She was going to die tonight.<br><br>  He dragged her body over to the man and forced her head between his legs.<br><br>  Valerie tried to get up, but he was too strong for her.  She felt the knife come up under her chin and then saw a spray of blood.  When she looked up from the man’s legs, she saw that John Doe was holding the knife and looking right at her.<br><br>  “Don’t worry,” he said.  “I won’t kill you in front of your friends.  You have to leave this basement by dawn or else you will be my next trophy.  Don’t think that I won’t kill you.  I’m a serial killer.  Remember that.”<br><br>  He left, shutting the door behind him.<br><br>  “Ah!” Valerie yelled, reaching down to her neck and finding blood there.  She then felt two more spots on the back of her head where she was cut as well.  She was bleeding from three areas and knew that she wouldn’t make it until dawn if she didn’t get help.<br><br>  She heard a noise from the corner of the basement and turned her head to look over there.  There, sitting on the ground, was a woman.  She had been crying and was just sitting there.  Valerie started to scream for help, but was cut short by a hand across her mouth.<br><br>  “Valerie?” the woman asked.<br><br>  “Mary,” she said.  “Help me!”<br><br>  She looked up to see that Mary’s hands were tied behind her back and that she had been crying as well.  She had a cut on her neck, but was still alive.<br><br>  “I can’t help you,” Mary said.<br><br>  “Why not?” Valerie asked.<br><br>  “I’m tied to the chair,” she said.<br><br>  Valerie looked over to see that she was right.  It had been too dark for her to see it before.  Mary looked over and saw that Valerie had been cut too.<br><br>  “I’m sorry,” Mary said.<br><br>  “I need to get out of here,” Valerie said.<br><br>  “I agree,” Mary said.<br><br>  “Do you have anything sharp that you can use to cut the rope?” Valerie asked.<br><br>  “No, I don’t,” Mary said.<br><br>  “But I do,” a man’s voice said from behind them.<br><br>  Valerie and Mary turned to see John Doe standing behind them.<br><br>  “You,” Valerie said.<br><br>  “Yes, you Valerie,” he said.<br><br>  “It was you who cut my neck,” she said.<br><br>  “It was, but you won’t die until dawn, so I had to take care of your friend here first,” he said.<br><br>  “You monster,” Mary said.<br><br>  “I am, but I won’t kill either of you until sunrise,” he said.  “However, you need to get out of this basement before then.”<br><br>  “How do we do that?” Valerie asked.<br><br>  “You can figure it out,” he said.<br><br>  Mary started to cry again and Valerie could tell that she was scared.<br><br>  “Come here,” John Doe said.<br><br>  Valerie could see that he was holding a knife in his hands.  She knew that it was just a matter of time before he cut Mary’s throat.  He walked over to the chair where Mary was sitting and started to cut the rope on her hands.<br><br>  “What are you doing?” Valerie asked.<br><br>  “I am cutting your friend loose,” he said, “but you only have twenty-four hours to escape.  Are we clear?”<br><br>  “Yes,” Valerie said.<br><br>  Mary was finally free and ran over to the corner of the basement where Valerie was.  Valerie saw that she had blood on her neck as well.  “What happened to you?” she asked.<br><br>  “He cut me, but it’s nothing serious,” Mary said.  “What about you?”<br><br>  “He cut my neck, but I’m fine,” Valerie said.<br><br>  Mary saw that Valerie had also been cut on her head.<br><br>  “We need to get out of here, but how do we do that?” Valerie asked.<br><br>  “I don’t know,” Mary said.",0
"Mary Smith, George Smith, Jessica Doe, and John Doe all give testimony in court and John Doe is ultimately convicted and sent to prison.","Wilkinson. Jessica Doe repeated what her husband had said to her about the mugging that night. The only differences between their accounts was that Jessica said George Smith used a gun while John Doe said he used a knife; and that George Smith punched John in the face while John said he just hit him with his fist. Karen Wilkinson thanked her for her time and left her house.<br><br>Karen Wilkinson next went to the police station to get Louise Spencer’s notes on George Smith’s previous interview. She found that Louise had done extensive research on George Smith and had discovered many of his financial troubles. She also found out that he had moved a lot in his life, having moved at least five times in the past ten years.<br><br>Louise Spencer was waiting for her in the interrogation room. She was a tall, dark-haired woman who was very attractive. She had a stern look but she was very polite and professional when they moved into the room. The only furnishings in the room were two plastic chairs placed in front of a small table.<br><br>“Thank you for coming by, Miss Wilkinson. I had hoped to question you earlier, but the interrogation ran longer than expected.”<br><br>“No problem,” said Karen. It was obvious that Louise Spencer was trying hard to make her comfortable during this interrogation.<br><br>“Let us begin then, shall we?” said Louise. “Where were you coming from the night of the mugging?”<br><br>“I was coming from my job at the grocery store. They close the doors at 9 o’clock and I usually try to leave a little early so that I can get there before they lock up the doors. On this particular night, it was hard to leave on time because Mr. Smith and I were having an argument when we got home about his moving to another state. We have been trying to move to another state for the last couple of years but always end up staying here for some reason or another.”<br><br>“Moving to another state seems like a big step. Why do you want to move?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I have a good job here and I don’t want to move away, but my husband wants to move and so we have discussed it over and over again. But he wouldn’t listen to what I had to say this time either, so I  left the house without telling him and decided to walk home because I needed some air.”<br><br>“What did Mr. Smith say when you told him that you were leaving?” asked Louise.<br><br>“He started shouting that I was being disrespectful and then he called me a damn fool!”<br><br>“And what did you do when he said that?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I shouted back at him, but before I knew it he had his gun pointed at me and was demanding my money.”<br><br>Louise looked at George for a long time before she continued.<br><br>“I have a lot of questions about this, Mr. Smith, but before we carry on I need to know whether or not you think Mr. Doe will be convicted for this crime?”<br><br>“I don’t think so, no! He has done this sort of thing before and they let him go,” said George.<br><br>“Why do you think that he will be convicted this time?” asked Louise.<br><br>“I mean, it isn’t like I would really know anything about these things, is it? Do you think he’ll be convicted?” said George.<br><br>Louise was silent for a few seconds.<br><br>“From what I can gather, Mr. Doe has been in trouble before and is often brought in for questioning, but he has never been convicted of anything before now. From what I can tell he’s a drug addict and is involved with some kind of gang or something, and that is what the police have been focusing on so far. We have evidence to suggest that he has an arrest record for stealing money from other people. I don’t know if you have read the news lately, but this has been going on for quite a while and we have proof that this is not the first time that he has stolen from someone,” said Louise.<br><br>George was silent for a while before speaking again.<br><br>“This is ridiculous! He isn’t going to be convicted for taking some money from a woman who was walking down the street! This is a joke, right?” said George.<br><br>Louise paused again before responding.<br><br>“I mean, it isn’t a joke, I will be prosecuting him in court on Monday. There is evidence that he committed the  crime and we have you as a witness who saw it happen, so I don’t see how we can lose. We just need to make sure that John Doe has no opportunity to sway the jury to think otherwise,” said Louise.<br><br>“Seriously though, he wasn’t even trying to kill her or anything. If he had wanted to hurt her, he would have done it much more quickly, wouldn’t he? I don’t see how this is going to result in a conviction. What is the worst case scenario for him? I mean, if we were able to come up with some kind of arrangement with the judge or something, couldn’t we make this all go away? I’d be willing to pay a little bit of money to make sure this doesn’t go any further,” said George.<br><br>Louise Spencer paused again before responding. She moved her fingers across the table, drumming them on its surface as she thought about what to say.<br><br>“I appreciate that you are concerned for John Doe’s well-being here, but we can’t let payment dictate who we prosecute and how seriously we do it. This office has a responsibility to the entire community. We aren’t here to serve the interests of private individuals or corporations—we are here to uphold the law and ensure justice for all,” she said.<br><br>“Okay, I understand that this office has an obligation to the community or whatever, but if you think about it, sending him to jail will only make things worse for him. You have to understand—I wasn’t there when they moved him to this office from the precinct, but a lot of his friends were. They said that he was pretty out of it when they put him in this room. They said they had to strap him down in a chair and he was drooling and foaming at the mouth. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that moving him from the cell to this office probably didn’t do him any good. Right? I mean, if you’re going to move him here, at least move him to a room where he can lie down. Or give him something to drink or something. Don’t just leave him here to rot, you know?”<br><br>Louise Spencer considered this statement for a moment before responding, “I don’t know what  happened when they moved him here, but this office can’t be responsible for the care of criminals. He was apprehended and brought here based on the evidence collected by police officers. The law says he should be prosecuted and that is exactly what we are going to do. There is no excuse for what he did, and the court will rule accordingly. And if you really care about this man, you’ll do your best to help him in court.”<br><br>Tony Wagner stared solemnly at his client for a few seconds before speaking. “You know, not once did you mention that John Doe has been charged with a crime. You didn’t even acknowledge that he’s in this room because of what happened on the street. I think you might want to say something about that.”<br><br>Louise raised her eyebrows and walked over to the window separating them from the courtroom. “Forget it. We all know why John Doe is here. He’s being charged with attempted murder, and if they don’t convict him, the court system has gone to hell in a handbasket, that’s all I have to say.”<br><br>They moved back into the office and sat down. Their conversation was interrupted by Judge Spencer, who burst through the door, leaving a trail of papers behind him. He looked like he was ready to tear someone apart at the seams for stepping on his paper trail. “Court is starting in five minutes and everybody  needs to be there!”<br><br>Tony nodded his head, acknowledging the papers and then said, “Louise, you should probably go.”<br><br>She stood up and looked out the window. “I’m not going to that trial. I’m not prosecuting John Doe. I’m not calling any of the witnesses. But this case isn’t just about John Doe. It’s about Mary Smith, too. It’s about all of us, and how we treat each other in this city—and I didn’t see you doing anything to help Mary Smith when she was walking home last night.”<br><br>Tony was surprised. “What—what are you talking about? What are you talking about, Louise? This is a trial, don’t get crazy.”<br><br>She turned back to face him. “I want to tell Mary Smith’s story. I want to get up there and talk about how she lives with her husband in a tiny apartment that’s falling down around them, and she has to walk home at night by herself because they can’t afford a taxi or a car or even a good pair of shoes—is that crazy enough for you?”<br><br>Tony didn’t know what to say. He said, “I don’t think so. It sounds like you are going off on a tangent here, and I don’t think this is the right way to go about this.”<br><br>Louise was quiet for a moment, then said, “I’ve talked to Jessica Doe. She needs to be heard in all this too. You know she can’t speak English. She barely speaks at all, in fact—and now she’s in the jury room waiting for this verdict to come down and it doesn’t even seem to have occurred to any of you that she might hear what we say here today. Well it occurred to Jessica, and I thought you should know that. She heard everything you said yesterday. She heard everything Mary Smith said today . And she’s expecting us to give it her straight—not like a bunch of lawyers in a bar playing parlor games.”<br><br>Tony said nothing but stood there looking at Louise, his mouth hanging open. “Are you saying that you think she can understand English?”<br><br>Louise shook her head. “No. I’m saying that she is listening to everything very carefully and she has a right to an accounting of everything we do here today. She is your client’s wife, Tony, and this isn’t just about protecting John Doe from her influence, trust me. John Doe is not the only one in this room who needs protection from the people he loves.”<br><br>Tony Wagner had no response to that and turned toward the jury box. “Your Honor, will you please instruct them to wait outside for a few minutes while I talk to counsel?” John Doe looked confused by this request.<br><br>Louise shook Tony Wagner’s arm and tried to drag him the last few steps back to her bench, but he resisted her efforts and turned on his heels toward the jury box instead.<br><br>John Doe was confused by this request.  “Your Honor, may I ask the witness some questions?”<br><br>Tony Wagner ignored John Doe and continued to stare at Louise as his mouth twisted into a sneer. “Louise, as one of the brightest young lawyers I know, you know full well that Mr. Doe is not allowed to cross-examine Mrs. Smith. Our rules are perfectly clear on this point: neither the defendant nor anyone in his family is allowed to question any of the witnesses against him.” He paused and looked pointedly at John Doe for a moment before adding, “That would include a spouse.”<br><br>Louise did not respond, but her eyes narrowed behind the lenses of her glasses as she tried to keep herself under control.<br><br>The judge looked over his glasses in irritation. “Defense counsel, let’s make this simple: you know the rules just as well as I do; there will be no more interruptions.”<br><br>Tony Wagner nodded his agreement and turned back to face the jury with a look of contempt on his face. “George Smith, do you remember your testimony from yesterday?”<br><br>“Yes, I remember it very well.” George Smith shifted nervously in his seat, but spoke in a clear voice.<br><br>George Smith testified that he saw the entire incident and that he was certain that the person who had tried to mug his wife was John Doe. He testified that he had seen it all clearly due to the fact that it had happened right in front of his face .<br><br>The prosecutor rested his case, and John Doe’s lawyer made a last-minute effort to convince the judge that there was one more witness they wanted to call. It was only after a moment’s hesitation that the judge reluctantly agreed.<br><br>George Smith sat down as a young man entered the courtroom and walked up to the witness stand. He was someone Tony Wagner had mentioned in his opening statement, but Mary and Jessica had never seen him before.<br><br>The young man cleared his throat and took off his glasses as he began to speak. “My name is Jeffrey Black, and I used to be the prison guard who was assigned to supervise John Doe before he was moved from our cellblock to solitary confinement.”<br><br>“What did you do with John Doe?” The judge asked.<br><br>“At first, we moved him to a holding cell near the entrance of the prison so that his case could be investigated. After that, he was transferred to a cellblock in solitary confinement and kept there until we received orders to transfer him elsewhere, which we did a few months back.”<br><br>“Did you ever speak with John Doe?” Tony Wagner asked.<br><br>“Yes, I did. He was a model prisoner, always following the rules and maintaining a positive attitude.",1
"Even now, Jack can't help but think that Eliza will answer him back.","else where it is warm and has green fields?”<br><br>Jack shrugged his shoulders. “It’s just the first place that came to mind, Eliza. I don’t want to be here anymore. It reminds me of you too much, and I can’t stand the thought of that.”<br><br>Eliza moved closer to him again.<br><br>“It reminds you of me? You know, Jack, I may be dead, but I can still feel your touch on my skin. I can still feel our bodies pressing together and how strong you were when you made love to me.”<br><br>Jack moved closer to her again, as close as the grave would allow him, and looked into her eyes.<br><br>Jack stared at her for a long moment before saying anything to her. He could feel his heart beat faster as he looked into her beautiful blue eyes and listened to her soft voice.<br><br>“I moved to this place because of you, Eliza. I can’t be here anymore because it is where you died, and that is where I will always remember you. That is where everyone will remember you, and nothing could be more painful than that.”<br><br>Eliza moved her cheek to Jack’s hand while he was still speaking, and she moved her body so that they were pressed against each other.<br><br>“Moving to a new place won’t lessen the pain of losing me, Jack. It won’t make our memories fade away. Moving to a new place – anywhere – will only be a way for you to forget me.”<br><br>Jack moved his hand away from Eliza’s cheek and he placed it on the top of her gravestone. “Moving will be a way for me to get my life back,” he said as he moved his other hand to the gravestone on the other side of Eliza’s grave. “Moving is a way for us to be together again.”<br><br>Eliza could tell that Jack was getting upset with her and she moved her head away from his hand so that she could move to the other side of the gravestone. “It will never be like it used to be,” she said.<br><br>Jack moved closer to Eliza so that they were standing right next to each other once again. “Moving will make it better,” he said as  he reached out to hold her hand.<br><br>Eliza could feel the warmth coming from Jack’s body as his hand reached for hers and she pulled away from him before they touched. “I don’t want you to forget me, Jack,” she said. “I love you and I need you.”<br><br>Jack tried to talk to Eliza once again, but she didn’t say anything and he turned his head so that he could see her face as she looked at him coldly.<br><br>“You just need to get on with your life, Jack,” she said as she took a step away from him. “This is all I can do for you now.”<br><br>Jack tried to talk to her again but Eliza didn’t say anything and she disappeared before he could get a good look at her face. Jack tried to grasp for her hand but she was gone and he stared at the spot where she had stood, trying to understand what was going on.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost had been standing right next to Jack in the graveyard when she spoke to him, but there was no sign of her when he looked  around. He knew that she had gone somewhere because he could feel her presence, but he couldn’t see her any longer.<br><br>Jack walked around the gravestones and looked carefully amongst the grass as if Eliza would suddenly appear and tell him that none of this was real and that he had been dreaming all of it. He couldn’t find Eliza anywhere and she didn’t say anything as he searched, but she did nothing to stop him either.<br><br>It was clear to him that she couldn’t see him any more either. She looked like a ghost to everyone else, but her eyes were open and her ghostly appearance wasn’t accompanied by a translucent white glow like what he had seen in Halloween movies. She was just invisible to everyone except for Jack.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack walked around the graveyard, but he could tell that she was happy with how things had turned out. Eliza’s ghost had been one of the nicest ghosts that he ever knew, and it was wonderful to see her again. She deserved a happy ending and so did he. She didn’t say anything at all during their time in the graveyard. <br><br>Jack watched her for a while longer and then he went over to his car. There was a lot that he wanted to do in the days ahead, but there was also a lot of unfinished business that had to be taken care of before that could happen. Eliza’s ghost didn’t say anything as Jack got into his car, but she was looking at him again.<br><br>Jack wanted to tell her how much he appreciated what she had done for him after he had lost her. He wanted to thank her and ask her if there was any way that she could finish the job so that he wouldn’t have to let go. Jack wanted to tell her that she had done enough and that it was time for him to move on with the rest of his life. He wanted Eliza’s ghost to know that she didn’t have to be invisible any longer, and that she didn’t have to let go.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Eliza, please don’t leave me alone. Let go of me!”<br><br>Eliza said nothing at all.<br><br>Jack said to her, “Let go of me! Let me go! Let go! Please let me go!”<br><br>Jack tried to hold on to her, but she was gone.<br><br>Eliza’s ghost told him not to fight it and asked Jack to let go of what he was holding onto and then move on with his life. Jack asked her why, and Eliza told Jack that she wanted him to let go so that she could finally let go of him.<br><br>Jack’s ghost told Eliza that he didn’t want to move on. He didn’t want to let go of her. He didn’t want to live his  life without her. Eliza asked Jack what he would do if she stayed.<br><br>Jack said to her, “I want you to stay.” He wanted some sort of assurance that the ghost in front of him was really there, and so he asked her to repeat the question.  More quietly this time, she asked again if he wanted her to stay. When Eliza repeated the question a third time, Jack said that he did want her to stay, and so she told him that if he really wanted her to stay then she would.<br><br>Jack took a step toward the gravestone and then stopped. Eliza’s grave, Jack thought with the sudden realization of what he was doing. He was going to visit Eliza’s grave. He wasn’t visiting her body; he was visiting her grave. He was burying her all over again, this time without a body to bury. Jack took another step toward Eliza’s grave and started to weep. “Please don’t go,” he said choking on his words. “Please don’t leave me. Please stay with me. Don’t go away again. Please don’t go away .”<br><br>Eliza said that she wouldn’t leave him and that she would never go away again, but Jack was already moving toward the gravestone. He stopped when he got there and slowly walked around the gravestone looking for her whistle, which Eliza always wore around her neck. With each whistle he blew, Jack felt a hole opening up in his chest.<br><br>Jack found Eliza’s whistle under a rose bush that grew by the gravestone. He picked the rose petals off of it and blew the whistle several times, but when he stopped blowing, he felt empty again. <br><br>Jack blew the whistle one last time and put it in his pocket. The whistle was cold in his hand, and it felt heavy with Eliza’s absence. Jack wiped the tears from his face, put on his coat and left the graveyard feeling as if all hope had been drained from him. He sat down on a park bench and looked up at the winter sky. Jack couldn’t stop thinking about Eliza, but he knew that she was right. It was time for him to let go of his past and move on with his life. But it didn’t mean that he had to like it.<br><br>Jack blew the whistle one more time, and then he put it in his pocket and left the park. He walked for a few blocks until he came to a small flower shop on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street and went inside. Jack bought mums, gardenias, geraniums, and roses and took them back to Eliza’s grave. He arranged the flowers around the base of the headstone and then sat down on the ground and leaned against it.<br><br>Jack stayed there until it started to get dark, and then he got up and brushed the dirt off of his hands. He looked at the headstone one last time and then turned and walked away.",1
The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,"Julia’s mother came into her room, she was surprised to see Julia sitting up in bed, waiting for her.<br><br>“Did you have another bad dream?”<br><br>“Not really, Mommy. I just woke up a little while ago. Do you want to play a game?”<br><br>Julia’s mother again tried to get her daughter to forget about what had happened in the forest. She said that there was no reason for her daughter to worry about anything and that she would take care of things. She said that if Julia ever saw the man again, she should tell her mother right away. Julia promised that she would, but she wondered why her mother was so worried about the man in the car. He didn’t look like a bad man. He just looked like an ordinary man who was driving through town in an ordinary car. Why would it be so bad if she ever saw him again?<br><br>After a week or so more of being pushed out of her own bed and being sent back to her own room, Julia decided that she didn’t want to play games anymore. She couldn’t enjoy them when she was so worried about what might happen to her. She asked her mother if she would let her sleep in their bed again, and to her surprise, her mother said yes, but that Julia would have to promise not to mention the man in the car or go into the forest. Julia agreed to those terms, but she was troubled by her mother’s insistence that she not mention the man in the car or go into the forest. What was so bad about the man in the car? What was so bad about going into the forest?<br><br>That night, Julia and her mother went to bed and fell asleep quickly. Julia again slept soundly until she woke up in the middle of the night. She had a bad dream. She felt that something was wrong, but she didn’t have time to think about what it was before she was jolted out of her sleep by her mother’s screams. She quickly sat up in bed and listened, wondering what had awakened her mother so suddenly. To her horror, she heard her mother scream, “That’s him! That’s the man from the car! Everyone run!”<br><br>Julia got out of bed just as her mother screamed again, “He’s in the forest! Get out of there! He’s in the forest!”<br><br>Julia ran out of her bedroom and down to her mother’s room where she saw that her mother was standing in the middle of the room, pointing a gun at something outside of the window. She followed her mother’s gaze and saw a man standing outside of their bedroom window. He was smiling, and he looked very much like her father.<br><br>“Mom! Mom! What are you doing? Don’t shoot him!”<br><br>Her mother didn’t say anything. She just stood there, pointing the gun at the man. As Julia looked at her mother, she noticed that her mother didn’t look like herself. She looked angry and frightened, and she didn’t look like someone who would normally have a gun in her hand.<br><br>The man smiled and looked at Julia. He pointed at her mother and then at Julia. He said, “You better run, little girl. I wouldn’t want to hurt you.”<br><br>At that moment, Julia noticed that the man had one eye. She looked closer at his face and saw that he didn’t have a nose or a mouth. He was smiling, but his teeth and gums were completely absent. Julia started to cry, but she tried not to make any sound because she didn’t want her mother to shoot him.<br><br>Julia ran to her room and picked up her backpack. She put on a sweater and some shoes and then left the house. She didn’t know where to go, so she just followed the path through the forest that she and her father had once taken.

She was lost in the forest in the middle of the night with only a sweater and some shoes on her back.<br><br>She sat down on a fallen tree branch and started to cry softly. She wasn’t sure how long she had been lost, but her legs were very tired, and her shins were bleeding from the scrapes that they had gotten from running through the forest. She hoped that she would be able to find her way back to her house before she bled to death in the forest.<br><br>Julia stayed still for a while, thinking about her mother and her father. She wondered what had happened to them, and she hoped that they would be all right. She knew that her mother was going through some very difficult times, but she never would have thought that her mother would try to shoot her father.<br><br>After a while, Julia started to feel uncomfortable because of the way that she was sitting. She carefully stood up and started to walk through the forest again. She walked for a long time, but she still didn’t know where she was. She didn’t know how far she was from her house, and she didn’t know which direction to go in order to get back home. She decided that she had better find a tree that was large enough for her to climb in order to get a better view of the forest. She started to climb up the tree and looked around.<br><br>She saw that the sun was starting to rise in the east, and she realized that she was going to have to stay in the forest in order to survive.

The gym was empty for the first few weeks but as soon as New Years came around all of a sudden there was a line of people waiting to get in.

Shannon and Brad Barton's marriage is on the rocks due to Brad's infidelity.,"She was gone. It was the thought that kept repeating itself over and over again in Brad Barton’s mind. He was walking back to his car one evening after a long day at the office when he got the news that his wife, Shannon, had committed suicide.<br><br>    His world fell apart when he heard that. Shannon was the only good thing in his life – his life was consumed by work and he didn’t have time for a personal life because of it.<br><br>    Brad had been married to her for twenty years – they had always been a happy couple, and he had never thought she would do something like this to their family.  Shannon struggled with depression from time to time, so it wasn’t totally unexpected, but Brad didn’t think that it would have been something that she would act upon.<br><br>    She was his wife, best friend, confidant – he loved her and now she was gone.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br> Brad was able to get a couple of weeks off from work since the company he worked for was very understanding with these types of things. He hadn’t been home in a while when he arrived, so he had to take care of some things.<br><br>    He went into the bedroom where Shannon used to sleep and saw that she hadn’t made the bed yet. It was just as she had left it – unmade and a half-empty glass of water beside her pillow.<br><br>    Brad couldn’t look at anything, so he went into the bathroom and turned on the shower. He started to undress when he felt someone watching him.<br><br>    “Shannon? Is that you?” Brad asked in a questioning tone as he looked behind him expecting to see her.<br><br>    Brad had been doing this a lot lately – expecting to see her around every corner.<br><br>    There was no reply, so he went to the shower and turned the water on. He looked into the mirror and was surprised to see Shannon’s reflection looking back at him.<br><br>    “You look just like me now,” Shannon said with a smile.<br><br>    “I know,” Brad replied. “It’s kind of scary.”<br><br>    Shannon turned towards Brad and said, “You have to leave – you have a family that needs you now.”<br><br>    Brad turned the water off and stepped out of the shower. He grabbed a towel and dried himself off, then he went to the bedroom and threw on a T-shirt and sweatpants. He was walking towards the hall when he felt someone grab his elbow.<br><br>    “I’m sorry about what I did,” Brad said.<br><br>    “None of that matters now,” Shannon said. “You have to let me go. I need to be with your father now.”<br><br>    “I don’t understand what you mean,” Brad replied as tears welled up in his eyes.<br><br>    “You will,” Shannon said. “I promise you will.” She stopped talking and then was gone. Brad just stood in the hall where he saw her for the last time. He started to cry and collapsed onto the floor in tears.<br><br>Brad fell asleep on the floor and didn’t wake up until he heard his daughter screaming at him from her bedroom. “Mommy, Mommy, I miss you so much.”<br><br>    “I miss you too, Emily,” Brad said as he picked his daughter up and gave her a hug.<br><br>    “It’s not the same. I miss Mommy too,” Emily sobbed as she buried her face into her father’s chest.<br><br>    Brad held Emily for what had to have been an hour. He stood up and checked on his son, Nathan, who was still asleep in his bed. Brad knew that he wasn’t going to get any more sleep that night.<br><br>Chapter 3<br><br> Brad stared at the computer screen feeling the need to fill up some of the empty space in front of him. He didn’t know what he was going to do with all of his free time now that Shannon was gone. He thought about going to the gym; however, he wasn’t sure if he would have enough energy.<br><br>    He opened up a blank document and started typing. “I miss you, my dear. Your death has affected my life in ways I could have never imagined,” Brad said as his left hand started to type faster.<br><br>    “It’s been two months now; however, it feels like yesterday that you were taken from me. I don’t know how long it will take before I can let go.” He closed the document and started typing in another one, “The hardest thing I have ever had to do is tell my children that you are gone. How do you explain to a six year old and a two year old that their mother is gone forever?” Brad stopped typing again and stared at the screen for a moment, then continued, “I also have to come to terms with the fact that I caused your death.” Brad closed the document and started typing in a new one. “I hope that somewhere in this great big universe of ours there is a force that will bring you back to me.” Brad hit the caps lock key and then tapped the enter key on his keyboard. He stared at what he had written for a few minutes. He was surprised to see that it wasn’t like the other document he had written.<br><br>    It was more like a letter, Brad thought. He left the document open and walked out of his office and into the living room where his children were watching cartoons. He sat down on the couch as they continued to watch, then he tapped the computer screen, indicating",1
Anna Cooper begins her job as a janitor at a school and quickly realizes that something is very wrong.,"Anna sighed with relief as she hung up her work clothes. She had spent the entire day cleaning up the hallways and bathrooms at St. John’s Elementary School, but it was finally done. It was going to be one hell of a week, but at least she had her favorite shows to look forward to. She decided that she would finish some household chores before she would settle down for the night. Anna picked up her long-handled mop and bucket and began to scrub the kitchen floor. As she was moving from one side of the kitchen to the other, wiping up dirt and grime, her cell phone began to ring. It was a number she did not recognize, but Anna decided to answer it anyway. She hoped that speaking with someone might help ease the boredom that had been plaguing her for the past few hours.<br><br>	“Hello?” Anna asked when she picked up.<br><br>	“Hey, honey, it’s me,” said a female voice on the other end of the line.<br><br>	Anna recognized the voice immediately; it belonged to her mother, who was supposed to be at work.<br><br>	“Mom? Shouldn’t you be at work right now?”<br><br>	“No, honey, I took the day off, remember? You and your father had a fight last night. I figured you could use a little bit of company.”<br><br>	“Oh right,” Anna remembered. “I completely forgot about that.”<br><br>	“How are you doing?” asked Anna’s mother.<br><br>	“I’m okay. I guess,” said Anna, her tone indicating that she was not very happy with the conversation. “How are you doing?”<br><br>	“Oh, I’m fine, honey. I just wanted to make sure that you’re doing okay. Oh, and your father called me a few minutes ago. He says he’s sorry for whatever happened last night, and he wants to make sure that you are okay. He also said that he would call you later.”<br><br>	Anna rolled her eyes. “Mmm, that’s nice, Mom. Of course he said that, but I’m not sure how much I believe him.”<br><br>	“Well, maybe you should trust your father. You know how much he cares about you. I know he’s your father, but maybe you shouldn’t take it out on him so much.”<br><br>	“Yeah, I guess you’re right, Mom. I don’t know why I do that to him. It’s just that he seems to always have to have the last word, and then he makes me feel like shit. I can never tell him anything about my feelings. He just gets angry and says that I’m being stupid. It’s just frustrating.”<br><br>	“I understand, honey, trust me, I do, but you’re going to have to learn to work with him. You are both adults now, and there are things that both of you need to deal with. I don’t want you to get married and then have these same problems all over again. Sometimes it’s hard for me to be married, but your father and I love each other very much. We’re still working on a way to make it work, but sometimes I just can’t stand being married to him. We’re both very stubborn, and that doesn’t help matters any.”<br><br>	“I know, Mom. I just don’t know how to deal with him sometimes. I always try to avoid telling him things and then just bottle everything up. I know that’s not healthy, but I don’t know what to do about it.”<br><br>	“I understand, honey, and I know you probably don’t want to hear it, but I have to say it anyway. You really need to learn how to express yourself and deal with your dad. I know he’s stubborn, but so are you, and if you guys aren’t able to talk about your feelings, that isn’t going to help anything. You need to learn how to open up to him. It will be hard, but I know that you can do it. Your father loves you very much, and he just wants what is best for you. Sometimes he doesn’t know how to act. He shouldn’t have said some of the things that he did last night, but it is important that you understand where he’s coming from.”<br><br>	“Mmm, yeah, I know you’re right, Mom. You always are. I guess I’m just not ready to deal with him yet. Maybe one day, but I don’t think that will happen anytime soon.”<br><br>	“Well, that’s okay, but you do need to remember that if you want your relationship with him to improve, you have to work at it. You can’t just keep avoiding it forever. When you get married, I don’t want you guys to be fighting all the time. You know how important your marriage is to me, and I don’t want you to ruin it by not talking about things. You have to learn how to open up, and it’s okay for you to be angry, but you have to learn how to deal with it. Sometimes the best way to deal with it isn’t to keep everything bottled up.”<br><br>	Anna was silent for a moment, as she was thinking about what her mother had just said. She knew that she was running away from her problems, but she didn’t know what to do. She loved her mother very much, and she knew that everything that she said was always for the best. She knew that she should trust her mother, but",1
Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"<br><br>Gabriel had a gas oven with two burners, so he could only bake one item at a time. He had to make sure that he left enough space between each item to be able to open the oven door and remove the finished dish without having to move any other dishes. He needed a lot of freezer space because he could only store a few items in his refrigerator at a time.<br><br>Gabriel had lived on his own before, so he knew how to cook simple meals. But now, Gabriel was living on his own for the first time, and he was learning how to cook more fancy dishes. He moved into his tiny apartment with a small kitchen, so he had to learn to get creative.<br><br>Gabriel was originally from a small town in Colorado, where there were many scenic hiking trails and biking routes. However, Gabriel was in the city now, where there were not many hiking or biking trails nearby. Gabriel liked going to the local park and jogging on the paved trails. Gabriel lived close to the beach, where he enjoyed hanging out at the boardwalk with his friends. Gabriel was doing all of these things to keep himself busy and stay active while he looked for a job.<br><br>Gabriel had a big social circle, since he attended college in a large city, where he met many people from all over the world. Gabriel stayed in touch with these people, and it was nice to have a support network of friends when moving to a new city. Gabriel had some family members who lived nearby. Gabriel moved closer to them so that they could take care of him if he ever needed anything.<br><br>Gabriel started looking for a job right away, but he had no luck at first. Gabriel was unsure what kind of job to be looking for because he did not have enough experience in any one field yet.  There was a period of time when Gabriel could not find a job. Gabriel did not like living off of his savings, but he had to use them until he could find a job. Gabriel’s parents wanted him to stay on their health insurance plan back home, since it was cheaper. Gabriel still paid rent and bills in the city where he lived. Gabriel did not want to fall behind in paying his bills.<br><br>Once Gabriel found a job, he earned enough money to pay his expenses easily without having to rely on his savings. Gabriel made enough money to visit the local bars and clubs with his friends, but he did not  go out as much as they did. Gabriel had a girlfriend now, and he wanted to spend more time with her instead of his other friends.<br><br>Gabriel started dating Lina Sanchez. He met her at one of the places where he had gone out with his friends in the past few weeks. Lina Sanchez was Gabriel’s friend’s ex-girlfriend, but she became his girlfriend after a while.<br><br>Lina Sanchez was Gabriel’s first girlfriend from a different culture. She was from Italy, and she studied creative writing at a local university in Denver. She came to America when she was nineteen years old. Gabriel met her when he was twenty years old.<br><br>Gabriel met her at a bar where Lina Sanchez used to go with her family. Her parents owned the restaurant, and they were there most of the time. They spoke Italian and English with their customers when they ate there. Gabriel met Lina Sanchez while he was out with his friends drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.<br><br>Gabriel met her because she was a beautiful girl. She had dark brown eyes, brunette hair, and olive skin. She had a slender body and long black hair that reached down to her waistline.  She always wore fashionable clothes, and she looked like a Hollywood actress.<br><br>They started to get closer after a few weeks. Gabriel walked her home one night, and they kissed each other in front of the restaurant while Lina Sanchez’s parents were watching. They did not do anything else that night, but they started to date after that. They went on many dates, and Gabriel met her parents after a few months.<br><br>Gabriel felt like he was dating an older woman from the beginning of their relationship because she was nineteen years old when they met, and Gabriel was only twenty years old when they started dating.  He thought that he acted more mature than she did, and he considered himself to be a more grown-up person than she was.<br><br>After almost two years together, they moved in together into a little apartment. They were officially boyfriend and girlfriend, but they still acted as if they were children living at home with their parents. When they moved into the apartment, Gabriel had a lot of stuff that he brought from his parents’ house. He also had some books and other items that he bought for his apartment. He had to rearrange all of them because there was not much space in the small room.<br><br>They went out many times during the next couple of weeks, and Gabriel’s friends were visiting the apartment often to meet his girlfriend. They started to talk about relationship problems when they were bored, so for a couple of hours Gabriel and Lina talked about their relationship issues. They seemed to work through some of them when they moved in together.<br><br>Gabriel felt that he needed to be more mature, and he thought that he was not ready for this kind of responsibility after only two years together with her. He was worried that they were growing apart, but he did not know how to express these feelings to her. <br><br>He did not feel like a grown-up yet. He continued to ask his parents for money now and then, even though he was twenty years old and had a steady job. He would not stop talking about his parents when they visited the apartment, even though he lived there for almost two months already. Gabriel felt that he was still a teenager, but his behavior did not help him feel like an independent man in a relationship with a young woman.<br><br>Gabriel started to feel that he was in love with Lina because she seemed to be the best thing that happened to him lately. She was better than his new apartment, and better than his new job, but Gabriel started to feel that this was not enough for a happy relationship. He wanted more; he wanted to feel responsible and independent.<br><br>Gabriel decided that he was going to talk about this issue with her. He felt guilty and afraid at the same time; it was not easy to face the idea that they might not be on the same page anymore.",1

Jack was holding a beer bottle in his hands, and Eliza was stirring a pot of spaghetti sauce on the stove.<br><br>	“Honey, do you want me to stir the sauce? It looks like you’re getting pretty good at it,” she said.<br><br>	“No, babe. You’re doing a great job,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how it looks. I just love watching you do it, that’s all. It makes me happy to see you happy.”<br><br>	Jack finished the beer, and he threw it into the trashcan in the corner of the kitchen. It landed perfectly into the trashcan, and he smiled.<br><br>	“That was perfect!” he yelled. “I just love watching you do that, too! I wish I could do it every time!”<br><br>	Jack grabbed a plate off the counter, and some silverware. He walked over to the table and put the plate in front of him. Then he grabbed his beer bottle and sat down at the table, right next to Eliza. He was always so happy when they were together. He never wanted to leave her side. It was almost like he knew that something bad would happen if he ever did.<br><br>	“I love you so much, Eliza.

They were sitting back in their rocking chairs, listening to the sounds of nature and sipping their coffee.<br><br>	Then, all of a sudden, they heard a loud crash in the distance. The sound of breaking glass echoed through the air, as if it had come from right next to them. The front window of their house shattered, and the door flew open. A young man ran into their house and started shooting at them with a gun. They fell to the ground, dead. In the distance, an ambulance could be heard.<br><br> Write a story based on the premise above, using the current outline, or one of your own design.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br> Jacky was walking through the woods, a big smile on his face.

He looked up at the sky, and smiled when he saw that there were a few clouds that looked like sheep floating in the sky. Then, all of a sudden, he heard a noise behind him.<br><br>	He turned around to see where it came from, but then he saw a strange figure standing in front of him. It was about seven feet tall, with three arms and three legs. Its face was just like that of a man. However, its eyes were completely black, and it had no nose. The creature spoke to him in a deep voice.<br><br>	“I have been waiting for you for a very long time, Jacky,” it said to him.<br><br>	“What do you mean?” Jacky asked. “What are you?”<br><br>	The creature pointed to itself. “A monster,",0
Aimee Kincaid goes home after a long day at work only to find her apartment empty and her loneliness amplified by the silence.,"Aimee Kincaid came home to an empty apartment. She found the silence deafening. She felt alone, even though she had spent the day around people, listening to them talk and laugh and complain. She knew how it sounded when a person sat in solitude after a long trip. She would return from a long journey and sit on her bed and watch the light through the blinds or listen to her neighbor’s conversations with his wife on their balcony.<br><br>But she had never been home alone like this. Maybe that was why she felt so strange. So different, out of place. The solitude was new to her.<br><br>She went into the bathroom and turned on the shower and then, without really knowing why she wanted to, she moved through the apartment turning on all the lights. She turned them on in the kitchen, in her bedroom, even in the closet where nothing but old clothes were kept neatly folded. She  lit candles strategically placed around the room so that shadows could not obscure her vision or movement. She sat on her couch and listened to the silence, stared at the flickering lights, waiting for them to hypnotize her into a dreamy state of mind.<br><br>She was very tired but could not sleep. She stood up and found her way to the bedroom where she stripped off her clothes, put on a nightgown, and climbed into bed. She turned off all the lights except for the bedside lamp and lay there listening to the ticking of the wall clock and to the faint drone of cars passing on the street below. Silence was the only sound in the apartment now, and it was completely deafening.<br><br>Aimee felt a sudden sense of panic and fear. She had the feeling that someone was watching her, that someone or something was waiting for her to be completely vulnerable before striking out at her. She found herself looking around her apartment, trying to see something or someone who could be causing this feeling. But she found nothing there, only the light from the lamp moving gently against her walls and ceiling. Silence was all around her, and it seemed so absolute that she felt as if she were being smothered by its weight. Silence was all-encompassing. In her apartment.<br><br>Silence was all-encompassing in her own small corner of the world, and it was suffocating to her. Silence pressed in on her from all sides, making it hard for her to breathe, and she felt suddenly overwhelmed by it.  She started to cry.<br><br>She cried because the silence was terrifying. She cried because it was so loud, so overwhelming. She cried because she felt alone in a way that no one should have to feel alone, her own small safe island surrounded by an ocean of noise and voices that had suddenly turned into nothing more than a silent and lonely roaring emptiness.<br><br>She felt exhausted and drained, drained of all the energy it took to simply get through her day. She felt lonely, unable to see past the walls that surrounded her, unable to even reach out for something solid with which she could hold on. She felt defeated by the  silence around her because she knew that it would never be silent again, at least not for a very long time.<br><br>She cried because there was no one in her apartment, there was no where else to go, there was nothing else to do but cry and wonder why the hell she had ever come back in the first place. She cried because she suddenly felt so alone, more alone than even being at work with all those people who were unable to see past her mask, and all she wanted was to be surrounded by voices and noise.<br><br>She kept crying as she washed her face and brushed her teeth, crying because there was",1
"Kitty then turns her attention to the cats in the park, and eventually discovers that Sergei Snipe, a Russian Blue cat, is behind the murders.",".<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky looked at the picture again and said, “I don’t understand the point of this.”<br><br>	“It’s pretty easy to understand,” said the Mayor. “The killer is a cat, just like you. And he hates dogs because they kill his people. In the morning, when you go to the dog park, he wants you to feel as though you are losing part of your family.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “That doesn’t make any sense. I have nothing to do with this killer. I have never even seen him before.”<br><br>	The Mayor sat back in his chair and said, “That’s because he has been coming to the park at night when you aren’t there. He is trying to incite a war between dogs and cats.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky looked at the Mayor and said, “I have never seen this man before, how do you know he’s a cat?”<br><br>	The Mayor picked up another picture off of his desk and said, “You probably haven’t seen him before because he has been watching you for several weeks.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky looked at the picture of the man and said, “What is this?”<br><br>	“That is a picture of him,” said the Mayor. “He was the one who planted the catnip in your house.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky narrowed his eyes and said, “So, you think I have been corrupted by this man? I am offended that you would think me so weak.”<br><br>	The Mayor stood up from his chair and said, “Kitty, I didn’t mean to imply that. I was simply stating a fact that he has been corrupting you.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “He has been corrupting my family?”<br><br>	“Yes,” said the Mayor.<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky stood up from his chair and walked around the desk. He picked up a picture off of the Mayor’s desk and handed it to him.<br><br>	“Who is this?” asked the Mayor.<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “It’s me.”<br><br>	The Mayor looked at the picture and said, “You?”<br><br>	Kitty nodded his head and said, “I looked at this picture before I went to bed last night. This is what you are looking at right now.”<br><br>	The Mayor nodded his head and said, “So you are telling me I am looking at you in the flesh?”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky nodded his head and said, “Yes. Look at my left ear.  You can see the little earring I have.”<br><br>	The Mayor looked at the picture and then back at Kitty Pawsky. He said, “Kitty, you don’t have an earring.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “No. It’s not an earring, it’s a little piece of string I found when I was looking for food. It may have been a piece of dental floss.”<br><br>	The Mayor shook his head and said, “Kitty… I appreciate your honesty… but you have been corrupted by this man. I am going to have to suspend you if you continue to associate with him.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “Mayor, I don’t know where he is. If I could tell you where he is…”<br><br>	The Mayor jumped up from his chair and said, “Well, let me call a detective to help you find him.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky shook his head and said, “Mayor, I know where he is. He’s at my house.”<br><br>	The Mayor sat back down in his chair and said, “You know where he is?”<br><br>	Kitty nodded his head and said, “Yes, he’s at my house. He… well… he was a good friend of mine.”<br><br>	The Mayor shook his head and said, “You mean before he planted drugs in your house and caused a murder?”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky said, “Well… yes. I guess so. He was a good friend of mine before that.”<br><br>	The Mayor got up from his chair and said, “How do I know that you won’t kill me if I let you go home?”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky laughed and said, “I can’t tell you that.”<br><br>	The Mayor sat back down in his chair and said, “That’s what I thought. You’re off the force. Good bye, Kitty.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky nodded his head and said, “Mayor, I think you should reconsider my suspension. I know where he is and I can get him to turn himself in.”<br><br>	The Mayor shook his head and said, “I don’t trust you.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky stood up from his chair and said, “Mayor, I would never kill anybody. He may have planted drugs in my house, but I wouldn’t kill anybody.”<br><br>	The Mayor nodded his head and said, “Look, I can’t call this meeting of the Town Council back together again if you do this.”<br><br>	Kitty Pawsky sighed and said, “Well, that’s true. Okay. I will let",0
The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"just been there for a few weeks now and it just won’t go away.”<br><br>	I looked at her, concerned, and nodded my head. “Well, when you go next week for the tests, maybe your doctor can give you something to keep your mind off of it until you get the results back,” I replied. “If it’s cancer, that will be the time to worry about it, not before.”<br><br>	She looked at me and nodded her head. “You’re probably right, Nick,” she replied. “I just don’t want to think about it at all right now.”<br><br>	She took a deep breath and looked at me. I watched as she wiped a few more tears from her eyes. “Nick, I really have to tell someone about this,” she said as she shook her head.<br><br>	“Okay,” I replied as I took a seat next to her on the bed. “Who do you want to tell?”<br><br>	She stared at me and lifted her shoulders up a few times. “I don’t know, Nick,” she replied. “I just feel like I have to tell someone.”<br><br>	I sighed and shook my head. “Melissa, I wish that there was something I could do to help you, but there really isn’t anything that I can think of,” I replied.<br><br>	“Well, for starters, you could just listen to me vent for a while,” she suggested. “Maybe that will help. Talk about something else and I’ll feel better.”<br><br>	I nodded my head and thought about it for a moment. “Okay,” I replied, and then she started telling me about her day at the hospital and how she got sick of answering the same questions over and over again.<br><br>	I listened to her for a while without saying anything. She told me about a conversation she had with an older woman whose daughter was diagnosed with cancer a few months prior. Melissa listened as the woman told her how lucky she was to have so many people around her who would do anything for her. The woman went on and on about how much her daughter loved the hospital staff and how they were the first family she had around her in a long time. She told Melissa that even if it wasn’t for her cancer, she would still love spending time with them. Melissa started to tear up at the end of the woman’s story and she looked at me.<br><br>	“I’m sorry I brought this all up to you, Nick,” she said. “I just felt like I needed to tell someone about it.”<br><br>	I shook my head and smiled. “Don’t worry about it, Melissa,” I replied. “I am always here for you. If you need me, you can always call me and I will come over right away.”<br><br>	I looked at her and she stared at me. “Do you want to talk about something else?” I asked.<br><br>	She stared at me and nodded her head. “Yeah,” she replied, smiling. “How about we talk about your day instead?”<br><br>	I smiled back at her and thought about how much I missed her when she was away at college. “Well, it was pretty quiet for the most part today,” I replied. “I got to sleep in a little bit and I went down to the diner for breakfast. George wasn’t even mad about me being late.”<br><br>	Melissa looked at me and smiled. “Of course not,” she replied. “You’re never late, Nick.”<br><br>	I looked at her and stared at her for a second. “What do you mean I’m never late?” I asked as I looked at her.<br><br>	She smiled at me and shook her head. “You never are, Nick. You are always on time to everything.”<br><br>	She did that little smirk thing with her lips and I started to giggle. “Well, what else is there to do around here?” I asked.<br><br>	She stared at me and shook her head slightly. “Okay, okay,” she replied as she smiled back at me. “We may live in the middle of nowhere, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t anything to do around here. We have a movie theater and a mall.”<br><br>	I stared at her and thought about it for a moment. “A mall?” I asked as I looked at her. “Where?”<br><br>	She looked at me and smiled. “In the next town over,” she replied. “Actually, it’s in the next state over. It is about twenty minutes away by car and it has everything you could possibly want. There is even a food court with six different restaurants.”<br><br>	I thought about it for a minute as she stared at me and then I started laughing. “Are you joking?” I asked.<br><br>	She looked at me and frowned. “No,” she replied. “What? There isn’t a mall here?”<br><br>	I shook my head as I smiled at her. “There are two gas stations and a few small stores,” I replied as I thought about the places she was talking about.<br><br>	She smiled at me and looked so cute. “I guess you are right,” she said as she laughed a little bit. “But, we don’t need a mall here anyway. We have all the basics covered and that is all we need.”<br><br>	I shook my head at her as I smiled. She was such a sweet woman and it was so easy to fall in",0
Shannon starts painting as a way to connect with her mother and finds comfort in the creative process.,"friends, and she had stopped taking part in the activities she used to enjoy doing in her spare time. Shannon was spending more time alone at home because her father didn’t seem interested in doing anything with her, and so it seemed as though she had no one else to turn to but herself. “She’s trying to cope with her loss, and I don’t think she’s learned to do that yet,” Uncle Jeff said.<br><br>Shannon was sitting on the edge of her bed, holding a box of oil paints that was given to her by her mother before she passed away from cancer. She started crying uncontrollably once again upon seeing both her uncle and father approach her room slowly. “What are you doing here?” Shannon asked, wiping the tears from her face and standing up. There were paint stains on her cheeks, nose and hands. Her uncle could see that she had been crying for a while.<br><br>“I came to talk to you,” her father said.<br><br>“About what?” Shannon asked, turning away from them. She started pacing around the room as she spoke. “You don’t care how I feel, so why should I tell you?” she asked.<br><br>Her father stepped inside the room and placed a hand on her shoulder. “I do care about how you feel daughter,” he said softly. Her uncle noticed that there were small tears forming in her father’s eyes.<br><br>“Yeah, right. If you did care, you wouldn’t have left us all behind to deal with this grief on our own,” she said, turning to face her father directly now. She looked in his eyes and saw that he had started crying now. “He doesn’t care.” She turned to face her uncle now. “You don’t care either, do you?”<br><br>Her uncle sighed and shook his head slowly. He did care, but he knew that she wouldn’t believe him just yet. “No, I do care Shannon,” he said gently.<br><br>She looked at him for a few moments while the tears continued to fall from her father’s eyes and then nodded and walked over to sit on her bed. The two men stood nearby, unsure of what to do next. Her father was crying now,  so he didn’t know how to handle this situation.<br><br>Shannon saw the box of oil paints on her nightstand. She picked it up and opened it slowly, letting the tears continue to stream down her face as she did so. She stared at the empty canvas in front of her for a few moments before she took out a large brush and dipped it into a small jar of red paint. Then, Shannon started to paint.<br><br>She started painting out of her own grief and loneliness, but as she worked, she found that somehow painting helped to ease it. She painted for hours and didn’t eat anything. Shannon’s need to paint became so strong that she decided to clear out her attic and turn it into a studio, so that she could paint there whenever she felt like it.<br><br>She turned her old wooden desk into a workbench and filled the walls with canvases, paints, brushes, and other painting materials. Shannon moved her easel to the center of the room and placed two chairs in front of it. She hung some potted plants in the corners of the room for decoration purposes. The attic was small, but she didn’t mind that. It was just right for her. It also reminded  her of the attic in the family’s old barn.<br><br>Shannon would spend hours in the studio, painting and listening to music on her headphones. She discovered that drawing people helped her to feel connected with her mother once more, and so she would draw portraits of her mother over and over again. The  act of drawing also helped Shannon to cope with her feelings.<br><br>Shannon started to put her own feelings into the paintings, too. She could often be found staring at one of her own unfinished paintings, which had two figures standing in a meadow. The figures were very dark and pale, reflecting Shannon’s feelings of being filled with darkness but also feeling a glimmer of light at the same time.<br><br>This painting became an outlet for Shannon and she would often sit and stare at it for long periods of time to try to work some of her pain and confusion out on it. Sometimes, she would cover the painted surface with salt and trace the outlines of her paintings in a faint blue wash. This felt like she was connecting with someone, especially since her own mother could no longer speak to her. Shannon felt as if she were having a conversation with her mother by painting the images over and over again. Shannon started to feel closer to her paintings and knew that they helped her to heal.<br><br>Shannon painted for hours every day, with only a short break for lunch which she always ate while standing up. She drank a lot of water so that she wouldn’t feel weak or tired. She felt almost as peaceful as when she was painting and felt that it was her therapy. Shannon painted every night until she finished a painting, and then she would start a new one. Sometimes, she would paint for six hours straight without stopping, and this helped to ease the pain in her heart. Sometimes, while painting, Shannon felt like",1
Shannon's paintings help her to deal with her grief and to find a new sense of purpose.,"<br><br>Shannon finished wiping away her tears and looked at the canvases on the floor. “I think I really will appreciate them more now, but I don’t know what to do next. Should I put them away or hang them on the wall first?”<br><br>Rosemary thought for a minute. “You can put them in your studio later on. Besides the attic room was getting crowded and now you have a whole other place to work! You can put them up there when you get ready to move each canvas. Right now, I think we should try and get the attic finished first.”<br><br>Shannon looked at the unfinished attic with some sadness. “I know you are right about the attic being too small and I am excited about my new studio, but I will miss working in my old attic. It is where I used to paint all the time with my mom. The attic always held so many memories for me and now that she is gone, I can’t bring myself to clean it out. I have left everything just the way it was.” Shannon moved around in the attic and picked up a few of her mother’s paintings. She put them back down before moving on.<br><br>Shannon’s heart was filled with sadness as she moved down the attic stairs. She had finished cleaning out the room and had started moving the furniture to the studio earlier that day. She had moved her easel and paints, but still hadn’t decided on what  to do about all of her mother’s paintings. The attic was the last room in the house that needed to be cleaned out and Shannon knew she would have to go up there soon no matter how hard it was.<br><br>Shannon put her head in her hands, overwhelmed with sadness and grief. She sat down on the bottom step of the stairs and started crying. “I just wish I had more time with you mom! You were so amazing and I miss you so much!” Shannon covered her face with her hands hoping she wouldn’t cry as hard if she couldn’t see her tears.<br><br>A few minutes later, Shannon heard a soft knock on the door. She quickly wiped her tears and stood up slowly. She opened the door to see her dad standing outside with several large boxes of pizza in his hands.<br><br>“Hey Shan, how are you doing?” He stepped into the room and set the pizza boxes down.<br><br>Shannon wrapped her arms around him and started crying again. “I miss her so much! I can’t believe she is gone!”<br><br>“I know it is hard honey. It gets easier every day, but it also makes a little harder because you miss her so much.” He patted Shannon on the back and looked over her shoulder to see that the floor was already cleared out and she was in the middle of painting.<br><br>“Hey sis!” came a cheerful voice from behind Shannon and she was greeted by the smiling face of her older sister Sara. She walked into the room and brought with her a comforting scent of lavender. “How are you holding up?”<br><br>“I am okay, just missing her so much! I still can’t believe she is gone!” Shannon  cried.<br><br>“It’s okay, we miss her too. But it is going to get better every day, and you will gradually learn to cope with it. You just need something to focus on, something positive that will make you happy. I think painting would be a great way to keep your mind busy, and do something productive to keep your mind off of her. I love seeing what you do Shannon! It brings back so many good memories from when we were kids,” Sara smiled. “You really have a talent there honey, don’t ever forget that!” Shannon felt a ray of hope from her sister’s words and it lifted her spirits. She was determined to prove that she was just as good an artist as her mother had been.<br><br>Shannon felt motivated by the praise. She felt a sense of determination to get better, and try to create more sophisticated paintings. Shannon looked at the brushes that she had gotten from her father’s art supplies, and noticed how much better they were than hers. They were expensive art brushes that had the best quality paint on them. They were much finer than the ones she had been using for her projects, and allowed for more intricate  details.<br><br>Shannon set up a small table in her space in the attic, and started to prepare her palette for a new painting. She felt comfortable and at peace with herself out there, away from the world. The paint that came with the brushes was very high quality, and she was thrilled about experimenting with it. Shannon wanted to try and emulate the style of her mom’s paintings, even if she didn’t quite have the talent and skill yet. She wanted to do it just for her mom, because she knew that her mom would be so proud of her. Shannon hoped that by doing this, she could somehow feel closer to her mother again.<br><br>Shannon wanted to create more beautiful, bigger paintings like the one that hung in her bedroom. They had all of her favorite things about the city; pictures of cars and skyscrapers, as well as various people in different clothes walking around. It was as if Shannon’s mom had known that she would love the city, even though she had never been there herself.",1
Shannon's paintings begin to take on a life of their own and Shannon starts to feel like her paintings are her new family.,"the paintings were talking to her, and she responded back through them. When she felt close to someone, Shannon would often give her paintings as gifts and tell people that they were her family.<br><br>Shannon continued to paint and show her paintings around town, and people began to notice them. She was invited by various places to have an exhibit of her paintings, and she started to make a little money from selling them. This made her very proud.<br><br>Shannon’s uncle saw how much she enjoyed painting and helped to build a small studio in the attic of their house for her. She soon filled up the studio with paintings, and it became very crowded.<br><br>Katie Matthews was now a friend of Shannon’s, and she also painted. Katie didn’t think she was very good at painting but felt inspired by Shannon Daniels who encouraged her to draw and paint whenever she could. They often painted together when they were at each other’s houses.<br><br>Shannon continued her journey as an artist, and she entered a variety of exhibits. Her paintings became recognizable throughout the town, and people often stopped to look at them when they passed by.<br><br>Shannon’s paintings became popular enough that she was able to make a living from them. Her uncle helped her rent a small office in town where she sold her paintings.<br><br>She continued to enter art shows, and now even her painting teacher had heard of her and asked if she would show some of her paintings in an exhibit on campus for students who were interested in pursuing careers in the arts.<br><br>Katie Matthews entered the art show with Shannon Daniels, and they both displayed many of their paintings. They talked to each other about how much fun it was to see their works hanging on the walls at the art show.<br><br>One evening after all the exhibits were closed for the night, Shannon and Katie were looking at the gallery one last time. They were admiring their work when they noticed someone standing in the shadows staring at their paintings. Shannon and Katie quickly moved over to the entrance of the exhibit so that they could get a better look at who was standing there.<br><br>“Who are you?” asked Shannon.<br><br>The man stepped into the light and said, “I’m sorry. I just wanted to come by and see your paintings, but I didn’t mean to disturb you. Some of these paintings are really good, and the  one you have hanging up over there is especially beautiful.” The man pointed at Shannon’s favorite painting—a large red rose with green leaves and a red ribbon tied around it.<br><br>“Thank you for the compliment,” said Shannon. “Are you an artist?”<br><br>The man took a closer look at Shannon’s favorite painting, then he smiled. “You caught me. I’m Rosemary Jacobs, and I teach art at the high school here in town.”<br><br>Shannon felt compelled to tell Rosemary about her mother’s art class, and how much the painting meant to her. “I think my mom painted this, but she passed away a couple of years ago from cancer. It was the last thing she gave me before she died and it means so much to me.”<br><br>A look of compassion and concern washed over Rosemary’s face. “I’m sorry Shannon; I didn’t mean to bring up painful memories. I just wanted to say that you have beautiful talent, and I think your paintings are amazing. You should show these at the art festival next month.”<br><br>Shannon was moved by Rosemary’s kindness, and she really enjoyed talking to her. “Thank you, again, Rosemary. I’ll think about it. I appreciate all the compliments on my art work, but I haven’t shown anyone else what I’ve painted. This is my first painting class. My mom gave me some paints years ago, but I never really used them. She said they were hers when she was younger and she thought that I might enjoy them. So, I decided to pick up a brush and try it out for myself,” Shannon finished.<br><br>“I think you should share what you have created with others. I think it would be so great if you could enter your artwork into the art festival next month, “Rosemary said enthusiastically.<br><br>“I think I could do that, Rosemary. But I’m moving soon to a new house with my dad and Uncle John, and I really couldn’t paint in my new house. My old studio is in my attic, and it is pretty cramped up there. It would be such a mess if I tried to paint there. My dad suggested I contact  someone who had an office for rent. So, I rented the one you found for me, and now I can paint there.”<br><br>“That is wonderful! You are so talented and creative. What you create is beautiful, Shannon! You could have a really successful art career.” Rosemary was very excited about Shannon’s future career as an artist.<br><br>Shannon smiled, “I doubt that, Rosemary. But if it happens, that would really be great! I think Katie should enter her artwork into the exhibit too. We both would enjoy it so much, and I think our paintings would look nice hanging next to each other.”<br><br>Rosemary smiled, “I agree that would be a wonderful idea. Let’s call up Katie and ask her to enter the show.”<br><br>Shannon had forgotten all about the conversation with Uncle Jeff about entering her artwork into the art festival, which Shannon and Rosemary had planned to do that afternoon.<br><br>Rosemary hung up the phone and said, “Shannon, I have some exciting news. I just called over to talk to your Uncle Jeff and he said that you can submit your artwork for the art gallery show at college. Shannon, that is so exciting!”<br><br>Shannon was excited too. The prospect of having her artwork in a show was thrilling to her. “Wow, I am so glad you told me about it, Rosemary! Now I know what to do with all those pictures I have in my attic. Shannon’s attic was full of boxes filled with canvases. There were large canvases stacked on top of smaller canvases that were stacked on top of more boxes. There were paintings of all shapes and sizes in the boxes. Some were framed and others were not, but all of them had the same signature in the bottom corner. Shannon thought she recognized the signature. She thought it was her mother’s.<br><br>Shannon moved a box out from in front of her, so she could see better. The signature said: Shannon Daniels and below that was written: 1996-2009. Shannon wiped away tears and smiled. “I can’t believe my mom painted these pictures of me! They must have been painted when I was three years old, because I remember that is when my mom said I got paint on my dress and then on my hair too. I wonder why she never showed them  to me when I was a little girl?”<br><br>Rosemary looked at the canvases with Shannon. “I don’t know why she never showed you these paintings when you were smaller, but maybe now that you are older, you will be able to appreciate them more.”",1
Mary Smith walks home from work and becomes the victim of a mugging attempt by John Doe.,"The alley was dark. It was a short walk from the corner where Mary Smith had been walking, but she still didn’t trust it. Mary fidgeted the whole way, watching all around her for anyone who might be lurking in the shadows. She didn’t like this alley; it was dark and dusty and full of trash.<br><br>She crossed over to the other side, trying to get farther away from the alley’s entrance, but a group of teens were standing there smoking pot. They looked at her with smirks on their faces – they knew what Mary was doing and were probably laughing at her behind her back. One of them leaned over and grabbed Mary by the shoulders, demanding that she hand over whatever she had in her pockets.<br><br>Mary Smith stood rooted to the spot, unable to move as John Doe pushed into her personal space. He demanded that she empty her pockets right then and Mary Smith panicked. She dug for her purse in her bag, hoping that inside were some items of value that she could give him. Instead, she only came up with some receipts and a few coins. She hoped those would suffice, but John Doe demanded more.  He got angry when she told him that this was all she had.<br><br>“You were just at the corner shop!” he screamed at her. “Didn’t you just buy something?”<br><br>Mary Smith wanted to cry. When John Doe realized that Mary Smith wasn’t going to give him more money, he moved in closer to her. Then she noticed the gun in his hand and she began to tremble.<br><br>“If you don’t give me everything, I’ll kill you,” he threatened. <br><br>Mary Smith reached into her bag again, hoping there was something else she could find to appease him. She felt around in her purse and eventually, her hand connected with the contents of her wallet — which John Doe was now demanding she hand over. Mary Smith did as John Doe told her and handed him the contents of her wallet.<br><br>He demanded more money, but at this point, Mary Smith only had change. John Doe began to look through her wallet in search of more cash but what he found was a photograph. He stared at it for a moment and then turned toward Mary Smith once again. <br><br>“Give me your phone,” he demanded. “I know you have one.”<br><br>Mary Smith suddenly realized that she had been so caught up in not giving him any more money that she hadn’t even considered the possibility that John Doe might want to take her phone. John Doe became angry when he found no other valuables in Mary Smith’s pocket; he told her to turn over the contents of her purse and to empty her pockets, but she had already removed everything that she thought he could possibly want.<br><br>She searched through her bag again but all that was inside was her purse, a few receipts, and a pack of gum — none of which John Doe apparently wanted.<br><br>Mary Smith began to feel hopeless. Surely there was nothing left of her belongings that could be of any value to John Doe. She started to become angry herself — how dare John Doe demand more from her",1

The town doctor can find no explanation for the visions.,"Julia’s mother came into her room, she was surprised to see Julia sitting up in bed, waiting for her.<br><br>“Did you have another bad dream?”<br><br>“Not really, Mommy. I just woke up a little while ago. Do you want to play a game?”<br><br>Julia’s mother again tried to get her daughter to forget about what had happened in the forest. She said that there was no reason for her daughter to worry about anything and that she would take care of things. She said that if Julia ever saw the man again, she should tell her mother right away. Julia promised that she would, but she wondered why her mother was so worried about the man in the car. He didn’t look like a bad man. He just looked like an ordinary man who was driving through town in an ordinary car. Why would it be so bad if she ever saw him again?<br><br>After a week or so more of being pushed out of her own bed and being sent back to her own room, Julia decided that she didn’t want to play games anymore. She couldn’t enjoy them when she was so worried about what might happen to her. She asked her mother if she would let her sleep in their bed again, and to her surprise, her mother said yes, but that Julia would have to promise not to mention the man in the car or go into the forest. Julia agreed to those terms, but she was troubled by her mother’s insistence that she not mention the man in the car or go into the forest. What was so bad about the man in the car? What was so bad about going into the forest?<br><br>That night, Julia and her mother went to bed and fell asleep quickly. Julia again slept soundly until she woke up in the middle of the night. She had a bad dream. She felt that something was wrong, but she didn’t have time to think about what it was before she was jolted out of her sleep by her mother’s screams. She quickly sat up in bed and listened, wondering what had awakened her mother so suddenly. To her horror, she heard her mother scream, “That’s him! That’s the man from the car! Everyone run!”<br><br>Julia got out of bed just as her mother screamed again, “He’s in the forest! Get out of there! He’s in the forest!”<br><br>Julia ran out of her bedroom and down to her mother’s room where she saw that her mother was standing in the middle of the room, pointing a gun at something outside of the window. She followed her mother’s gaze and saw a man standing outside of their bedroom window. He was smiling, and he looked very much like her father.<br><br>“Mom! Mom! What are you doing? Don’t shoot him!”<br><br>Her mother didn’t say anything. She just stood there, pointing the gun at the man. As Julia looked at her mother, she noticed that her mother didn’t look like herself. She looked angry and frightened, and she didn’t look like someone who would normally have a gun in her hand.<br><br>The man smiled and looked at Julia. He pointed at her mother and then at Julia. He said, “You better run, little girl. I wouldn’t want to hurt you.”<br><br>At that moment, Julia noticed that the man had one eye. She looked closer at his face and saw that he didn’t have a nose or a mouth. He was smiling, but his teeth and gums were completely absent. Julia started to cry, but she tried not to make any sound because she didn’t want her mother to shoot him.<br><br>Julia ran to her room and picked up her backpack. She put on a sweater and some shoes and then left the house. She didn’t know where to go, so she just followed the path through the forest that she and her father had once taken. She ran through the forest as fast as she could without knowing where she was going. When she finally stopped, she realized that she had no idea where she was. She was lost in the forest in the middle of the night with only a sweater and some shoes on her back.<br><br>She sat down on a fallen tree branch and started to cry softly. She wasn’t sure how long she had been lost, but her legs were very tired, and her shins were bleeding from the scrapes that they had gotten from running through the forest. She hoped that she would be able to find her way back to her house before she bled to death in the forest.<br><br>Julia stayed still for a while, thinking about her mother and her father. She wondered what had happened to them, and she hoped that they would be all right. She knew that her mother was going through some very difficult times, but she never would have thought that her mother would try to shoot her father.<br><br>After a while, Julia started to feel uncomfortable because of the way that she was sitting. She carefully stood up and started to walk through the forest again. She walked for a long time, but she still didn’t know where she was. She didn’t know how far she was from her house, and she didn’t know which direction to go in order to get back home. She decided that she had better find a tree that was large enough for her to climb in order to get a better view of the forest. She started to climb up the tree and looked around.<br><br>She saw that the sun was starting to rise in the east, and she realized that she was going to have to stay in the forest in order to survive. She wondered what would happen when the sun came out and started to heat up the forest. She hoped that she would be able to find enough food to survive until she could get some help.<br><br>She was starting to feel very tired and very hungry, and she knew that she wouldn  Julia’s mother came into her room, she was surprised to see Julia sitting up in bed, waiting for her.<br><br>“Did you have another bad dream?”<br><br>“Not really, Mommy.

The townspeople of Mayberry rally around Daisy and help her through her treatment.,"just been there for a few weeks now and it just won’t go away.”<br><br>	I looked at her, concerned, and nodded my head. “Well, when you go next week for the tests, maybe your doctor can give you something to keep your mind off of it until you get the results back,” I replied. “If it’s cancer, that will be the time to worry about it, not before.”<br><br>	She looked at me and nodded her head. “You’re probably right, Nick,” she replied. “I just don’t want to think about it at all right now.”<br><br>	She took a deep breath and looked at me. I watched as she wiped a few more tears from her eyes. “Nick, I really have to tell someone about this,” she said as she shook her head.<br><br>	“Okay,” I replied as I took a seat next to her on the bed. “Who do you want to tell?”<br><br>	She stared at me and lifted her shoulders up a few times. “I don’t know, Nick,” she replied. “I just feel like I have to tell someone.”<br><br>	I sighed and shook my head. “Melissa, I wish that there was something I could do to help you, but there really isn’t anything that I can think of,” I replied.<br><br>	“Well, for starters, you could just listen to me vent for a while,” she suggested. “Maybe that will help. Talk about something else and I’ll feel better.”<br><br>	I nodded my head and thought about it for a moment. “Okay,” I replied, and then she started telling me about her day at the hospital and how she got sick of answering the same questions over and over again.<br><br>	I listened to her for a while without saying anything. She told me about a conversation she had with an older woman whose daughter was diagnosed with cancer a few months prior. Melissa listened as the woman told her how lucky she was to have so many people around her who would do anything for her. The woman went on and on about how much her daughter loved the hospital staff and how they were the first family she had around her in a long time. She told Melissa that even if it wasn’t for her cancer, she would still love spending time with them. Melissa started to tear up at the end of the woman’s story and she looked at me.<br><br>	“I’m sorry I brought this all up to you, Nick,” she said. “I just felt like I needed to tell someone about it.”<br><br>	I shook my head and smiled. “Don’t worry about it, Melissa,” I replied. “I am always here for you. If you need me, you can always call me and I will come over right away.”<br><br>	I looked at her and she stared at me. “Do you want to talk about something else?” I asked.<br><br>	She stared at me and nodded her head. “Yeah,” she replied, smiling. “How about we talk about your day instead?”<br><br>	I smiled back at her and thought about how much I missed her when she was away at college. “Well, it was pretty quiet for the most part today,” I replied. “I got to sleep in a little bit and I went down to the diner for breakfast. George wasn’t even mad about me being late.”<br><br>	Melissa looked at me and smiled. “Of course not,” she replied. “You’re never late, Nick.”<br><br>	I looked at her and stared at her for a second. “What do you mean I’m never late?” I asked as I looked at her.<br><br>	She smiled at me and shook her head. “You never are, Nick. You are always on time to everything.”<br><br>	She did that little smirk thing with her lips and I started to giggle. “Well, what else is there to do around here?” I asked.<br><br>	She stared at me and shook her head slightly. “Okay, okay,” she replied as she smiled back at me. “We may live in the middle of nowhere, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t anything to do around here. We have a movie theater and a mall.”<br><br>	I stared at her and thought about it for a moment. “A mall?” I asked as I looked at her. “Where?”<br><br>	She looked at me and smiled. “In the next town over,” she replied. “Actually, it’s in the next state over. It is about twenty minutes away by car and it has everything you could possibly want. There is even a food court with six different restaurants.”<br><br>	I thought about it for a minute as she stared at me and then I started laughing. “Are you joking?” I asked.<br><br>	She looked at me and frowned. “No,” she replied. “What? There isn’t a mall here?”<br><br>	I shook my head as I smiled at her. “There are two gas stations and a few small stores,” I replied as I thought about the places she was talking about.<br><br>	She smiled at me and looked so cute. “I guess you are right,” she said as she laughed a little bit. “But, we don’t need a mall here anyway. We have all the basics covered and that is all we need.”<br><br>	I shook my head at her as I smiled. She was such a sweet woman and it was so easy to fall in",0
Jenna must learn to navigate her new life while also trying to find her attacker and bring them to justice.,"<br><br>Jenna looked around her. The room was filled with several beds and the odd piece of equipment. There were curtains on most of the windows, but one was wide open and showed a brick wall outside. She looked back at Liam before speaking again. “What’s your name?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam smiled at that. “My name is Liam Cross, and I promise that I will not hurt you, no matter what anyone else tells you.”<br><br>Jenna thought about things for a few more seconds before asking another question. “Does everyone become a vampire? Is that what this is?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam shook his head. “Most people don’t become vampires, and it is definitely not something that you want to happen to you,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna looked at him curiously before asking a question that she had been thinking about for the last several minutes. “Where am I? How did I get here?” asked Jenna.<br><br>Liam stared at her for a moment. “You are in the hospital,” said Liam, answering her second question first. “The police found you in an alley.”<br><br>Jenna looked at him to make sure he was telling the truth. She looked at the room around her, and then back at Liam. “Where is everyone else? I don’t see anyone else here,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam smiled for a moment before shaking his head. “You’re the only person here, right now, but the police are looking for other people who might have been with you at the time of your attack that they might have left behind. You were there quite a while before they found you, and you’re very lucky to be alive,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna looked around the room again, and then back at him. “I don’t understand what happened to me, but I feel like it was more than being attacked and left for dead in an alley,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam nodded for a moment before speaking again. “You are right about that, although I don’t know everything about what happened either,” said Liam. He pulled his jacket out from where he kept it under the chair by his bed, and handed it to  her. “When we meet someone for the first time, as is customary in our kind of society, we give them something small as a token of trust. I hope this isn’t too much for you to carry around with you,” said Liam.<br><br>Jenna took the jacket from him and slipped it on. It fit her perfectly, almost as if it was made for her. “No, not at all. Thank you,” said Jenna as she smiled and looked back at him.<br><br>He nodded for a few minutes before speaking again. “I want to tell you something else that might answer some questions you have,” said Liam. “When a vampire is about to change, we experience a few events that give us more insight into what is coming. You were probably going through this and may have not realized it, or just forgot about it. When I saw you in the alley, I knew exactly who you were and what had just happened to you,” said Liam as he leaned back more comfortably into his chair.<br><br>Jenna leaned forward slightly in her seat as she listened intently to what he was saying. She took a moment to think about what he said and decided to ask him a question as she leaned back in her chair. “In other words, you knew I was going to turn into a vampire,” said Jenna.<br><br>Liam looked up at the ceiling for a few seconds, and then looked back at her. “Yes, that is sort of what I’m saying. We all go through this when we are about to change,” he said as he looked back over at the front door.<br><br>Jenna shifted her eyes from one side of the room to another as she thought about how Elijah Sedgew ick might take what Liam was saying. She turned to look at the clock on the wall as she realized that it was late, and Elijah would be coming in soon if he wasn’t there already.<br><br>She turned away from the clock and back at Liam, who was still watching her carefully. “Where did you say you met each other?” asked Jenna as she shifted her weight in the chair.<br><br>“We met on the train to New York,” he said with a slight nod of his head. “I had just gotten on board and sat down in a seat next to you, as I was already quite tired from the trip up from Virginia. When I sat down you turned to look at me, and then took your phone out of your pocket and started typing away.”<br><br>Jenna listened as Liam spoke about their first meeting, but was having trouble picturing it in her mind. “Wait a minute,” she said as she looked at the clock and then back at Liam. “Are you saying that I got on this train by myself? When you first walked in here, I thought that I had been taken over by a vampire or something.”<br><br>Liam nodded. “Yes, and I know why you would think that. It is one of the things that leads up to a vampire’s transformation. They feel as if they are not traveling alone and have company with them on their journey, but when they look around they realize that no one else is there.”<br><br>Jenna nodded her head slowly trying to absorb everything Liam was telling her. “So that’s why I thought there was someone else in here with me?”<br><br>He nodded again. “It is possible because you were heading to New York, and I know that Antonia Rossi lives in New York. She is a very powerful vampire. She is the only person right now who holds the allegiance of most of the vampires in this country. She holds sway over a large number of vampires, both here and abroad. Every vampire who has turned to her for protection has been transformed into her kind. You have to go to New York and find her. She will be able to help you.”<br><br>Jenna moved away from the door, turning her back on Liam as she slid down until she was sitting on the floor in front of one of the seats. “New York ? What about Liam? I thought he was going with me.”<br><br>He shook his head solemnly. “I wish that I could, Jenna, but I can’t. Antonia is very powerful and has vast connections to all sorts of dark forces. If she finds out about me, then they will know that I am here. There wouldn’t be any point in traveling to NYC and going to her if she finds out that I am here. She would come looking for me immediately and, in the process, she would kill you.”<br><br>Jenna closed her eyes as she sighed heavily with resignation. “What’s the connection between Damian Henchman and Antonia? Why is he important to her?”<br><br>Liam looked at Jenna with a solemn expression as he said, “Damian is a vampire who has been to Italy recently. I think that you should go to Italy and find out if there are any clues to help you about your attacker. You could try New York first, but I think that it would be better if you went to Italy because it is less far away. Plus, it is closer to home for you",1
Jennifer decides to leave her family and start a new life.,"Well, your daddy and I are getting divorced. You won’t live with us anymore - not right now. Mama will look after you for awhile.”<br><br>Lily twisted around on Jennifer’s lap to look up into her eyes. Her dark brown eyes were full of concern and confusion. “But, but where will we live?”<br><br>“You and me, baby girl - just you and me. We have our own house now.” Jennifer laughed awkwardly, wiping away tears that had begun to form in her eyes again. “Mama has a new job, too.”<br><br>Lily was confused. She didn’t understand what Jennifer was saying. “Where are we going to live? We don’t have a house – not yet. Are we going to live in an apartment?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled, then took a deep breath before she filled them in. “No honey,” she began. “We bought our own house. You know how much I told you I wanted a backyard for the two of us? Well, I got it! We now live in a cul-de-sac, right by the park. It’s a real pretty neighborhood with lots of trees. We even have a swing in our front yard to play on.”<br><br>Lily was starting to understand what Jennifer was talking about, but something still didn’t add up. “Mama, I don’t understand. You said we were going to live at Grandma Jackie’s house.”<br><br>Lily sat up straight and looked at her mama with tear-filled eyes. “Can’t we go to Grandma Jackie? I like it there. What about the park? Can we still go to the park?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled, trying to hide her own tears. “Of course we can! We just don’t live in the same house anymore. We are still a family, just a different kind of family. I still love you as much as ever.”<br><br>Lily nodded and wiped her eyes. “I know, mama,” she started. “It’s just that I didn’t think daddy would do something like that. It was all so sudden, too. Now he won ’t even talk to me.”<br><br>Jennifer put her arm around Lily and pulled her close. “He probably doesn’t know what to say. You should try talking to him some more. I bet he wants you as much as ever. It takes time to get used to the changes.”<br><br>Lily pulled away and looked at Jennifer with a questioning face. “What changes?” she asked, her tone turning sarcastic. “You mean when daddy sells the old house and mama moves out?”<br><br>Jennifer smiled. “Maybe we can still come over and visit,” she said, moving toward the door.<br><br>Jennifer opened the door and moved into the hallway. She turned back to look at her daughter and smiled warmly. “Yes! You can move in with me for a while,” she said, trying to sound optimistic.  “I have a new job and you can go to the same school, and we’ll see how it goes. You might like living with me just as much.”<br><br>Lily shrugged. She had never liked change, but didn’t really have an opinion on this one way or another. “I guess so,” she said doubtfully. But her expression clearly showed her reluctance if Jennifer had looked closely enough.<br><br>Jennifer stepped out the door and walked down the stairs to the sidewalk below. The moving van was parked in front of her house, ready to take her furniture away. She turned back toward the side of the house and waved at her daughter, who was standing there with a group of children.<br><br>“Good-bye!” Jennifer called. Then she turned and moved to the front door across the street, where a middle-aged man stood waiting on the porch.<br><br>“Are you moving in?” the man asked.<br><br>“Yes, I am,” Jennifer answered. “You are moving out?”<br><br>“Yes, I am, too. You don’t look familiar. Are you moving to this neighborhood?”<br><br>“No, I moved from one street over, but I just started a new job and decided to move closer. Moving is such a hassle!”<br><br>The moving man laughed lightly. “I know what you mean. But at least it will be easier moving the rest of your stuff. Moving the big pieces is the worst part.”<br><br>“That’s true, but I want to move all my furniture to the new house today instead of dragging it here tomorrow and back again on Wednesday,” Jennifer said. “This way, I can unpack right away. Do you move furniture often?”<br><br>“Every couple of months. I moved a lot when I was younger, but now I prefer to stay in one place for years at a time. It saves me money, and it gives me more stability with my job. My wife prefers the same thing because moving is hard on the relationship. But it depends on our jobs. We move more when we get transferred to another city or state. Moving is such a hassle, but the longer you stay in one place the harder it is to move on short notice. It can be hard finding a new place if you have to move  quickly.”<br><br>The moving man stopped and picked up a picture frame. He was looking at Jennifer’s pictures of Samantha and Theresa as children, then he replaced the frame on the wall.<br><br>“Yeah, we have two kids, so we may move again in the next few years,” Jennifer said. “But we probably won’t move for a while after this, unless my husband gets transferred again. He’s not getting any younger, so who knows? It’s just nice to not have to move right now. I need some stability after everything that has happened.”<br><br>The moving man smiled and nodded his head in agreement.<br><br>“Moving is a hassle, but at least you can choose where to put everything in the new place. I don’t move very often, but when I do, it is fun to rearrange my stuff and make the place feel more like home. Moving is definitely stressful though. It’s hard to make friends if you move too often because it takes people longer to get to know you.”<br><br>The moving man grunted in response.<br><br>“Some people move all the time, and have a different group of friends at each place they move to. That way, they don’t really have to make any new friends. They already have a group of friends waiting for them wherever they go. That way, they don’t have to go through what you just did. They can move quickly from one place to the next. Moving is easier that way, especially if you have a big family. You can’t move so quickly when you are only moving some of your things, or when you are just moving yourself. Moving can be really easy if you plan ahead. It can also be hard though if you don’t plan ahead, or things don’t go according to your plan. Moving can be a hassle and stressful at times, but it can also be a lot of fun. You just have to know how to dealwith moving stress and keep things from getting too overwhelming.”<br><br>Another moving man came out of the house. He carried a small wooden table and two dining chairs to a nearby truck.<br><br>The moving man, Jennifer, and the other moving men stood at the side of the house as they continued to load and unload boxes from the truck. They moved quickly but carefully , keeping the tables and couches from hitting the walls or scratching the floors. They managed to fit all of Jennifer’s furniture into her small SUV, which had been loaded to the roof with boxes only moments before.<br><br>“Don’t worry, my friend. Everyone has their own methods for moving. If you think it is the right way to do things, then you keep doing it that way. If you want to make sure that everything gets put into place exactly how you want it, then that is what you do. It’s all about figuring out how your mind works and what works best for you. As long as it keeps working and you don’t keep moving, then you have a good way of doing things!”<br><br>The moving men smiled and nodded at Jennifer. They moved to the back of the truck and finished loading all of the furniture. The moving men packed everything into the truck with incredible skill and expert timing.<br><br>Jennifer moved to the passenger’s side of the SUV and picked up her bags. She walked back to side the house and noticed that three of the moving men were busy carrying box after box into the house, while a fourth was watching them from side a doorway. The moving man turned to watch Jennifer get into the side of the SUV.<br><br>“Hey! Why don’t you move in with us? We have some extra space right now and it would be nice to have another girl around. You can move in with us for as long as you need to, and we can move you into a different room when someone else needs to move in. We’re moving into a huge apartment later on and we don’t know anyone else yet. We’ll make sure that you are taken care of, okay?”<br><br>Moving men moved to back of the truck, and got into their side. They drove off towards the other end of the block, moving their way through traffic. Moving men had already done their previous moves and were heading to side their next move. Moving men were moving a lot today and had many moves lined up.<br><br>Jennifer moved back to side the door and thought for a moment.<br><br>This is Side Bar. This is where Jennifer will make her decision regarding moving in with the three moving men.<br><br>“I don’t know,” she said. “It sounds like a lot of responsibility. I don’t want to be a burden.”<br><br>“Don’t worry about it, we can handle it. Just say yes and come with us!”<br><br>Jennifer thought for a moment longer and then made her decision.<br><br>“Yes, I’ll move in with you.",1
Valerie makes it to safety and the police catch John Doe.,"a tight left turn as soon as she reached the stairs.<br><br>John Doe had thought that he would have been able to see Valerie Marx from the side of the house before then, but he had been wrong about that. There was no one in sight when Valerie ran away from him. This was a bad situation for Valerie because John Doe knew that she was in trouble. Her chances of surviving the night were slim to none, and John Doe had no intention of letting her get away with her life, so he decided that there was no point in following her.<br><br>Valerie Marx had successfully escaped from John Doe, but she wasn ’t safe yet because he could catch up with her at any moment. The police were just around the corner, and she was walking towards them even though she didn’t see them. It only took a few minutes for her to reach the police station since it was only a block away from her house, but John Doe could have easily caught up with her by then if he was able to move as fast as he did before, which would allow him to be close enough to kill her when she reached the police station.<br><br>Valerie Marx did not see the police when she arrived at the station because they were around a corner and around a car. This was good for John Doe because he had less of a chance of being spotted by them as long as he kept moving to the right side of the police station. It was also good for him because it gave him more time to think about what should be done next.<br><br>The police station might have been safe for Valerie, but it was not a safe place for John Doe to be because they would be able to easily see him if he went inside. They might have also been able to find out who he was from the information that he left behind in the basement. If they were  able to do that, then he might have ended up being under more suspicion than before. Because of those reasons, it was better for him to just keep running for now and wait until things cooled off before taking another victim.<br><br>If Valerie Marx walked inside the police station, then she would be safe from John Doe for now because the police would surround her and keep her from harm. On the other hand, Valerie did not want to go into the police station because she had more important places to go.<br><br>Male Celebrity A was not at the police station when Valerie Marx arrived there because he had gone to Valerie’s house to make sure she was safe. When Valerie arrived at her house, Male Celebrity A was already there. He took Valerie inside her house and locked the door so that John Doe could not get in. Male Celebrity A talked with Valerie while they were inside her home and comforted her as she went through what had just happened to her.<br><br>Valerie was glad when Male Celebrity A arrived because she had been starting to feel alone and scared after moving house and changing jobs. She explained everything that happened in the basement to Male Celebrity A, including how she got there and why she was moving house. She told Male Celebrity A how scared she had been and how she was moving house because of the situation with John Doe, but also because her old apartment building was right next to an old graveyard. Valerie was in a bad way because moving house like that would make anyone feel alone, and she needed someone to support her through that kind of ordeal. <br><br>Male Celebrity A listened to everything Valerie said without saying anything for a long time. After he finished listening, he said that Valerie had done a brave thing when she went into the basement to confront John Doe.<br><br>Male Celebrity A was very happy when he heard what Valerie had done. He did not think it would be brave to visit a murderer in a dark basement, but Male Celebrity A knew that Valerie had wanted to do that and was happy that she did.<br><br>Male Celebrity A told Valerie that she was very brave because she had stood up to the killer after waking up tied up, without being able to move or speak. He said that it was a very scary thing to do, but she had done it and was safe now.<br><br>Valerie Marx was happy to hear what Male Celebrity A said. It made her feel better about herself and the situation.",1
"Jenna Riley, a 21-year-old woman, is attacked and left for dead.","The darkness enveloped Jenna Riley in a blanket of safety. She had just gotten home from her night shift at the local diner. Having worked in the kitchen made her skin and hands smell like grease, but it didn’t bother her. It was a sort of pungent aroma that she had grown to associate with the diner, not only that, but it was also a reminder and comfort of her hard-working, reliable personality.<br><br>Jenna’s dark blue jeep was parked in front of her small home on one of the main streets of Twin Peaks. A few houses down from hers was an abandoned factory. One could see the sign that read Twin Peaks High on top of it. It was surrounded by vacant lots and trees.<br><br>Jenna exited her car, locked the doors, and started walking up to her house. The light from her porch lamp shone down on her as she pushed the front door open and stepped inside. She set her purse on top of the kitchen counter and tossed her keys in a bowl on the shelf next to her front door.<br><br>“Hi mom,” Jenna called as she walked into the living room of her small five-room, two bedroom house.<br><br>Her mother turned around from the kitchen and gave her an encouraging smile. “Hey. How was work?” she asked.<br><br>“Tiring, but nothing new there.” Jenna took off her apron and tossed it on the counter.<br><br>Jenna turned around and faced her mother, who was now standing at the counter taking out some spaghetti noodles from a box. “It’s getting to be that time again when you have to start looking for a new job, isn’t it?”<br><br>Jenna shrugged and sat down on the couch. “Yeah, it is. Not sure if I want to go back to college or just find a different job.”<br><br>“I think you should try college. You always said that you wanted to become a lawyer. You don’t want to let that slip away,” her mother said.<br><br>Jenna nodded and started eating her food. Her mother walked back into the kitchen and continued making dinner. Jenna finished her meal shortly after and decided to go straight to bed since she had to get up early the next morning.<br><br>Jenna walked back into her bedroom and was about to go in when she heard something to the left of the door. Jenna stopped in her tracks and listened. She heard the scurrying of feet coming from outside her house. She slowly pressed her ear against the door and listened, straining her ears to hear. Jenna put a hand on the doorknob and turned it slowly so that she could keep her ear pressed against it.<br><br>Jenna heard the scurrying noise once again and turned her head slightly to make sure nobody was watching her. She slowly opened the door a crack and peeked out of it. A shadow moved past the side of the house. Jenna saw a pair of feet run past her door and head down towards the abandoned factory.<br><br>Jenna walked out of her house and followed the shadow to the factory. She walked towards it with a slow gait, making sure to keep to the shadows as well as she could. She stopped when she reached the trees surrounding the factory and looked around, making sure nobody was watching her.<br><br>A couple of seconds later, Jenna heard the scurrying noise again. She followed it to a corner of the factory and saw a figure sprint out of the corner. Jenna recognized the figure, and immediately felt anger welling up within her.<br><br>Jenna ducked down into the shadows and followed the figure as it ran around the factory. She tried to keep a close eye on it, but the figure kept darting around corners and behind walls. Jenna felt her anger grow as she followed the figure. It sprinted past a row of cars, and Jenna noticed that it was keeping to the shadows of the cars so that nobody could see it in its hiding place.<br><br>The figure stopped after a couple of minutes and looked around nervously. It held its breath for a moment and then took off once again. Jenna followed closely behind, keeping to the shadows.<br><br>A couple minutes later, the figure took off down a small alley that ran between two houses. Jenna followed quietly behind, making sure not to be seen by anybody.<br><br>When she reached the end of the alley, Jenna saw the figure stop and lean against the wall of a house. Jenna paused for a second as she stood in front of the house. She took her time looking around, making sure nobody was watching her. Satisfied that she was alone, Jenna continued around to the other side of the house, where the figure was waiting for her.<br><br>The figure had turned around and now stood in front of the wall with her back to Jenna. Jenna walked around to the front of the figure and stood next to it. The figure held its breath and looked around again. It then took off down the alley that Jenna had just come through. Jenna followed closely behind it, keeping to the shadows.<br><br>A couple of minutes later, the figure stopped in front of another house. It again leaned against the wall and looked around. When it seemed satisfied that nobody was watching, it took off down the alley once again. Jenna followed behind it, continuing to keep to the shadows as much as possible.<br><br>They ran past two more houses before reaching a dead end. At the end of the alley, a fence blocked their way. Jenna’s breath caught in her throat as she saw the figure go up to the fence and leap over it. Jenna looked around quickly to make sure nobody had seen it jump the fence. When she was satisfied that nobody had, she ran up to the fence and put her hands on it. Jenna jumped as far as she could and landed on top of the fence. She walked down to the ground and stood next to a trash can, trying to catch her breath.<br><br>Jenna heard the scurrying sound again and looked behind her. The figure",0
Mary Smith walks home from work and becomes the victim of a mugging attempt by John Doe.,"The alley was dark. It was a short walk from the corner where Mary Smith had been walking, but she still didn’t trust it. Mary fidgeted the whole way, watching all around her for anyone who might be lurking in the shadows. She didn’t like this alley; it was dark and dusty and full of trash.<br><br>She crossed over to the other side, trying to get farther away from the alley’s entrance, but a group of teens were standing there smoking pot. They looked at her with smirks on their faces – they knew what Mary was doing and were probably laughing at her behind her back. One of them leaned over and grabbed Mary by the shoulders, demanding that she hand over whatever she had in her pockets.<br><br>Mary Smith stood rooted to the spot, unable to move as John Doe pushed into her personal space. He demanded that she empty her pockets right then and Mary Smith panicked. She dug for her purse in her bag, hoping that inside were some items of value that she could give him. Instead, she only came up with some receipts and a few coins. She hoped those would suffice, but John Doe demanded more.  He got angry when she told him that this was all she had.<br><br>“You were just at the corner shop!” he screamed at her. “Didn’t you just buy something?”<br><br>Mary Smith wanted to cry. When John Doe realized that Mary Smith wasn’t going to give him more money, he moved in closer to her. Then she noticed the gun in his hand and she began to tremble.<br><br>“If you don’t give me everything, I’ll kill you,” he threatened. <br><br>Mary Smith reached into her bag again, hoping there was something else she could find to appease him. She felt around in her purse and eventually, her hand connected with the contents of her wallet — which John Doe was now demanding she hand over. Mary Smith did as John Doe told her and handed him the contents of her wallet.<br><br>He demanded more money, but at this point, Mary Smith only had change. John Doe began to look through her wallet in search of more cash but what he found was a photograph. He stared at it for a moment and then turned toward Mary Smith once again. <br><br>“Give me your phone,” he demanded. “I know you have one.”<br><br>Mary Smith suddenly realized that she had been so caught up in not giving him any more money that she hadn’t even considered the possibility that John Doe might want to take her phone. John Doe became angry when he found no other valuables in Mary Smith’s pocket; he told her to turn over the contents of her purse and to empty her pockets, but she had already removed everything that she thought he could possibly want.<br><br>She searched through her bag again but all that was inside was her purse, a few receipts, and a pack of gum — none of which John Doe apparently wanted.<br><br>Mary Smith began to feel hopeless. Surely there was nothing left of her belongings that could be of any value to John Doe. She started to become angry herself — how dare John Doe demand more from her",1
"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.","and we might be able to meet up more frequently. Do you want to go to NYC?”<br><br>Jenna shook her head in response as she replied, “If I go to Italy, I’ll have to talk with Antonia and Damian at some point. Why can’t I just go there and talk with them now?”<br><br>Liam shrugged his shoulders as he said, “I don’t know. She did say that you shouldn’t come back to the US for a while. This might have something to do with it. But if we don’t go, you won’t be able to help me in any way, because I can’t tell Antonia and Damian about being bitten by Dracula. Who knows what they are capable of doing?”<br><br>Jenna understood the danger that could be in store for Liam if he told anyone about his bite. She also knew that he was right – she wouldn’t be able to help him if she didn’t go to Italy. Getting back to her attacker was her only priority at this moment, and she had to do whatever it took. “Ok, I’ll go to NYC with you, but first we will have to talk with Randolph Howe. Once we are done, I’ll head off to Italy.”<br><br>Liam nodded in agreement as he said, “Deal!” Jenna was feeling happy that they were going to see Randolph Howe again; she liked him, and she trusted his knowledge of vampires.<br><br>They found the vampire community easily. It was still quite early when they arrived, so only a handful of people were walking about. Everybody seemed to be going about their business quietly and respectfully, which made for a very peaceful first impression. As they walked towards the community, Jenna felt a bit uneasy. It seemed like everyone had heard of her – there were many people looking at them as if they were some kind of celebrities.<br><br>It also seemed like everyone knew that she was missing, and had returned; most vampires around here looked surprised to see her. Some didn ’t seem as surprised, and Jenna recognized the looks on their faces. They were the faces of people who knew that she had been hurt, because they had been there when it happened.<br><br>Randolph was already sitting at his desk when they arrived at the community building, but he did stand up and greet Jenna. “Jenna, good to see you again!” He then reached out his hand to Liam. “And you must be Liam Cross?”<br><br>“Yes, sir, I am. I think we have met before?” Jenna noticed that Gregory Maldonado was sitting in the corner of the office, listening in.<br><br>“I don’t think so. But I do recognize you from pictures and stuff. You are Gregory Maldonado’s son, right?”<br><br>Gregory nodded quietly. “That is correct.”<br><br>Liam smiled at Gregory. It was a stiff smile, but he was trying to be polite. “Nice to meet you, sir.”<br><br>Gregory nodded back to him. “Likewise, Mr. Cross. Now, let us move into a private room; we can talk there.” Gregory Maldonado then stood up and gestured for them to follow him.<br><br>They moved into the next room, which was a rather large office with a large desk.<br><br>Gregory sat down behind the desk, and then gestured for them to sit across from him. “Now, let us move on to the reason why you are here. Jenna, I have heard through channels that you are trying to track down Gregory Maldonado’s son?”<br><br>“Yes sir, I am. He is guilty of several crimes that he has committed in Seattle and now in my  town. I want to know where he is so I can bring him to justice.”<br><br>Gregory Maldonado laughed quietly at her words. “Really? Do you truly think he will be brought to justice if you do find him?”<br><br>Liam was starting to get nervous at this conversation. It sounded like something was being set up here, but he didn’t know what it was.<br><br>Jenna gave Gregory an annoyed look. “I do, actually. I just need to find him first so that I can give the evidence I have to the FBI.”<br><br>“You are working for them now, and yet you want to turn your back on them? There is no need to do that. I have people that can help you track down his son, and then they will turn their attention to Antonia Rossi. She has a few people keeping an eye on the club tonight, but I am sure we can move it somewhere else for a night or two. But if we do that, then it would be better if we did it now, as opposed to later. If we wait too long, we will have a lot more eyes on us.<br><br>Liam was starting to get really nervous at this point. He moved a little closer to Jenna just in case he needed to shield her or something.<br><br>Jenna took a couple of seconds to think about this before speaking again. “Moving the club is okay with me, but moving it tonight might be a bad idea.”<br><br>“Moving it to somewhere safe is not a problem. Moving it to somewhere that our enemies can attack without fear of getting hurt would probably be a poor decision. Moving the club now might be an even worse idea though.”<br><br>This was starting to sound like moving the club was a bad idea no matter what.<br><br>Jenna looked over at Antonia. “Moving the club tonight is completely out of the question. We have a huge event tonight at Club Red, and everyone is looking forward to it. Why not move it to another club tomorrow?”<br><br>“Tomorrow night might be a better choice, anyway. If you move the club now, no one would know what or where the change was, and that could make matters even worse for you. You would then have to deal with the people who knew you might move the  club, as well as those who guessed right and chose to follow you there.”<br><br>Jenna looked at Antonia for a little while. This made sense, so she said, “I guess I could postpone the move until tomorrow. Yes, I will be sure that everyone knows what’s happening by the end of tonight.”<br><br>Antonia Rossi nodded a few times, and then said, “I would be happy to help with whatever you need when it comes to your attacker. I do not have much experience with that sort of thing, but I know others who may be able to help  me.”<br><br>Jenna sighed and said, “Okay. I appreciate that. But I have a feeling that the person who did this is going to be killed tonight, if they aren’t already.”<br><br>Antonia Rossi looked at Jenna for a long time and said, “What makes you think that? It seems that only Damian was seen leaving your alley, and he was arrested shortly thereafter.”<br><br>“I saw him leave my alleyway, but not after he assaulted me. He had a knife in his hand. I even got a good look at it, and I know that there’s no way that he could have killed me if he was holding it. He may have moved to the alleyway after he stabbed me, but did so much later. I’m not sure of the exact time frame, but it was definitely after the attack. And if he moved to my alleyway after the attack, then maybe he ran into Damian Henchman there, which is why he was arrested.”<br><br>Damian Henchman said, “Jenna, that is a possibility. Damian has already been questioned by the police about what happened to you. It is possible that they talked about moving to your alleyway. But why would you think that only one person was responsible for your attack?”<br><br>“Because I didn’t see anyone else that night. I didn’t hear anyone else, either. And I definitely didn’t feel anyone moving around me in the dark.”<br><br>Antonia piped up, “Jenna is right. She was moving around a lot with her superhuman speed and agility, and she would have noticed if someone was anywhere near her.”<br><br>“Well, I can tell you that someone was moving around, because I did feel something,” said Jenna. “But it was only one thing moving around me. For the most part, that thing just held still and waited for the right time to pounce. So I moved around a little bit myself to figure out what was going on, but then it moved in the same minute that I did. And then it just held still while I tried to fight back, and then it jumped on me, picked me up, and carried me away from wherever I was walking. Then it carried me over to the alleyway between your club and my apartment building. And then it  stabbed me, and I don’t really remember anything after that.”<br><br>Dread filled Jenna’s heart as she thought about everything she had been through. This was certainly the worst thing that had ever happened to her in her entire life, and yet it wasn’t even close to the worst attack that had been made against her.<br><br>All around them, everyone watched and listened intently.<br><br>“This is a very serious accusation you are making, Miss Riley,” said Judge White. “There is no proof that Damian Henchman is your attacker at all. You were found covered with blood in a back alley, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he attacked you there. In fact, it doesn’t even necessarily mean that he attacked you at all. The evidence will be presented tomorrow morning. Until then, Mr. Henchman will remain in custody here at the courthouse.”<br><br>Jenna nodded, and they exited the courtroom together. They moved to a separate room in the basement of the courthouse, a holding cell where they could speak privately and still be guarded by both security personnel and police officers. Judge White ordered security to escort both Jenna and Henchman into this room. They moved to the room, accompanied by four security guards and a detective who had worked on the case.<br><br>The courtroom was large and imposing. The holding cell was small and cramped. Jasper moved to one corner of it, opposite the door, while Damian moved to another corner opposite him. Jenna took up a position in the middle of the room, facing both men.<br><br>Jenna was standing very still, staring intently at Damian Henchman. It was clear that she had moved past being just angry to being downright furious with him now. She had stopped herself from attacking him, but only barely—she could feel that she was holding herself back by a thread of willpower alone.<br><br>Damian moved to the center of the room as well, facing Jenna. His face was clean-shaven now, and he did not look like himself at all. He looked smaller, more vulnerable than before. He moved to the center of the room, moving past a metal divider that separated Jenna from him.<br><br>Jenna moved to one side of the divider, away from Damian Henchman.<br><br>Damian looked at Jasper, then to one of the security officers in the room, gesturing with his head for them to leave. The security officer nodded and moved to the door, opening it and gesturing for the other three men to leave as well.<br><br>The detective lingered for a moment, looking first at Jenna, then at Damian. He hesitated, then moved to leave as well.<br><br>Jenna watched the men leave, then turned her attention back to Damian.<br><br>""You attacked me,"" she said, her voice low and dangerous. It was not a question.<br><br>Damian swallowed, but did not say anything. He looked away from Jenna's gaze.<br><br>""Why?"" Jenna asked. ""What did I ever do to you?""<br><br>Damian shook his head. ""You didn't do anything,"" he said. ""It wasn't personal.""<br><br>""Not personal?"" Jenna repeated, her voice incredulous. ""You nearly killed me, and you say it wasn't personal?""",1

Gabriel learns to navigate his new life while still keeping his sanity.,"<br><br>Gabriel had a gas oven with two burners, so he could only bake one item at a time. He had to make sure that he left enough space between each item to be able to open the oven door and remove the finished dish without having to move any other dishes. He needed a lot of freezer space because he could only store a few items in his refrigerator at a time.<br><br>Gabriel had lived on his own before, so he knew how to cook simple meals. But now, Gabriel was living on his own for the first time, and he was learning how to cook more fancy dishes. He moved into his tiny apartment with a small kitchen, so he had to learn to get creative.<br><br>Gabriel was originally from a small town in Colorado, where there were many scenic hiking trails and biking routes. However, Gabriel was in the city now, where there were not many hiking or biking trails nearby. Gabriel liked going to the local park and jogging on the paved trails. Gabriel lived close to the beach, where he enjoyed hanging out at the boardwalk with his friends. Gabriel was doing all of these things to keep himself busy and stay active while he looked for a job.<br><br>Gabriel had a big social circle, since he attended college in a large city, where he met many people from all over the world. Gabriel stayed in touch with these people, and it was nice to have a support network of friends when moving to a new city. Gabriel had some family members who lived nearby. Gabriel moved closer to them so that they could take care of him if he ever needed anything.<br><br>Gabriel started looking for a job right away, but he had no luck at first. Gabriel was unsure what kind of job to be looking for because he did not have enough experience in any one field yet.  There was a period of time when Gabriel could not find a job. Gabriel did not like living off of his savings, but he had to use them until he could find a job. Gabriel’s parents wanted him to stay on their health insurance plan back home, since it was cheaper. Gabriel still paid rent and bills in the city where he lived. Gabriel did not want to fall behind in paying his bills.<br><br>Once Gabriel found a job, he earned enough money to pay his expenses easily without having to rely on his savings. Gabriel made enough money to visit the local bars and clubs with his friends, but he did not  go out as much as they did. Gabriel had a girlfriend now, and he wanted to spend more time with her instead of his other friends.<br><br>Gabriel started dating Lina Sanchez. He met her at one of the places where he had gone out with his friends in the past few weeks. Lina Sanchez was Gabriel’s friend’s ex-girlfriend, but she became his girlfriend after a while.<br><br>Lina Sanchez was Gabriel’s first girlfriend from a different culture. She was from Italy, and she studied creative writing at a local university in Denver. She came to America when she was nineteen years old. Gabriel met her when he was twenty years old.<br><br>Gabriel met her at a bar where Lina Sanchez used to go with her family. Her parents owned the restaurant, and they were there most of the time. They spoke Italian and English with their customers when they ate there. Gabriel met Lina Sanchez while he was out with his friends drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.<br><br>Gabriel met her because she was a beautiful girl. She had dark brown eyes, brunette hair, and olive skin. She had a slender body and long black hair that reached down to her waistline.  She always wore fashionable clothes, and she looked like a Hollywood actress.<br><br>They started to get closer after a few weeks. Gabriel walked her home one night, and they kissed each other in front of the restaurant while Lina Sanchez’s parents were watching. They did not do anything else that night, but they started to date after that. They went on many dates, and Gabriel met her parents after a few months.<br><br>Gabriel felt like he was dating an older woman from the beginning of their relationship because she was nineteen years old when they met, and Gabriel was only twenty years old when they started dating.  He thought that he acted more mature than she did, and he considered himself to be a more grown-up person than she was.<br><br>After almost two years together, they moved in together into a little apartment. They were officially boyfriend and girlfriend, but they still acted as if they were children living at home with their parents. When they moved into the apartment, Gabriel had a lot of stuff that he brought from his parents’ house. He also had some books and other items that he bought for his apartment. He had to rearrange all of them because there was not much space in the small room.<br><br>They went out many times during the next couple of weeks, and Gabriel’s friends were visiting the apartment often to meet his girlfriend. They started to talk about relationship problems when they were bored, so for a couple of hours Gabriel and Lina talked about their relationship issues. They seemed to work through some of them when they moved in together.<br><br>Gabriel felt that he needed to be more mature, and he thought that he was not ready for this kind of responsibility after only two years together with her. He was worried that they were growing apart, but he did not know how to express these feelings to her. <br><br>He did not feel like a grown-up yet. He continued to ask his parents for money now and then, even though he was twenty years old and had a steady job. He would not stop talking about his parents when they visited the apartment, even though he lived there for almost two months already. Gabriel felt that he was still a teenager, but his behavior did not help him feel like an independent man in a relationship with a young woman.<br><br>Gabriel started to feel that he was in love with Lina because she seemed to be the best thing that happened to him lately. She was better than his new apartment, and better than his new job, but Gabriel started to feel that this was not enough for a happy relationship. He wanted more; he wanted to feel responsible and independent.<br><br>Gabriel decided that he was going to talk about this issue with her. He felt guilty and afraid at the same time; it was not easy to face the idea that they might not be on the same page anymore.",1

It was such a weird decision to have him talk like that for five seconds.<br><br>Lol thats what I said. I was like ohhh you mean to tell me he was actually talking English the whole time?</s>You had me at “nose-fucking” 😍<br><br>Nose fucking is one of my favorite things ever!<br><br>I wish it was mine, too!   You have amazing content on your page. Looking forward to more!</s>If you can get ahold of it and have the money, do it.

I think my friends will enjoy it a lot more than I do, which is why i want to play so badly 😂</s>You could watch TV on your phone?<br><br>Yes. It’s hard enough to see what’s happening on most smartphones and tablets.</s>I did this last year! I had a great time. Anybody who is looking for a good league to join should jump on this while they can.<br><br>I did it last year as well, but man, the last 3 weeks or so are brutal.  Your schedule gets brutal in the last 3 weeks and it takes up all of your free time.   That being said, it was a blast.</s>I didn’t think I was going to like this one all that much, but it’s actually pretty awesome. If I had to guess, I would say the secret sauce that makes this work is the combination of the black pepper and allspice.<br><br>And, yes, that’s a different jar of mustard on my desk. That’s the only one they had at the store, and I couldn’t wait until tomorrow to buy a different one. Dijon is good and all, but it’s not my favorite.</s>I have the same problem too,  I don’t see how they could fix this with the current format of the site but I hope they do<br><br>They could do it through an overhaul somehow, I just don’t know how. One thing they could do is show your own post and comments first, or show your post and comments first until you scroll down a bit<br><br>It’s really annoying man, I’ve just accepted the fact that I can’t see my own posts<br><br>That’s probably easier than trying to get a reply from a Reddit admin, or trying to use the filters to avoid comments on your own post</s>I have that same type of carpal tunnel pain! Not as nearly as bad as in your case. I would ask the doc if you could go in for a steroid shot.<br><br>I have a cortisone shot when I was first diagnosed but the pain didn’t go away. They were thinking about giving me another one but I got pregnant and couldn’t have it done. I think I’ll go back to get one now since the pain is back!</s>That was a good, well informed article.

It could be a coincidence but I have met more people who do not have children than people who do.<br><br>I can only speak from my personal experience, but it seems to be the case across the board from what I see in comments and posts on social media.  I think you haven’t realized because the childfree people are the ones that are posting about the bad experiences they have.</s>Please go to the police.",0

"Along the way, Jenna will make new friends and enemies, and discover the truth about her attacker.","and we might be able to meet up more frequently. Do you want to go to NYC?”<br><br>Jenna shook her head in response as she replied, “If I go to Italy, I’ll have to talk with Antonia and Damian at some point. Why can’t I just go there and talk with them now?”<br><br>Liam shrugged his shoulders as he said, “I don’t know. She did say that you shouldn’t come back to the US for a while. This might have something to do with it. But if we don’t go, you won’t be able to help me in any way, because I can’t tell Antonia and Damian about being bitten by Dracula. Who knows what they are capable of doing?”<br><br>Jenna understood the danger that could be in store for Liam if he told anyone about his bite. She also knew that he was right – she wouldn’t be able to help him if she didn’t go to Italy. Getting back to her attacker was her only priority at this moment, and she had to do whatever it took. “Ok, I’ll go to NYC with you, but first we will have to talk with Randolph Howe. Once we are done, I’ll head off to Italy.”<br><br>Liam nodded in agreement as he said, “Deal!” Jenna was feeling happy that they were going to see Randolph Howe again; she liked him, and she trusted his knowledge of vampires.<br><br>They found the vampire community easily. It was still quite early when they arrived, so only a handful of people were walking about. Everybody seemed to be going about their business quietly and respectfully, which made for a very peaceful first impression. As they walked towards the community, Jenna felt a bit uneasy. It seemed like everyone had heard of her – there were many people looking at them as if they were some kind of celebrities.<br><br>It also seemed like everyone knew that she was missing, and had returned; most vampires around here looked surprised to see her. Some didn ’t seem as surprised, and Jenna recognized the looks on their faces. They were the faces of people who knew that she had been hurt, because they had been there when it happened.<br><br>Randolph was already sitting at his desk when they arrived at the community building, but he did stand up and greet Jenna. “Jenna, good to see you again!” He then reached out his hand to Liam. “And you must be Liam Cross?”<br><br>“Yes, sir, I am. I think we have met before?” Jenna noticed that Gregory Maldonado was sitting in the corner of the office, listening in.<br><br>“I don’t think so. But I do recognize you from pictures and stuff. You are Gregory Maldonado’s son, right?”<br><br>Gregory nodded quietly. “That is correct.”<br><br>Liam smiled at Gregory. It was a stiff smile, but he was trying to be polite. “Nice to meet you, sir.”<br><br>Gregory nodded back to him. “Likewise, Mr. Cross. Now, let us move into a private room; we can talk there.” Gregory Maldonado then stood up and gestured for them to follow him.<br><br>They moved into the next room, which was a rather large office with a large desk.<br><br>Gregory sat down behind the desk, and then gestured for them to sit across from him. “Now, let us move on to the reason why you are here. Jenna, I have heard through channels that you are trying to track down Gregory Maldonado’s son?”<br><br>“Yes sir, I am. He is guilty of several crimes that he has committed in Seattle and now in my  town. I want to know where he is so I can bring him to justice.”<br><br>Gregory Maldonado laughed quietly at her words. “Really? Do you truly think he will be brought to justice if you do find him?”<br><br>Liam was starting to get nervous at this conversation. It sounded like something was being set up here, but he didn’t know what it was.<br><br>Jenna gave Gregory an annoyed look. “I do, actually. I just need to find him first so that I can give the evidence I have to the FBI.”<br><br>“You are working for them now, and yet you want to turn your back on them? There is no need to do that. I have people that can help you track down his son, and then they will turn their attention to Antonia Rossi. She has a few people keeping an eye on the club tonight, but I am sure we can move it somewhere else for a night or two. But if we do that, then it would be better if we did it now, as opposed to later. If we wait too long, we will have a lot more eyes on us.<br><br>Liam was starting to get really nervous at this point. He moved a little closer to Jenna just in case he needed to shield her or something.<br><br>Jenna took a couple of seconds to think about this before speaking again. “Moving the club is okay with me, but moving it tonight might be a bad idea.”<br><br>“Moving it to somewhere safe is not a problem. Moving it to somewhere that our enemies can attack without fear of getting hurt would probably be a poor decision. Moving the club now might be an even worse idea though.”<br><br>This was starting to sound like moving the club was a bad idea no matter what.<br><br>Jenna looked over at Antonia. “Moving the club tonight is completely out of the question. We have a huge event tonight at Club Red, and everyone is looking forward to it. Why not move it to another club tomorrow?”<br><br>“Tomorrow night might be a better choice, anyway. If you move the club now, no one would know what or where the change was, and that could make matters even worse for you. You would then have to deal with the people who knew you might move the  club, as well as those who guessed right and chose to follow you there.”<br><br>Jenna looked at Antonia for a little while. This made sense, so she said, “I guess I could postpone the move until tomorrow. Yes, I will be sure that everyone knows what’s happening by the end of tonight.”<br><br>Antonia Rossi nodded a few times, and then said, “I would be happy to help with whatever you need when it comes to your attacker. I do not have much experience with that sort of thing, but I know others who may be able to help  me.”<br><br>Jenna sighed and said, “Okay. I appreciate that. But I have a feeling that the person who did this is going to be killed tonight, if they aren’t already.”<br><br>Antonia Rossi looked at Jenna for a long time and said, “What makes you think that? It seems that only Damian was seen leaving your alley, and he was arrested shortly thereafter.”<br><br>“I saw him leave my alleyway, but not after he assaulted me. He had a knife in his hand. I even got a good look at it, and I know that there’s no way that he could have killed me if he was holding it. He may have moved to the alleyway after he stabbed me, but did so much later. I’m not sure of the exact time frame, but it was definitely after the attack. And if he moved to my alleyway after the attack, then maybe he ran into Damian Henchman there, which is why he was arrested.”<br><br>Damian Henchman said, “Jenna, that is a possibility. Damian has already been questioned by the police about what happened to you. It is possible that they talked about moving to your alleyway. But why would you think that only one person was responsible for your attack?”<br><br>“Because I didn’t see anyone else that night. I didn’t hear anyone else, either. And I definitely didn’t feel anyone moving around me in the dark.”<br><br>Antonia piped up, “Jenna is right. She was moving around a lot with her superhuman speed and agility, and she would have noticed if someone was anywhere near her.”<br><br>“Well, I can tell you that someone was moving around, because I did feel something,” said Jenna. “But it was only one thing moving around me. For the most part, that thing just held still and waited for the right time to pounce. So I moved around a little bit myself to figure out what was going on, but then it moved in the same minute that I did. And then it just held still while I tried to fight back, and then it jumped on me, picked me up, and carried me away from wherever I was walking. Then it carried me over to the alleyway between your club and my apartment building. And then it  stabbed me, and I don’t really remember anything after that.”<br><br>Dread filled Jenna’s heart as she thought about everything she had been through. This was certainly the worst thing that had ever happened to her in her entire life, and yet it wasn’t even close to the worst attack that had been made against her.<br><br>All around them, everyone watched and listened intently.<br><br>“This is a very serious accusation you are making, Miss Riley,” said Judge White. “There is no proof that Damian Henchman is your attacker at all. You were found covered with blood in a back alley, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he attacked you there. In fact, it doesn’t even necessarily mean that he attacked you at all. The evidence will be presented tomorrow morning. Until then, Mr. Henchman will remain in custody here at the courthouse.”<br><br>Jenna nodded, and they exited the courtroom together. They moved to a separate room in the basement of the courthouse, a holding cell where they could speak privately and still be guarded by both security personnel and police officers. Judge White ordered security to escort both Jenna and Henchman into this room. They moved to the room, accompanied by four security guards and a detective who had worked on the case.<br><br>The courtroom was large and imposing. The holding cell was small and cramped. Jasper moved to one corner of it, opposite the door, while Damian moved to another corner opposite him. Jenna took up a position in the middle of the room, facing both men.<br><br>Jenna was standing very still, staring intently at Damian Henchman. It was clear that she had moved past being just angry to being downright furious with him now. She had stopped herself from attacking him, but only barely—she could feel that she was holding herself back by a thread of willpower alone.<br><br>Damian moved to the center of the room as well, facing Jenna. His face was clean-shaven now, and he did not look like himself at all. He looked smaller, more vulnerable than before. He moved to the center of the room, moving past a metal divider that separated Jenna from him.<br><br>Jenna moved to one side of the divider, away from Damian Henchman.<br><br>Damian looked at Jasper, then to one of the security officers in the room, gesturing with his head for them to leave. The security officer nodded and moved to the door, opening it and gesturing for the other three men to leave as well.<br><br>The detective lingered for a moment, looking first at Jenna, then at Damian. He hesitated, then moved to leave as well.<br><br>Jenna watched the men leave, then turned her attention back to Damian.<br><br>""You attacked me,"" she said, her voice low and dangerous. It was not a question.<br><br>Damian swallowed, but did not say anything. He looked away from Jenna's gaze.<br><br>""Why?"" Jenna asked. ""What did I ever do to you?""<br><br>Damian shook his head. ""You didn't do anything,"" he said. ""It wasn't personal.""<br><br>""Not personal?"" Jenna repeated, her voice incredulous. ""You nearly killed me, and you say it wasn't personal?""",1

The gym was empty for the first few weeks but as soon as New Years came around all of a sudden there was a line of people waiting to get in.

Kyle comforts Aimee and the two share a heart-to-heart conversation that leaves Aimee feeling understood for the first time.,"<br><br>Kyle looked at her with pity in his eyes, not judging her for acting childishly. “You know, Aimee, I think everyone feels that way at times. You aren’t the only one who gets nervous when you’re alone in a room full of strangers or if your family is acting a little distant. It’s okay to feel lonely sometimes, and it makes perfect sense that you do since you are alone so much. But it doesn’t mean you don’t have friends, that you don’t have people who care about you. It just means that  you’re a little nervous by yourself, that’s all. Being alone can be scary for anyone! That’s normal.”<br><br>Aimee nodded in agreement, not saying anything right away and sort of smiling at the fact that Kyle hadn’t made fun of her or told her she was acting like a wimp. She wasn’t sure if she believed him or not, but it was nice to hear that someone else understood what she felt and didn’t act like she needed to suck it up or something.<br><br>“I know how much I want to be with other people when I feel lonely too, Aimee. It’s a natural human emotion! I know that whenever I’m having a tough time with something, I just want to crawl into bed and not come out until the next morning when everyone is gone. But those feelings will pass. And then I’ll feel better and glad that I didn’t do what I initially wanted to do, which was just wallow in my own self-pity.”<br><br>Aimee furrowed her brows at Kyle. “I never want to be around other people when I’m lonely,” she said. “I just want to be alone. But it doesn’t always help even if I do that, especially if it’s late at night and there’s no one else around to talk to or anything. When I’m lonely, there’s nothing that anyone else can do. The only thing that would make me feel better is to be with a guy who actually understands what I’m going through and wants to be around me. But you don’t see a lot of guys like that, do you?” She shook her head.<br><br>“It’s not easy to find guys who are as understanding as you are, either,” she said. “I wish there were more girls out there like you and Jessica. Guys like David are so rare in this world. I mean, who would think that someone like him would be friends with me?” She smiled sadly at her own words.<br><br>Kyle gazed at Aimee for a few seconds, then shrugged and said with a casual smile, “You’ve got to have something to balance out my craziness. Even though I can be a little  too intense sometimes, I’m sensitive to other people’s needs. And if being understanding is wrong, I don’t want to be right.”<br><br>Aimee smiled at him then nodded, as if giving him an answer. She felt completely relaxed and comfortable around Kyle. That hadn’t happened to her in a while, not to this extent.<br><br>He yawned and Aimee couldn’t help but smile. She yawned too as they got up and headed towards her room. Kyle said goodnight to her parents, who were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV, and Aimee said goodbye to him shortly after. She waved goodbye to him from the door and then turned around and looked at her bedroom.<br><br>Kyle had made her bedroom seem a lot cozier with his presence, she thought to herself. He had also made her feel less alone, a feeling that Aimee wasn’t used to.<br><br>She shut the door behind her and said goodbye one last time to Kyle through the window. She then closed all the blinds and locked her door, went over to her bed, lay down on it and turned off the light. She couldn’t remember the last time she had said goodbye to anybody and felt so…<br><br>Aimee sighed. She didn’t know how to describe the feeling.<br><br>It was a feeling of sadness, yet also a feeling of comfort, a feeling or warmth and hope for the future, she thought to herself.

Shannon's paintings begin to take on a life of their own and Shannon starts to feel like her paintings are her new family.,"the paintings were talking to her, and she responded back through them. When she felt close to someone, Shannon would often give her paintings as gifts and tell people that they were her family.<br><br>Shannon continued to paint and show her paintings around town, and people began to notice them. She was invited by various places to have an exhibit of her paintings, and she started to make a little money from selling them. This made her very proud.<br><br>Shannon’s uncle saw how much she enjoyed painting and helped to build a small studio in the attic of their house for her. She soon filled up the studio with paintings, and it became very crowded.<br><br>Katie Matthews was now a friend of Shannon’s, and she also painted. Katie didn’t think she was very good at painting but felt inspired by Shannon Daniels who encouraged her to draw and paint whenever she could. They often painted together when they were at each other’s houses.<br><br>Shannon continued her journey as an artist, and she entered a variety of exhibits. Her paintings became recognizable throughout the town, and people often stopped to look at them when they passed by.<br><br>Shannon’s paintings became popular enough that she was able to make a living from them. Her uncle helped her rent a small office in town where she sold her paintings.<br><br>She continued to enter art shows, and now even her painting teacher had heard of her and asked if she would show some of her paintings in an exhibit on campus for students who were interested in pursuing careers in the arts.<br><br>Katie Matthews entered the art show with Shannon Daniels, and they both displayed many of their paintings. They talked to each other about how much fun it was to see their works hanging on the walls at the art show.<br><br>One evening after all the exhibits were closed for the night, Shannon and Katie were looking at the gallery one last time. They were admiring their work when they noticed someone standing in the shadows staring at their paintings. Shannon and Katie quickly moved over to the entrance of the exhibit so that they could get a better look at who was standing there.<br><br>“Who are you?” asked Shannon.<br><br>The man stepped into the light and said, “I’m sorry. I just wanted to come by and see your paintings, but I didn’t mean to disturb you. Some of these paintings are really good, and the  one you have hanging up over there is especially beautiful.” The man pointed at Shannon’s favorite painting—a large red rose with green leaves and a red ribbon tied around it.<br><br>“Thank you for the compliment,” said Shannon. “Are you an artist?”<br><br>The man took a closer look at Shannon’s favorite painting, then he smiled. “You caught me. I’m Rosemary Jacobs, and I teach art at the high school here in town.”<br><br>Shannon felt compelled to tell Rosemary about her mother’s art class, and how much the painting meant to her. “I think my mom painted this, but she passed away a couple of years ago from cancer. It was the last thing she gave me before she died and it means so much to me.”<br><br>A look of compassion and concern washed over Rosemary’s face. “I’m sorry Shannon; I didn’t mean to bring up painful memories. I just wanted to say that you have beautiful talent, and I think your paintings are amazing. You should show these at the art festival next month.”<br><br>Shannon was moved by Rosemary’s kindness, and she really enjoyed talking to her. “Thank you, again, Rosemary. I’ll think about it. I appreciate all the compliments on my art work, but I haven’t shown anyone else what I’ve painted. This is my first painting class. My mom gave me some paints years ago, but I never really used them. She said they were hers when she was younger and she thought that I might enjoy them. So, I decided to pick up a brush and try it out for myself,” Shannon finished.<br><br>“I think you should share what you have created with others. I think it would be so great if you could enter your artwork into the art festival next month, “Rosemary said enthusiastically.<br><br>“I think I could do that, Rosemary. But I’m moving soon to a new house with my dad and Uncle John, and I really couldn’t paint in my new house. My old studio is in my attic, and it is pretty cramped up there. It would be such a mess if I tried to paint there. My dad suggested I contact  someone who had an office for rent. So, I rented the one you found for me, and now I can paint there.”<br><br>“That is wonderful! You are so talented and creative. What you create is beautiful, Shannon! You could have a really successful art career.” Rosemary was very excited about Shannon’s future career as an artist.<br><br>Shannon smiled, “I doubt that, Rosemary. But if it happens, that would really be great! I think Katie should enter her artwork into the exhibit too. We both would enjoy it so much, and I think our paintings would look nice hanging next to each other.”<br><br>Rosemary smiled, “I agree that would be a wonderful idea. Let’s call up Katie and ask her to enter the show.”<br><br>Shannon had forgotten all about the conversation with Uncle Jeff about entering her artwork into the art festival, which Shannon and Rosemary had planned to do that afternoon.<br><br>Rosemary hung up the phone and said, “Shannon, I have some exciting news. I just called over to talk to your Uncle Jeff and he said that you can submit your artwork for the art gallery show at college. Shannon, that is so exciting!”<br><br>Shannon was excited too. The prospect of having her artwork in a show was thrilling to her. “Wow, I am so glad you told me about it, Rosemary! Now I know what to do with all those pictures I have in my attic. Shannon’s attic was full of boxes filled with canvases. There were large canvases stacked on top of smaller canvases that were stacked on top of more boxes. There were paintings of all shapes and sizes in the boxes. Some were framed and others were not, but all of them had the same signature in the bottom corner. Shannon thought she recognized the signature. She thought it was her mother’s.<br><br>Shannon moved a box out from in front of her, so she could see better. The signature said: Shannon Daniels and below that was written: 1996-2009. Shannon wiped away tears and smiled. “I can’t believe my mom painted these pictures of me! They must have been painted when I was three years old, because I remember that is when my mom said I got paint on my dress and then on my hair too. I wonder why she never showed them  to me when I was a little girl?”<br><br>Rosemary looked at the canvases with Shannon. “I don’t know why she never showed you these paintings when you were smaller, but maybe now that you are older, you will be able to appreciate them more.”",1
"Valerie Marx wakes up in a dark basement, bound and gagged.","The basement was dark.  Valerie Marx had never been in a dark basement before, even though on television they always seemed to find dead bodies there.  She thought it was funny that they always found dead bodies down there, because she was pretty sure that if she were ever in a dark basement, the first thing she’d do was check for dead bodies.  You’d think that, at least.<br><br>  The basement smelled musty and damp.  If you left a banana down there, it would probably start to rot, and then the banana would smell like this basement.  Valerie wondered if she was going to die in this dark basement, because she had heard that was what usually happened in dark basements.<br><br>  She ran her hands over her body and felt a gag in her mouth.  Her wrists were bound behind her back with what felt like thick, rough rope.  The rope rubbed against her wrists making them raw and sore.  She tugged at the rope, but it was securely tied to a pole, which seemed to be securely tied to the floor.<br><br>  She wriggled to try and get herself free.  The only thing she could really see clearly was the rope that held her hands.  She pulled and tugged the rope, but it didn’t move.  She looked around for something to use as a weapon, an advantage to help her escape.  She saw a wooden chair and tried to pull that into her reach.<br><br>  “I’ve gotcha now,” someone whispered from behind her.<br><br>  She felt a cold hand clamp down on her neck.  She gasped and tried to struggle, but the hand was strong and the grip on her neck was tight.  She stopped struggling because she didn’t want to die and it appeared that there was no way out of this situation.<br><br>  “You know, I always like to do this at least once when I get a new victim.  If you make me use the knife, it’s less personal, but gags and ropes are more fun.  You should know that by now.  You’ve been doing this a while.  Don’t worry, you won’t be alive for long enough to really feel any pain.  It’ll all be over soon enough, but I’m going to enjoy being with you while it lasts.”<br><br>  “No!” she screamed, not caring that her voice would only echo off the concrete walls.  “Oh God, please don’t kill me!  I’ll do anything you want!  I’m so sorry and I’ll never do anything like this again!  Please!”<br><br>  Valerie felt her hands released and then she was being pulled to her feet.<br><br>  “Aww, did I hurt you?” he said.<br><br>  “Yes, asshole!  Let me go!” she screamed and struggled to get away.<br><br>  “No really, did I hurt you?” he whispered in her ear.  He was still holding his hand on the back of her neck.<br><br>  “You’re strangling me!” she said, trying not to cry.  She was terrified.  This is how she had always pictured it happening.<br><br>  “Oh, come on.  I could do this all day and you’d last about two minutes.  You are so not strong,” he said.<br><br>  He began to drag her through the basement.  There were a couple other people in the basement.  A man and woman were standing by a table, tying their hands to it.  Valerie saw a bloody knife on the table.<br><br>  “You’re next,” he said, as he dragged her towards the couple.  “We’ve got a lot of work to do tonight.”<br><br>  She felt his hand on her hip and then on her waist.  He held her close to him, like he was a caveman and she was the most beautiful woman in the world.<br><br>  Valerie didn’t know much about cavemen, so she decided to be quiet and just do whatever he wanted.  He was big enough to kill her if she didn’t and he hadn’t shown any signs that he was going to let her be free, so she kept quiet.<br><br>  They moved on to the next person.<br><br>  He released her hands from behind her back and ungagged her mouth.  He then spun her around to face him and took his hand and pulled her into a passionate kiss.  She tried to struggle, but he was too strong for her.  She felt his tongue move into her mouth and search around.<br><br>  “Ugh!” she said, pushing him away.  “What are you doing?”<br><br>  He held his hand up and took a deep breath.  “Sorry, I was just trying to keep the gag out of your way.  I just can’t stand to see a woman gagged.”<br><br>  “Oh,” Valerie said, still feeling a little violated and angry.<br><br>  They moved on to the final victim in the basement.  Valerie saw a man tied to a chair.  He was gagged and blindfolded.  Valerie wanted to scream for help, but knew that her voice would only echo down the basement.  She was going to die tonight and there was nothing she could do about it.<br><br>  “Sit down,” he said, pointing to a chair.  “I don’t want to have to explain myself.  We’ve got work to do.”<br><br>  When she sat down, he took her hands and tied them tightly behind her back.  He then spun her around until her back was against the chair.<br><br>  She felt his hands roving over her body.  She tried to",1

It’s a natural human emotion! I know that whenever I’m having a tough time with something, I just want to crawl into bed and not come out until the next morning when everyone is gone. But those feelings will pass. And then I’ll feel better and glad that I didn’t do what I initially wanted to do, which was just wallow in my own self-pity.”<br><br>Aimee furrowed her brows at Kyle. “I never want to be around other people when I’m lonely,” she said. “I just want to be alone. But it doesn’t always help even if I do that, especially if it’s late at night and there’s no one else around to talk to or anything. When I’m lonely, there’s nothing that anyone else can do. The only thing that would make me feel better is to be with a guy who actually understands what I’m going through and wants to be around me. But you don’t see a lot of guys like that, do you?” She shook her head.<br><br>“It’s not easy to find guys who are as understanding as you are, either,” she said. “I wish there were more girls out there like you and Jessica. Guys like David are so rare in this world. I mean, who would think that someone like him would be friends with me?” She smiled sadly at her own words.<br><br>Kyle gazed at Aimee for a few seconds, then shrugged and said with a casual smile, “You’ve got to have something to balance out my craziness. Even though I can be a little  too intense sometimes, I’m sensitive to other people’s needs. And if being understanding is wrong, I don’t want to be right.”<br><br>Aimee smiled at him then nodded, as if giving him an answer. She felt completely relaxed and comfortable around Kyle. That hadn’t happened to her in a while, not to this extent.<br><br>He yawned and Aimee couldn’t help but smile. She yawned too as they got up and headed towards her room. Kyle said goodnight to her parents, who were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV, and Aimee said goodbye to him shortly after. She waved goodbye to him from the door and then turned around and looked at her bedroom.<br><br>Kyle had made her bedroom seem a lot cozier with his presence, she thought to herself. He had also made her feel less alone, a feeling that Aimee wasn’t used to.<br><br>She shut the door behind her and said goodbye one last time to Kyle through the window. She then closed all the blinds and locked her door, went over to her bed, lay down on it and turned off the light. She couldn’t remember the last time she had said goodbye to anybody and felt so…<br><br>Aimee sighed. She didn’t know how to describe the feeling.<br><br>It was a feeling of sadness, yet also a feeling of comfort, a feeling or warmth and hope for the future, she thought to herself. She thought Kyle had said goodbye to her before, but it didn’t seem as real as this did, like Aimee had just said goodbye to someone who she knew could be trusted with her secrets and who would still be there for her when she needed him. <br><br>It was a feeling that Aimee had only felt once before, she thought to herself.<br><br>Aimee got up off of her bed and went over to her bookcase, opened one of the drawers at the bottom of it and started putting away her books.<br><br>She was feeling less and less like sleeping, but she knew that she had a long day ahead of her tomorrow at work, so she turned off the light, closed her eyes and tried to sleep.<br><br>But sleep wouldn’t come. It never did anymore these days, but Aimee rarely ever complained about it, because she knew that there were people who had it worse than her.",1
"Shannon commits suicide, leaving her husband and young son behind.","that he wanted them to come over to him.<br><br>    Brad stood up and walked over to Emily. He lifted her and put her on his lap. She put her head on his chest and fell asleep in no time. He stood up again and walked over to Nathan, lifted him up, carried him into his room, and laid him in his bed. He sat down on the bed next to Nathan and rubbed his back as he snuggled into his pillow.<br><br>    Brad looked at the computer screen and started typing in the document. “I wish I could have saved you from all of your pain,” he said as he closed the document. “You didn’t deserve to die in that hospital bed. I will miss our late night talks about the past. You were my only true friend,” he said as he closed the computer screen and went to bed. He laid in bed until his eyes got heavy, then he fell asleep with one thought running through his mind. “If only I had just believed you.”<br><br>    Brad awoke the next morning with his alarm buzzing in his ear. He turned it off and rolled over to see that it was already 8:50 am. He looked over at Emily in her bed and she was still asleep. Brad got up and rushed into the bathroom to take a shower. Once he was clean, he walked into the living room to find Nathan already up and watching cartoons.<br><br>    “Have you had breakfast yet?” Brad asked.<br><br>    “No daddy,” said Nathan.<br><br>    “Would you like some breakfast?” Brad asked.<br><br>    “Yes, please,” said Nathan.<br><br>    Brad pulled out a box of Lucky Charms from the cupboard and put some cereal in a bowl for Nathan. He then grabbed another box and poured in some strawberry yogurt and gave it to Emily. He fixed himself a bowl of Lucky Charms and sat down to eat in front of the TV.<br><br>    Brad could hear Emily playing with her toys while he ate. “Daddy, do you want to play with me?” Emily asked.<br><br>    “I would love to, but I have to finish my cereal first,” Brad said.<br><br>    “Okay, daddy,” Emily said as she walked back into her room and picked up one of her coloring books.<br><br>    Brad finished his cereal a few minutes later and decided to get the day started. He went to his computer and pulled up his emails. He started reading through them and then decided to check out what was happening on the news.<br><br>    “And in other news, a shooting took place this morning at the University of Texas at Austin,” said the news reporter. “At least twenty-eight people were killed in the shooting and at least another 28 were wounded. It is believed that the gunman was a student who went on a shooting rampage through campus. The shooter has been identified as a 22-year-old African American male named Jamal Morris. Police have not yet revealed a motive for the shooting.”<br><br>    Brad turned off the TV and looked at his daughter, who was standing next to him. “Emily, do you remember seeing anything strange happen this morning?”<br><br>    “Yeah daddy, I saw a guy with a gun. I think he went to the building with the clock,” Emily said.<br><br>    “And what building is that?” Brad asked.<br><br>    “It’s the one that is shaped like a clock; it’s the one where all the classes are,” Emily said.<br><br>    “You mean the LBJ building?” Brad asked.<br><br>    “Yeah, that’s the one,” Emily said.<br><br>    Brad walked over to the TV and turned it back on. The camera was on a building that was shaped like a clock with the hands pointed toward 9:25 am. There were police officers all around the building. Brad pulled out his cell phone and started calling Sarah. “Hello,” he said when she answered the phone.<br><br>    “Brad, are you okay? Can I come get the kids?” she asked.<br><br>    “No, it’s not a big deal. I just saw some footage of the shooting. I’ll come get you,” Brad said.<br><br>    “Okay, I’ll be waiting outside.”<br><br>    “I’ll be there in ten minutes,” Brad said as he hung up the phone.<br><br>    Brad went to the hall closet and got two of his kids’ backpacks. He put their backpacks in the car and then locked up the house. He got in the car and drove to Sarah’s office.<br><br>    When they arrived, Sarah was waiting for them in her car. “It’s so good to see you. I was getting worried about you guys,” Sarah said as she got out of her car. Brad got out of his car and went to give her a hug.<br><br>    “Yeah, I’m sorry I didn’t call you. I couldn’t get a hold of you last night,” Brad said as he walked back to his car.<br><br>    “I know that it’s really hard to get ahold of me, so I try to be good about calling you guys back. I wanted to talk with you last night, but my phone ran out of battery,” Sarah said.<br><br>    “It’s okay sweetheart,” Brad said. Brad got in the car and they drove off to the school.<br><br>    “Do you want me to drop you guys off at school?” Sarah asked",1
Gabriel moves out of his parents' house and into his own apartment.,"I woke up this morning, ready for a new beginning. I’d spent the past week packing up my stuff and getting ready to move out of my parents’ house and into my first apartment. I got the keys to the place last night and put all my stuff in the car. This morning, I picked up my stuff, drove it over to the apartment building, and got to work unloading it.<br><br>The place was a complete dump. The carpets were a different color from the walls and the hallway, the paint was chipped in many places, there were burn marks on the stove, and the refrigerator’s ice dispenser was completely filled with dust. I don’t know why I didn’t see any of this before I signed the lease. I guess that’s why they say “Don’t judge a book by its cover.”<br><br>In any case, there was nothing I could do about it now. I had to get my stuff into the apartment and made sure it was livable before the end of the day. So, I went to work.<br><br>It took me a little longer than I thought it would to box up everything and move it from my car into the apartment. I didn’t have any help, so everything had to be done by me. The place was on the second floor, so I had to lug all my stuff up a flight of stairs and into the place. I was already starting to feel worn down by all the work before I even started.<br><br>In the end, I managed to move all my stuff in by around noon. There were still a few items like the TV that needed to be moved, but I figured it would be better to get everything else in place first. The place was mostly set up by that point, so I figured I’d take a break and get some food. I was hungry and hadn’t eaten since yesterday, so I went down to the local Wendy’s and got myself a meal.<br><br>I hadn’t eaten there in a while, so I was glad to know that nothing had changed. The place was still really gross and the people working there were just as incompetent as usual. I got my meal, left, and took it back to the apartment. It was pretty good, but I was hungry enough to almost eat everything.<br><br>After eating, I stretched out on the floor of the living room and laid down for a quick nap before I started unpacking. I slept for about an hour, then got up and got back to work. I started with the TV, which I was able to get into place without any problems. The TV was one of those old box-style TVs that were so big they didn’t even fit in the entertainment center very well. It was big and heavy, but it was also pretty easy to get into place.<br><br>I set up everything else in the apartment pretty easily. It was mostly just setting up furniture, putting things away, and making sure everything worked. I took a break to call my mom and tell her how things were going. She sounded proud of me for moving out on my own, but I could hear the sadness in her voice as well. She loved having me at home, but she knew that it was time for me to move out.<br><br>After speaking to my mom, I went back to work. I had everything pretty much set up by the time it got dark outside. I had one final task to complete before I could take the night off. I needed to make sure that the door was locked and that all the windows were closed and locked. The sun would set soon, so someone would be able to come into the building and steal my stuff if I wasn’t careful.<br><br>So, I finished up what I was doing, walked over to the door, and locked it. I checked the windows too just to make sure that they were secure. Everything looked good, so I took a shower and went to bed. It had been a long day and I was exhausted.<br><br> I woke up a few hours later, feeling refreshed from my nap. I stretched out in the bed for a few minutes, then got up and went to take a shower. I washed and shaved, then put on some fresh clothes.<br><br>I turned on the TV to see what was on. It was Sunday night and the only thing worth watching was a local news program. They were talking about the problems with unemployment in the area and how it was affecting everyone. It sounded like there were a lot of people out of work, but I knew that there would be a lot more soon.<br><br>I hadn’t heard anything about layoffs or anything like that at work, but I knew that we could be next. Our company had only been in business for a few years, but we had already expanded to several locations and were growing quickly. Even though we were doing well, I knew that we were probably in the perfect position to be absorbed and shut down. I was worried about what would happen to all of us when that happened, but there was nothing I could do about it.<br><br>I finished getting dressed and went into the kitchen to make a sandwich. I put on some peanut butter and jelly, then got some milk out of the fridge. Once I had finished my sandwich, I walked over to the living room and sat down on the couch. I turned on the TV again and sat there, eating my sandwich while watching a movie.<br><br>By the time the movie was over, it was almost 1am. I was feeling tired again, so I went back to bed. I ended up going to bed early that night because I didn’t have anything else to do and I wanted to be rested for the workweek ahead of me.<br><br> I woke up early Monday morning and just laid in bed for a while. I stretched out as much as I could, then finally got out of bed and took a shower. After getting dressed, I walked into the kitchen to make some breakfast.<br><br>I didn’t really have any food in the apartment yet, so I had to eat whatever was available.",0

Sally unexpectedly dies and Paula must deal with the guilt of her secret and the possibility of what could have been.,"them.<br><br>> getting up early will help you build your work ethic  Never thought of it that way, but makes a lot of sense. Thanks<br><br>I can agree with what u/Mr_Ortiz said. I used to train at 5AM but found the gym was empty and my mind just wouldn’t switch on when I woke up. If you love mornings and are disciplined enough to get out of bed then it’s definitely worth a try.  However, if you’re like me then you’re better off hitting the gym in the evening once you get home from work/school.<br><br>When did you start training at 5am? I started at 5am and I agree it was empty for the first few weeks, but after that, all of a sudden, there was a line of people waiting to get in.   For me, getting up early actually reduced my stress throughout the day, because I got my workout in right off the bat.<br><br>I started roughly a year ago. The gym was empty for the first few weeks but as soon as New Years came around all of a sudden there was a line of people waiting to get in. I found myself getting progressively more stressed with each passing day simply because I had to get out of bed.   As a student the evening gives me enough free time to hit the gym, make dinner and relax.</s>The problem with this kind of crap is it doesn’t stop with just that. For example, when your parents and grandparents die you are no longer connected to those people. It is just a short hop from that to saying other people never actually existed, because if they did then there would be a path from you to them.<br><br>That was what I was thinking when I read it too.</s>1. Technical Field<br><br>The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus including a processing unit which performs a process on a medium, and a cover which covers the processing unit.<br><br>2. Related Art<br><br>In an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine or a printer, a medium processing apparatus performing a process on a medium such as recording paper is generally provided along a sheet conveying path.<br><br>In such an image forming apparatus, in order to improve serviceability, a cover which covers a medium processing apparatus is generally provided. For example, in JP-A-2014-142210, there is disclosed a cover capable of opening and closing by sliding, and an image forming apparatus including the same. According to the cover disclosed in JP-A-2014-142210, an internal operation surface and an external operation surface are formed in a front of a main body. A cover body which covers an opening of the main body is slidably attached to the main body. The cover body is provided with a spring which returns the cover body to a closed state. Further, when the cover body is slid toward an open direction, by sliding the cover body, an engagement state of a plurality of engagement parts formed on the cover body and a plurality of engagement parts formed in the main body is released. Then, when the cover body is slid toward the closed direction, by pressing the cover body in a direction opposite to the sliding direction, the engagement state of the plurality of engagement parts is engaged again.<br><br>However, according to the configuration disclosed in JP-A-2014-142210, when a user presses a plate spring against the cover body from a back side of the cover body in order to slide the cover body to an open state, it is easy to cause a user operation mistake such as sliding the cover to a closed state.<br><br>In addition, according to JP-A-2014-142210, when a user presses the plate spring against the cover body from the back side of the cover body in order to slide the cover body to an open state, a strong force is needed.<br><br>Further, in JP-A-2014-142210, when a user presses the plate spring against the cover body from the back side of the cover body in order to slide the cover body to an open state, there is a problem in that an operation is not easy because the plate spring is hidden by the cover body.</s>WTF is wrong with you?

But it will get easier.” She said, slowly looking across at me and then away. “I know you don’t want to do this, but we have to survive. There’s no other way.”<br><br>	I started nodding, accepting the fact that she was right.<br><br>	“Go on, then. It won’t get easier. Trust me. But it will get easier.” She said, moving her hands towards her pockets. I stood up, putting my hand on my knife. She reached into her pockets, pulled out a roll of duct tape and a scalpel. I felt my body tense up, and my heart started beating faster and faster…<br><br>	“You don’t have to do this alone.” She said, moving towards me.

She was nice, but never liked me much.<br><br>	“Thanks. You should be doing this too.” I said to her, smiling a little as I looked away from her at the body.<br><br>	“I don’t like doing it. But we need to make sure there aren’t any more of them.” She said, walking slowly towards me and putting her hand on my shoulder to make sure I was okay. I pulled away from her, pushing myself off the floor and wiping my knife off on my pants.<br><br>	“It’s not that bad…” I said quietly, trying to ignore her. “It makes sure that they don’t get the chance to hurt you.” I said, looking down as my body started to tense up again.<br><br>	She smiled and nodded, slowly heading towards the body and putting her hand on its arm. “I guess so…” She said, pulling out a small knife and walking towards the body.<br><br>	I watched as she put the knife into the chest of the body, pulling it out and stabbing it into the arm on the other side. I felt my body tense up even more, as I had to think about how she was doing it.

It was such a weird decision to have him talk like that for five seconds.<br><br>Lol thats what I said. I was like ohhh you mean to tell me he was actually talking English the whole time?</s>You had me at “nose-fucking” 😍<br><br>Nose fucking is one of my favorite things ever!<br><br>I wish it was mine, too!   You have amazing content on your page. Looking forward to more!</s>If you can get ahold of it and have the money, do it. It’s a ton of fun, especially with the right people.<br><br>The right people is another reason I want to play it. I think my friends will enjoy it a lot more than I do, which is why i want to play so badly 😂</s>You could watch TV on your phone?<br><br>Yes. It’s hard enough to see what’s happening on most smartphones and tablets.</s>I did this last year! I had a great time. Anybody who is looking for a good league to join should jump on this while they can.<br><br>I did it last year as well, but man, the last 3 weeks or so are brutal.  Your schedule gets brutal in the last 3 weeks and it takes up all of your free time.   That being said, it was a blast.</s>I didn’t think I was going to like this one all that much, but it’s actually pretty awesome. If I had to guess, I would say the secret sauce that makes this work is the combination of the black pepper and allspice.<br><br>And, yes, that’s a different jar of mustard on my desk. That’s the only one they had at the store, and I couldn’t wait until tomorrow to buy a different one. Dijon is good and all, but it’s not my favorite.</s>I have the same problem too,  I don’t see how they could fix this with the current format of the site but I hope they do<br><br>They could do it through an overhaul somehow, I just don’t know how. One thing they could do is show your own post and comments first, or show your post and comments first until you scroll down a bit<br><br>It’s really annoying man, I’ve just accepted the fact that I can’t see my own posts<br><br>That’s probably easier than trying to get a reply from a Reddit admin, or trying to use the filters to avoid comments on your own post</s>I have that same type of carpal tunnel pain! Not as nearly as bad as in your case. I would ask the doc if you could go in for a steroid shot.<br><br>I have a cortisone shot when I was first diagnosed but the pain didn’t go away. They were thinking about giving me another one but I got pregnant and couldn’t have it done. I think I’ll go back to get one now since the pain is back!</s>That was a good, well informed article.  I really like that it talked about various places that support local businesses.<br><br>It was, wasn’t it? I’d love to support some of these places!</s>Yes. You can make any player you want a captain.<br><br>I think they meant to ask if it was possible to select between two players as captain and assistant, which it isn’t.</s>I haven’t noticed that in my personal experience.   It could be a coincidence but I have met more people who do not have children than people who do.<br><br>I can only speak from my personal experience, but it seems to be the case across the board from what I see in comments and posts on social media.  I think you haven’t realized because the childfree people are the ones that are posting about the bad experiences they have.</s>Please go to the police.",0
